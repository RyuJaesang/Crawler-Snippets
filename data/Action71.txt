          he is cut off as yakitito punches the wall again and
          again to punctuate his speech

                         yakitito

                         yakitito

                         ke
          no always you ask me question to ma

                         peyton
          catches the ball dribbles and throws it back to yakitito

                         peyton
          the answer yakitito

                         yaxitito
          snags the ball angrily from the air

                         yakitito

                         furious
          it is most strongly depending on
          temperature!
          he throws it at peyton who grabs it and pumpfakes
          yakitito not letting him have the ball

                         peyton
          go on!
          again he pumpfakes yakitito flinches

                         yakitito
          this means the temperature of the
          emitter is not critical as long as it
          is sufficiently high and as
          long as pure metals with high
          operating temperatures such as
          tungsten or tantalum are used
          peyton tosses him the ball yakitito catches it calm
          now he blinks

          peytons hand enters with a mug of coffee which he sets on
          the papers in front of her

                         julie
          peyton!
          julie takes the mug away it has indeed left a brown circle
          on the topmost memo
          julie smiles at him then

                         julie
          dale yes julie hastings yes i
          found some memos researching the von
          hoffenstein deal that i dont think i
          was supposed to find from the late
          mr strack to a guy named claude
          bellasarious theyre records of
          payments to various people on the
          zoning commission
          peyton behind her massages her back

                         julie
          they look like payoffs suspicious
          at the very least well the way id
          like to proceed is to talk to stracks
          son first give him the benefit of
          the doubt under the circumstances
          its the least i can do
          she hangs up peyton kisses her she leans back into his
          arms and closes her eyes blissfully reluctantly she rises
          and slips on her shoes peyton watches her admiring everything
          about her she gracefully lays her legal papers in her
          briefcase and heads for the door half way out the door she
          turns to peyton

          no thank you mr strack ive been
          going over some documents and i came
          across something that puzzled me its
          a memo from your office to a mr
          claude bellasariousit went out over
          your fathers signature it detailed

                         certain payments
          strack has gotten up to pace

          yes yes i know the memo
          julie continues hesitantly

                         julie
          it seems like the payments were

                         strack
          they were payoffs to the zoning
          commission bribes to call a spade a

          he gives her an appraising look

                         strack
          does that shock you

                         julie

                         quietly
          no in fact id surmised as much

                         strack
          but it disappoints you

                         julie
          well its hardly my place to

                         strack
          thats right its not your place
          yet i value your good opinion

                         julie
          surely you dont expect me to endorse
          it

                         strack
          course not im sure my father never
          intended for you to know about it
          im sorry if hes compromised
          you in any way but i am asking you
          to understand im not going to bore
          you with that old speech about how we
          all have to swim in the same
          pond but you know as well as i that

          not so much as one minimall ever went
          up in this city without some grease
          being laid into the palms downtown
          youre not naive you know
          its a cost of doing business
          ordinarily you dont have to face it
          well i face it and a lot worse
          into acynicthats the easy way out
          and im tougher than that
          strack gestures towards a tabletop architectural model of
          the riverfront development

                         strack
          take a look at that model julie
          that was my fathers dream now its
          my dream acres of riverfront
          reclaimed from decay thousands of
          jobs created a building blocka very
          large building blocklaid for the
          future not such a bad dream as
          dreams go and if the price of
          realizing that dream is the occasional
          distasteful chore well

                         beat
          the point is my father is well
          beyond the reach of the law but that
          memo could embarrass strack
          enterprises

                         julie
          all right youre point is well taken
          but the fact remains that im in
          possession of evidence of the
          commission of a crime you can no
          more ask me to destroy it than i could
          ask you to destroy one of your
          buildings

                         strack
          let me suggest this you excuse
          yourself for a few minutes go to the
          ladies room leaving your briefcase
          here what happens to the memorandum

          ten years ago pain from the burns
          would have been intolerable the guy
          would have spent the rest of his

          technique quite simply we sever his

          for dramatic effect

                         resident
          and he cant even feel it

          of course there are serious emotional
          side effects to this operation when
          the body ceases to feel when so much
          sensory input is lost the patient
          becomes alienated the mind cut off
          from its regular diet of input has a
          neversatisfied thirst alienation
          gives rise to loneliness anger
          uncontrolled rage is not uncommon
          and the rage problem is exacerbated by
          the chemical effect of severing the
          nerve now surges of adrenaline flow
          unchecked through body and brain
          giving him the strength of dozen men

          wrapd around his thickening midriff walks across
          the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment a
          mahler symphony plays in the background
          he bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
          rests on a marble stand then grunting under the
          strain of the load he staggers back across the room
          to the kingsized bed
          with a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
          out onto the bed a torrent of golden icrugerands
          they wash over the bed so many that some spill over
          the sides and clatter to the floor
          strack pauses for a beat staring down at the booty
          then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
          floor
          like a swan he dives
          he rolls luxuriating in the feel of gold against
          flesh laughter bubbling from his lips
          gold coins stick to his flushed sweating flesh then
          slough off leaving their imprint
          strack makes swimming motions with his arms laving
          himself with the golden coins
          a knock at the door
          strack freezes

          slips into the pedestrian traffic

          as we roll end credits

          any one of who could be darkman we continue to pull
          back down avenues and sidestreets byways courtyards
          wherever the crowd spills into an alley as a street
          person shuffles into view

          467 a muscular hand 467
          snaps open a switchblade a second set of arms grabs
          the street person and spins him around revealing

          the charred skull of darkman
          wild halfmad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets
          mandibles yank back and through a lipless smile he

                         rasps

                         darkman

          run for your life

          cut to black
