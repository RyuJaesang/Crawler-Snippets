          detective goes into the adjoining dining room he opens the
          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
          the double doors they are locked and the gaps are also taped
          up he turns to the right and goes into the living room

          with their phones switched on hasten to comply then the
          lights go out applause

          attempted forced entry
                         
          georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
          grooves
                         
                          georges

          in the hallway

          his in the closet

           the wall cut out all of the
           valuable pictures from their frames
           and disappeared without a trace
                         
          he goes toward the kitchen
                         
                          georges
           they must have been professionals
                         
          as he passes in front of the bathroom he stops and appears
          to be looking at anne
                         
                          georges contd

          with a gentle laugh georges disappears into the kitchen
          where he turns on the lights we hear him fiddling around
          apparently getting a glass and some wine after a short
                         pause

          after a while the ringing of a kitchen eggtimer leads us to
          the next scene
                         
          scene 8  int kitchen  day

          half set for breakfast he has mobile phone raised to his ear

           the saltcellar is empty

          with it as she doesnt react he realizes the
          inappropriateness of such an expectation gets up himself
          heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar

          he waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously
                         
                          georges contd
           helllloooo!!! cuckoo!!! im here!
                         
          she continues to look at him without reacting
                         
                          georges contd

          leans over the table to sit beside her tries to make her
          turn toward him
                         
                          georges contd

          he manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him but
          her eyes look through him
                         
                          georges contd
           annewhats
                         
          he takes her face in both hands and turns toward him
                         
                          georges contd
           anne
                         
          she stares into the void he drops his hands then sits
          beside her for quite awhile
                         
                         silence
                         
          finally he gets up heads for the sink turns on the tap
          wets a tea towel wrings it out a little comes back and
          places it on annes face waits for a reaction that doesnt
          come then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
          applies the cloth there then sits down and looks at her
          imploringly
                         
                          georges contd
           close to tears
           annedarlingplease!
                         
          once again they both remain seated in the background we
          hear the gushing of the tap that in his panic he has
          forgotten to turn it off
                         
          making a sudden decision he gets up rapidly crossing the
          hallway he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
          agitatedly which takes him quite a lot of time suddenly
          the gushing of the tap stops which had accompanied us as far
          as the bedroom
                         
          george doesnt notice it immediately then he stops short
                         
                          georges contd
           anne
                         
          finally he returns half dressed into the kitchen
                         
          anne is seated in the same place and looks at him
                         
                          anne
           what are you doing
                         
          she turns toward the breakfast
                         
                          anne contd

          georges stares at her
                         
                          georges
           both aghast and furious

           completely crazy is this supposed
           to be a joke or whats going on
                         
          she looks at him with amazement
                         
                          anne
           what did you say

          georges comes from the door to the table
                         
                          georges

           on earths the matter!!
                         
          georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone
          but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken he
          tries to calm down takes his chair that has remained beside
          anne sits down and looks at his wife she doesnt know how
          to react

          georges first looks away reluctantly then looks at anne he
          doesnt want to believe that its serious
                         
                          georges

                          georges
           almost reluctantly bowing his head
           as he speaks you were sitting
           there staring at me you didnt
           answer me when i asked you what the
           matter was
                         
          he picks up the wet tea towel from the table
                         
                          georges contd
           i put this tea towel on your face
           and you didnt react
                         
          anne looks at the towel then at georges and shakes her
          head perturbed that she cant understand georges looks at
          her he sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe
                         
                          georges contd
           look theres still dampness on
           your collar
                         
          anne follows his gesture tugs on her collar and sees the
          damp marks she slowly grasps that something is awry
                         
                          anne
           when when was it
                         
                          georges

          drinks it up when she wants to refill her cup she
          completely misses her aim she notices it puts down her cup
          and bursts into tears

           the haydn concerto it was very
           good geoff was there and
           congratulated him at the end
                         
          brief pause

           over the winter he suddenly
           discovered his passion for a viola
           player whod been in our ensemble
           for years what can i tell you it
           was a huge drama and the poor
           little darling wound up trying to
           commit suicide that scared him and
           he came back to me in full remorse
           ive got used to it now whats a
           bit embarrassing is that the
           ensemble you cant keep any
           secrets from anyone
                         
                          georges
           do you love him

           scared she was confused and
           scared you know she has always
           been afraid of doctors they said
           the risk was very low and that if
           they didnt operate shed be
           certain to have a serious stroke
                         
                          eva
           and what do they say now

          she doesnt know what to say

           embarrass you but when i came here

           for me at the time it was
           reassuring it gave me a feeling
           that you loved each other and that
           wed always be together

          stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first
          paramedic

          leave the apartment passing the superintendent as they go

          the superintendent hesitates another moment
                         
                          anne contd
           yes thanks

          he leaves the apartment
                         
          there is a brief moment of perplexity then georges says
                         
                          georges
           with a nervous smile
           where do you want
                         
                          anne
           in the living room
                         
          georges pushes her toward the living room door walks around
          the wheelchair opens the door comes back behind the
          wheelchair and pushes anne into the living room
                         
          the doorway is narrow the wheelchair only just passes
          through it georges pushes anne toward the sofa and the
          armchairs and then steps in front of her
                         
                          georges
           shall i make some tea
                         
                          anne
           with a faint smile
           first come sit with me
                         
          george registers her smile he knows hes behaving in a
          clumsy way he sits down in one of the two arm chairs
                         
                          anne contd
           can you help me into the chair
                         
          georges stands back up
                         
                          georges
                          eagerly
           of course
           18
                         
                         
          he extends his hands she puts on the wheelchair brake lifts
          the footrest with her left foot raises her right leg from
          the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
          to georges
                         
                          anne
           its best if you put my arm around
           your neck and your right arm around
           me that way itll be easy
                         
          he does as he is told pulls her up as they hobble together
          the short distance to the second arm chair cautiously he
          lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight because
          they are not used to it the whole process appears awkward
          and clumsy
                         
                          anne contd
           thanks
                         
          he smiles because it seems silly to him to answer dont
          mention it then he sits down opposite her
                         
          long pause
                         
          at first they are both ill at ease but then they accept the
          fact that words do not come easily after a long while
          during which we hear the intermittent sound of the traffic
          below
                         
                          georges
           softly almost to himself
           im glad youre back
                         
                          anne
           in a voice just as soft
           me too
                         
          another pause then anne says
                         
                          anne contd
           promise me one thing

          there waiting and runs her healthy left hand through her
          hair to make herself look prettier then smooths out the
          blanket that has slipped out of place a little after a
          while we hear georges shouting

          in his hand

          to open it its not easy for her
                         
          then she notices that shes forgotten her glasses she rests
          the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on
          the night stand in the end she manages it then she opens

            some banal romance or other
           about a nobleman and a lower middle
           class girl who couldnt have each
           other and who then out of sheer
           magnanimity decide to renounce
           their love  in fact i dont quite
           remember it any more in any case
           afterwards i was thoroughly
           distraught and it took me a bit of
           time to calm down in the courtyard
           of the house where grandma lived
           there was a young guy at the window
           who asked me where id been he was
           a couple of years older than me a
           braggart who of course really
           impressed me to the movies i
           said because i was proud that my
           grandma had given me the money to
           go all alone to the cinema

           what did you see i started to
           tell him the story of the movie
           and as i did all the emotion came
           back i didnt want to cry in front
           of the boy but it was impossible
           there i was crying out loud in the
           courtyard and i told him the whole
           drama to the bitter end
                         
                          anne
           so how did he react
                         
                          georges
           no idea he probably found it
           amusing i dont remember i dont
           remember the film either but i
           remember the feeling that i was
           ashamed of crying but that telling
           him the story made all my feelings
           and tears come back almost more
           powerfully than when i was actually
           watching the film and that i just
           couldnt stop
                         
          she looks at him smiles then turns back to her food

           unkind but i just dont see the
           point of talking about it all the
           time
                         
          short pause

          scene 20  int hallway  living room  day
                         
          the front door is unlocked from the outside and georges
          enters hes back from the funeral dressed for the occasion
          he turns on the light hes wet clearly its been raining
          as he closes the door again his eyes fall on anne with her
          back to him she is sitting on the floor in front of the
          opened window of the light well half propped against her
          wheelchair
                         
                          georges

          the wheelchair outside in the light well it is raining
                         
          pause
                         
                          anne
           once shes seated in the
                          wheelchair

           is it
                         
          pause
                         
          georges has understood immediately he closes the window
          noiselessly
                         
          then just stands there at a loss
                         
          silence then
                         
                          anne contd
                          softly
           forgive me i was too slow
                         
                          georges
           anne
                         
                          anne

           room
                         
          pause
                         
                          georges
           yes
           28
                         
                         
          he turns toward her pushes the wheelchair into the living
          room between the two armchairs turns on the light stops
          beside the switch they both look exhausted
                         
                          georges contd
           youre always good at surprises
                         
                          anne
           yes why are you home earlier
                         
                          georges
           i didnt come home earlier i took
           a taxi in august there isnt a
           lot of traffic
                         
                          anne
           thats true how was the funeral
                         
                          georges
           anne!
                         
                          anne
           how was it go on tell me!
                         
          he thinks an instant then goes and sits down facing her in
          an armchair looks at her she raises her head and returns
          his look he understands that he cant insist right now long
          pause then he begins
                         
                          georges
           it was rather bizarre the priest
           was an idiot then one of pierres
           coworkers made a speech that was
           embarrassingly emotional his old
           secretary came with a radio
           cassette player and after the
           speech she put on yesterday by
           the beatles you cant imagine
           everybody turned round to look at
           her apparently it wasnt planned
           his grandchildren were there of
           course they giggled as soon as the
           music began then the urn was put
           on a huge stretcher that was
           obviously designed for a coffin
           and out we went into the rain they
           placed the urn on a small electric
           cart that crawled along for what
           seemed like an eternity to the tiny
           hole they had dug a lot of people
           had to stifle their laughter it
           must have been terrible for jeanne
           i have
           29
                         
                         
                          anne
                          interrupting him
           theres just no point in going on
           living i know it can only get
           worse why should i inflict it on
           us on you and me
                         
                          georges
           youre not inflicting anything on
           me
                         
                          anne
           you dont have to lie georges
                         
          pause
                         
                          georges
           imagine you were me didnt you
           ever think something like this
           could happen to one of us
                         
                          anne
           of course i did but imagination
           and reality have little in common
                         
                          georges
           but things are getting better every
           day well
                         
                          anne
                          interrupting him
           georges i dont want to carry on
           youre making such efforts to make
           everything easier for me but i
           dont want to go on for my own
           sake not yours
                         
                          georges
           i dont believe you i know you
           you think youre a burden on me
           but what if things were the other
           way around what would you do then
                         
                          anne
           i dont know i cant be bothered
           to think about being you im
           tired you tire me everything
           tires me i cant talk i want to
           go to bed
                         
          he looks at her finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair
          out of frame

          she is lying in bed the bedside lamp is on
                         
          we hear the radio coming from the living room a program
          about the fauna and flora of the south seas or something
          similar
                         
          scene 22  int hallway  living room  day
                         
          georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door on
          the doorstep stands the soloist male or female from scenes
          3 and 4
                         
                          georges
           somewhat perplexed but pleased

          he closes the door behind his guest
                         
                          soloist

           come with me
                         
          while they pass into the living room they continue to speak
                         
                          soloist
            and now an unexpected
           opportunity has arisen because
           françois mitry called me  you know
           him hes my agent  to say hed
           arranged for me to meet the boss of

          he takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and
          hands it to georges
                         
                          soloist contd

           no no thank you very much
                         
                          georges
           hold on ill just freshen up the
           flowers in this heat they wilt so
           fast

          but georges has already left the room with the bouquet and
          closed the door behind him the soloist looks around him
                         
          after a few moments we hear the voices of anne and georges in
          the distance without understanding what theyre saying it
          lasts a while
                         
          finally georges opens the door and pushes anne in her
          wheelchair into the living room
           32

           martin! what a delight how lovely
           to see you!
                         
          the male or female soloist has got up and doesnt quite
          know how to handle the situation
                         
                          soloist
           mrs laurent! lovely to see you
           too

           dont get up come on sit yourself
           down and dont look so shocked
                         
          the soloist sits down hesitantly georges pushes the
          wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down
          brief embarrassed pause
                         
                          anne contd

           in raptures after your concert

           euros

           your talent
                         
                          soloist
           shaking his head a little do you
           remember when you first gave me
           the bagatelles to play i was
           twelve at the time and in my
           youthful arrogance i said but why
           the bagatelles and you really
           gave me a piece of your mind
           33
                         
                         
          they both smile pause then he goes on
                         
                          soloist contd

                          eva
            thinking about whether it
           wouldnt be better to invest the
           money in an apartment block if
           inflation gets going again
           property is the only sure thing
           right now savings accounts pay
           175% at best four years ago
           geoff bought some stocks with a
           small sum of money and the whole
           thing collapsed so now were
           obviously worried unfortunately
           in the meantime other people have
           had the same idea and property
           prices are going through the roof
           since we came back from
           scandinavia i spend all my spare
           time looking through newspaper ads
                         
          to put an end to the pause that follows she adds

          we hear her pass in the hallway to go into the bedroom and
          her vain attempt to open the door

          seems upset by the situation as one would expect

          reluctantly eva heads toward her armchair and sits down

           day or we sing together most of
           the time i wake up around 5 at
           that time shes still awake then
           we change her incontinence pad i
           rub cream on her to avoid sores
           then around 7 i try to persuade
           her to eat and drink sometimes it
           works sometimes not sometimes she
           tells me things from her childhood
           then for hours she calls for help
           and then an instant later shes
           giggling away to herself or
           crying nothing of any of that is
           worth showing to anyone
                         
          silence eva looks down finally she says

          follows her into the hallway
                         
          he unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom

          georges has remained by the door after a while they both
          leave the bedroom cross the hallway to come back in the
          living room
                         
          georges closes the door for an instant he puts a consoling
          hand on evas shoulder then he sits down
                         
          eva trying to compose herself goes toward the window and
          looks outside suddenly she starts sobbing
                         
          after a while georges gets up and goes out of the room eva
          vexed blows her nose
                         
          shortly after georges comes back he has another teacup in
          his hand puts it down beside his on the table and sits down
                         
                          georges

                          georges contd
           but it does make you feel better

          he fills her cup

           story but you must be quiet i
           cant talk too loud it wears me
           out here we go when i was
           little well i wasnt as little
           as all that it was toward the
           end of primary school so i was
           about ten dad and mom sent me to a
           holiday camp they thought it would
           do me good to spend the summer with
           kids my own age we were lodged
           in an old castle in the midst of a
           magnificent wooded landscape i
           think it was in the auvergne i
           dont know in any case it was
           the opposite of what id
           expected we had to get up at 6
           and go for a morning swim not far
           from the castle there was a pond
           fed by an icy mountain stream we
           entered it running in a double
           file you know i was never very
           sporty they had a program to keep
           us on the go all day probably to
           nip any potential pubescent
           impulses in the bud  but the
           worst thing was the food the third
           day after our arrival there was
           rice pudding for lunch i hate rice
           pudding we sat at long tables in a
           huge hall i didnt want to eat the
           stuff and the housemaster said to
           me you wont get up until youve
           cleared your plate so after the
           meal everybody left the room and i
           remained seated in tears i had
           made a secret pact with mom i was
           to send her a postcard every week
                          more
           64

           if i was pleased with the place i
           was to draw some flowers on it or
           if not some stars she kept the
           card it was covered all over in
           stars after three hours i was
           allowed to leave the table i went
           up to my room got into bed and had
           a fever of 42 degrees it was
           diphtheria they took me to the
           nearest hospital where i was put in
           an isolation ward which meant that
           mom when she came to visit me
           could only wave at me through a
           window at some point i lost that
           postcard its a pity

          then georges reaches across annes body to get hold of his
          pillow and presses it over her face stifled sounds from
          anne everything that can still move in her body starts to
          move georges presses down heavily on the pillow lies on it
          with his whole weight for a long time until all annes
          movements stop then he sits up exhausted and without
          removing the pillow from her face remains seated beside her

          georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
          with anne in scene 8 and writes a letter pauses for
          reflection gentle cooing of pigeons scarcely audible
          suddenly georges starts
                         
          at the far end of the long kitchen beside the door between
          the kitchen units a pigeon is walking georges stares at it
          for a long time
                         
          then he gets up slowly and via the door located beside the
          kitchen table he goes into the adjoining room
                         
          on the sofa there he has set up his new bed he takes the
          wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen
          carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm
          georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
          over the pigeon but it manages to escape into the hallway
                         
          georges follows it this action is repeated several times
          the pigeon is more and more panicky starts to fly up
          flutters about in all directions georges closes the light
          well window to cut off its escape route this lasts an
          exhausting amount of time but he ends up capturing it he
          cuddles it against him rolled up in the blanket leans
          against a wall then holds it as if it were a baby

          from the adjoining room we see georges seated at the kitchen
          table writing finally we see what he is writing

          time already through the light well this time i caught it

          georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room staring at
          the ceiling os we faintly hear the sound of running
          water and from time to time the clattering of dishes
                         
          after a while georges gets up and goes into the kitchen
                         
          he remains in the doorway and watches anne who doing the
          dishes at first doesnt pay attention to him then notices
          his presence and shoots him a quick glance saying casually
                         
                          anne
           im almost done
                         
          georges continues to look at her unwaveringly
                         
                          annes voice
           you can put your shoes on if you
           want
                         
          georges looks at her an instant longer passes beside her
          goes into the hallway sits down on a stool beside the closet
          and puts on his shoes os we hear anne finishing her work
          she comes out hangs up her apron in the closet disappears
          for a few moments into the bathroom meanwhile georges has
          got up and looks in the bathroom where clearly anne is
          tidying her hair and sprucing herself up when she comes out
          again he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
          on
                         
                          anne

          the hook and they leave the apartment

          turns again toward the open windows through which we hear
          street noise then she sits down exhausted in one of the
          armchairs her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room
