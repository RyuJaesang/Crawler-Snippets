                 the government got scared in
                1998 to jump start peace talks
                it gave a coalition of guerrilla
                groups temporary control over much

                              orosco vo
                 but thereve been few talks
                and no peace and the colombian
                military cant get near the
                guerrilla zone especially around
                the town of caguan where the
                elc kicks ass and takes no
                prisoners


74   gordy                                                          74

                              orosco vo
                 and thats where we come in
                supposedly to help eliminate
                narcos operating in the guerrilla
                zone but some wellinformed
                people think thats just an excuse
                to hit the guerrillas themselves
                since theyre wrapped around the
                drug trade were there were
                involved if we stay the only
                real question is which vietnam war
                were gonna have the one some
                feel we couldve won or the one we
                lost

     shows rebels army troops death squads firefights and with
     atrocities and bodies on both sides

                   bottom line the place is as
                  dangerous as a snakepit youve
                  got the different guerrilla groups
                  cia fbi dea colombian
                  military us military right
                  wing death squads  and the only
                  thing theyve all managed to do is
                  destroy a beautiful country and
                  inflict suffering on the real
                  people hey im colombian and

      no one replies then a small colombian girl comes up and
      gets his attention she runs back up the trail a short
      distance and stops she draws a line in the dirt

                                                       continued

                                                              40

     she smiles at the sound of a sharp whistle however
     she runs back quickly passing gordy and rejoining her
     family her father hands her a machete and a zippo
     lighter says something to her whereupon the little
     girl returns to gordy and holds the items out to him
     beat gordy takes them

                                gordy

     the little girl runs back again and gordy watches the
     refugees disappear around the bend then turns back
     uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in
     the dirt looks down at it crossing over means he
     walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people
     to flee for their lives and

     just as gordy charged into the fireengulfed tenement
     past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way he
     now steps over the line and advances into colombia

     everything goes quiet gordy slows and suddenly
     automatic weapons begin to pop somewhere not close but

      enough to expose his injured thigh a bandage covers the
      wound made by the glass shard gordy unwraps the
      bandage revealing

      a wad of cash is hidden inside along with a photo of
      anne and matt a long livid scar marks the wound

      removes some cash from the wad and rewraps the money and
      photo inside the bandage

      toward the girl when

      gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door the
      thin federale sees him at the same time begins moving
      in on him

      gordy moves faster toward the girl   and

      the girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the
      cap and setting it on the bar where its easier to grab
      and then turns her attention to armstrongs antics

      the thin detective fights through the crowd after gordy

      gordys almost to the hat

      the thin federale closing in turns to run out the back
      when

      a strong hand stops him the hand belongs to the fat
      federale and now the thin federales there too
      wielding a stun gun where gordy can see it people in
      the bar fall silent everyone but armstrong whos
      finally hung the spoon on the second girls nose

                                 armstrong

                   fucking hat thief!

      armstrong takes a drunken swing at gordy but

      instead of hitting gordy armstrong accidentallyon

      jams the stun gun against his neck and 10000 volts
      surprise the armstrong neural network

      gordy moves against the thin federale in anger when

      the fat federale zaps him with another stun gun just
      behind the ear and gordy gets to know the floor too

      are getting out including the beaten man felix meets
      them the beaten man exchanges words with felix felix
      indicates gordys room as the beaten man continues to
      question felix

      gordy realizes hes fucked he cant get through the
      wall fast enough his eyes go to water dripping from a
      pipe leading to the washtub sink he moves to it finds
      the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap cranks
      shut the master valve on the pipe wraps his hands
      around the pipe and pulls nothing jams his feet
      against the wall for leverage and pulls harder and
      this time he yanks the pipe free from the sink he
      finds the rubber hose fits an end over the pipe

                                                      continued

      hes made in the wall he aims the stream at the hole
      thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
      harder and watches the jet begin eating away at the
      old adobe and brick just as it ate through the crumbling
      plaster in the spanish harlem tenement

      grenade falls and

      gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it barely the spoon
      just hanging on the end of his fingertips gordy cant
      use his other hand to get it he needs the hand to hold
      onto the car the grenade begins to slip hes going to
      lose it and just as it falls

      gordy does the only thing left he slips a finger
      through the loops of the grenade pin just barely snags
      the grenade before it drops to the road and then

      carefully slowly  praying that each bump doesnt jar
      the grenade off the pin  with his other arm shaking and
      screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
      case  gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach

      around it spoon and all grips the grenade in his hand
      holding the spoon down and yanks the pin and then

      loaded spoon if theyll do it if the spoon goes now

      whack! the wolf slams the butt of an ak47 against
      gordys skull gordy drops hard the wolf reverses the
      ak points it at gordys head about to pull the
      trigger when

      the woman lays a hand on the wolfs arm

      the photo in her hand glances up into her eyes again
      they hold the look a whole conversation exchanged
      without words then the wolf turns back to gordy lying
      in a pile on the ground beat to gordy 

                                 the wolf
                   you were just saved by your

      dark and dank excavated clay walls and floor heavy
      door a bare overhead bulb provides some light

      gordy lies on a metal bed frame one of his legs is
      chained to the bed hes in pain from being kicked 
      but the physical aches are nothing compared to the
      anguish he feels for having failed

      the doors unlocked and opens daylight streams in from
      above as the wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards
      he moves to the middle of the room looks at gordy

                                 the wolf
                   one of the men in the jail with
                   you in mompos is dying he was
                   burned in your explosion

      gordy just looks at him

      the wolf signals a bodyguard who crosses to gordy and
      frees his leg from the chain

                                 the wolf
                   you want to kill me come and
                   kill me

      the bodyguards are smiling gordy hesitates then
      springs for the wolf and

      the wolf immediately fells him with a choppylooking
      karate combination the wolfs no jet li  his styles
      a throwback even ugly but its wellpracticed and
      brutally effective even still gordy springs back right
      away and the wolf drops him again

                                 the wolf
                   you americans think you have all
                   the answers and really youre
                   so naive

      gordy comes up swinging gordys a barroom fighter if
      he can touch you youre in trouble he never gets
      close a vicious front kick folds him and a fist drives
      him to the floor the wolf stands over him

                                 the wolf
                    you see one peasant with a
                   gun and you never ask why he has
                   to have it you just run to give
                   your billions to the nearest
                   soldiers no matter how merciless
                   or corrupt they are

      the last kick really hurt gordy    hes slow rising

                                 the wolf

                   more bombs and more families
                   like yours will pay the price

      the wolf wants to pique him but this is pouring gasoline
      onto fire gordy explodes off the ground the
      suddenness and fury of the rush catch the wolf off guard
      gordy drives him backward slams him against a wall
      then hooks an arm around the back of the wolfs neck and
      drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen
      all his weight behind the punches trying to break ribs
      and crush them into the wolfs heart when

      a bodyguard slams the butt of an ak into gordys kidneys
      gordy takes the blow standing the guard delivers a
      second much harder shot and gordy drops to his knees in
      agony beat the wolf recovers from the hammerblows to
      his midsection and then

      he makes gordy pay for the punches lands blow after
      blow on gordys face beats the living shit out of
      him and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor

                   guerrillas were all around us but
                   left us alone then they made an
                   attack on the army nearby the
                   next night soldiers came to our
                   village they were led by
                   american advisors they
                   accused us of helping the rebels
                   our women were raped our men
                   were tortured our homes were
                   burned we crawled out into the
                   fields but they threw grenades
                   and sophia

       staircases lead from the balcony to ground level where
       across the slatepaved car court a wroughtiron gate
       opens onto the street

       high for him to jump but the courtyards ringed with
       trees  theyre not close but theyre not far either
       not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife
       and son a man who also slides down fire poles for a
       living

       gordy runs down the balcony gains speed jumps

       hangs on and slides to the ground and now

       way shes getting past him

       but thats not what selenas thinking she attacks with
       the crowbar and gordy can only retreat in the face of
       the vicious onslaught he finds a nearby garbage can
       its full heavy but he manages to lift it spilling
       garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the
       crowbar the crowbar thwocks into the can over and over
       the sound echoing loudly in the small courtyard

       selena swings again and gordy moves to block the hit
       its a feint she swings under the can and hits a leg
       it hurts like hell he stumbles but he stays on his
       feet still holding the can selena goes for his head

      then swings low again a wicked blow to the knee gordy
      stumbles badly this time selena breaks for the gate
      gordy sees her and with all his might slings the can
      across the slate pavers and

      the can takes selenas legs out from under her she
      falls hard gets back to her feet quickly and starts to
      run when

      gordy hits her like a linebacker slams selena against a

      around her thin neck selena squirms hard kicks
      backward going for the balls kneecaps insteps doing

      not in a position to do a lot of damage  and shed have
      to kill him before hed let go
