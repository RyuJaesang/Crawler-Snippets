          as phil climbs on top and kisses her he reaches over and
          turns off the light suddenly we hear the piles of
          pictures slide off the bed and hit the ground beat

          bed while ollie 5 plays with legos on the floor phil
          showered and dressed in a suit walks quickly past the
          doorway carrying a briefcase his eyes glued to a stack
          of papers in his hand

                         clara

          through the bedroom she lets out a yelp as her shin
          smashes into phils dresser drawer  hes left them open
          she kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom then
          stops in the doorway water covers the floor grabbing
          a towel she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror
          as she picks up her toothbrush she notices its wet as
          well

                         clara
          ech mine
          she rerolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
          brushing when she sees the sink  a jackson pollock of
          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste
          disgusted clara reaches for the kleenex box only to
          discover its empty she tosses the box in the trash and
          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper

          seeing the roll she sighs as she takes it out of the
          holder turns it around and puts it back so it rolls out
          as the credits end the talking heads song fad

          nt kitchen
          phil pen in hand is focused again on his papers as
          ollie now in the preppie outfit watches him and waits

          thinking a bit flustered she opens her vents again

          makes my never mind
          phil reaches over and turns up the air again tapping
          his fingers on the wheel with a sigh he gets fed up
          suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding
          toward the exit

          clara shuts her vents once again sending a powerful gust
          of cold air onto phils face biting his tongue he just
          leaves it blowing on him as they drive

          int the signature room

          signature restaurant on the 95t flcor of the john

          even the bathroom has sweeping views of chicago as
          clara leaves a bathroom stall she notices a nervous
          young woman washing her face over and over
          a knock and a slick looking man quickly peeks his head in
          the womens room

          slick looking man

          hands

          int bar  moments later

           clara finds phil at the bar downing handfuls of peanuts

          your name at the bar and you dont
          answer they give your table away so
          how about a nut

          answer!
          clara shakes her head then notices the young host
          searching for the party and starts focusing on him
          instead of phil as she thinks

          with a sigh frank hands clara her purse she rummages
          inside
          and quickly whips out her mini 409 spray spritzing
          frank right in the eyes with a shriek he falls back
          grabbing his face and dropping his gun clara makes a
          dash and grabs it as frank blindly lunges after her
          she knees him in the balls he collapses on the ground
          whimpering in pain she spins and points the gun at
          harry

          grabs the gun and keys then awkwardly hits harry as hard
          as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the
          gun

          phil v0 contd
          ok let me just start from the very
          beginning

          int police station interview room  a little later

          phil excitedly chatters next to clara at a table in an
          interrogation room in the police station across the
          table a young police officer takes their statement

                         phil
          we got to the restaurant late because we
          hit all this traffic on the highway

                         cl aaa
          the shortcut

                         phil
          what

                         clara

                         ugs
          i just think we might have made it on
          time if we stayed on the highway your
          shortcuts end up being long cuts most o
          the time

                         beat
          ok are you going to tell the policeman
          or and i gonna tell him

                         clara
          you can tell him

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         phil
          because you always interrupt me when i
          try to tell stories and every time you
          do it disrupts my flow

                         clara
          fine you tell it i wont say another
          word

                         phil

          clara and young policeman
          you got to the restaurant late

                         phit

          the way was a shortcut  and they gave
          away our reservation so we were at the
          bar and the host was calling out for
          these other people over and over

                         clara
          which is what they do right before they
          cancel a reservation anyway

                         phil
          i thought you said you werent going to
          interrupt me clara

                         c
          i just want him to understand we werent
          really stealing someone elses

                         reservati
          across the table the young police officer eyebrows
          raised watches phil and clara volley back and forth

                         phil
          do you think he really cares clara
          were just kidnapped chloroformed and
          almost shot! i dont think hes going
          turn around and book us for reservation

          young polio officer

          we pretended to be someone else who
          didnt show up for their reservations

          people must have something this mr
          stockton wants

          holbrooke chuckles phils about to say something when a
          look from clara reminds him to bite his lip holbrooke
          gestures to some cardboard furniture

                         holbrooke contd
          so have a seat
          holbrooke starts to sit down himself then makes a show
          of taking a large gun out of his shoulder holster and
          putting it on the table

                         phil

          phil looks to clara  can you get a load of this guy but
          claras focused on holbrooke

          holbrooke v0 contd
          yeah unfortunately terrence stockton is
          not a man you want to get on the wrong
          side of

          int holbrookes living room  later

          phil watches as holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav
          around his margarita glass with his extra long tongue
          clara listens intently eating some jicama slices from a
          platter on the table in front of them

                         holbrooke
          hes like a nicaraguan turtle  keeps his
          head deep in his shell unless he
          absolutely has to stick it out those
          photos must be really important to him

                         more

          holbrooke picks up the plate and margarita glass then
          crosses to his indoor composter adding the extra liquid
          and scraps

                         clara contd
          what does stockton do

                         holbrooke
          officially he runs a bunch of these
          exclusive private clubs downtown where
          his high powered friends go to let their
          hair down has one place called le
          passage another called the rainbow

                         clara

          interesting ive had some of my guys
          looking into stockton for years but
          nothing ever sticks to him hes very
          careful  ties up his loose ends and
          covers his tracks but with this he
          might have accidentally left himself
          open

                         be
          the th need to do now is keep you

                         holbrooke
          shakes his head
          wouldnt be stocktons pattern to risk
          ing this any larger than it is where

          phil scoots the paper back to holbrooke who squints and
          dramatically turns it sideways

          through the window we see holbrooke phil and clara
          walking toward the back of the building
          in the foreground a shadowy guy watches them then
          whispers into his walkie

          positions

          fbi building  moments later
          holbrooke uses a keycard on his keychain with a flourish
          to enter the rear of the building then leads phil and
          clara through the doors suddenly he stops and phil and
          clara freeze behind them
          at the other end of the hallway an fbi unit in
          bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of
          them agent #1 in the center obviously the agent in

          the agents try the door but are locked in agent #1
          tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass
          but its bulletproof he gestures and all the agents
          rush around to the front

          husband

          ext ridge  a few minutes later
          a lit up raucous party boat in a canal starts to pass
          under a roadway bridge up ahead as phil and clara trying
          to stay in the shadows walk quickly toward it phil
          glances back over their shoulders  the road is deserted

          the patrol car continues across and down the street 1ï¿½1
          phil and clara breathe a sigh of relief
          then suddenly a few blocks down brake lights the
          patrol car turns around and turns on its lights zooming
          back toward them

                         phil contd
          now you can say shit
          phil looks around  theyre in the middle of the bridge
          with no place to run then he notices the lit up party
          boat coming out the other side of the bridge beneath

          as shes yanked over the side clara clutches onto the
          railing with phil hanging onto her other arm they
          dangle above the water and the boat

          clara gets up and storms off clutching her arm walking
          down the side of the boat she passes a man down on one
          knee in front of an excited woman who nods accepting
          his proposal

          workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he
          holds the bench phil moves the bench back and forth

          blows out her hair at the mirror an attractive thin
          woman walks behind her toward the showers and they smile
          at each other in the mirror as the thin woman
          disappears behind the shower glass clara makes a mad
          dash for the lockers

          finally they hit the other side getting his bearings
          phil sees the towncar has entered the park after them

          people anymore

          and starts to gather the items from her purse
          something catches his eye she picks up the
          envelope that dora put in her bag

          as phil walks along clara comes running up behind him
          phil! phil!
          she steps in front of him trying to catch her breath

                         phil

          side cramp wow
          she hands phil the manila envelope and bends down trying
          to stop her cramp confused phil opens it and looks at
          the pictures inside his brow furrows

                         phil

          clara looks over his shoulder shakes her head and turns
          the picture the other way around phils eyes go wide

                         phil contd
          oh jeez its its

                         c
          its the mayor
          phil looks at clara taking it all in

          phil v0
          i bet this didnt have anything to do
          with stockton at first

          ext deserted streets  later

          phil and clara walk quickly down the street as they piece
          things together

                         phil
          the mayor must have gone to stocktons
          club one night he saw dora working
          there and obviously gave some sign that
          he was interested

                         clara
          so much for mr squeaky clea

                         phil
          her sleazy boyfriend ray finds out and
          convinces her to take him up on it so
          they could photograph it and blackmail
          him

                         clara
          they knew it was an election year and he
          would have to pay them whatever they
          asked

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89

                         phil
          but somehow stockton found out about the
          photos too and wanted that power over the
          mayor himself

                         clara
          so he sent his guys to the restaurant to
          intercept the gales and get the photos

                         phil
          but ray and dora spotted them and bailed
          before the mayor even had a chance to
          show up
          phil thinks he snaps his fingers

                         clara
          what

                         phil
          if we could find some way to get in touch
          with the mayor directly without anyone
          else knowing there actually might be a
          way out of this for us
          clara thinks for a moment a light comes to her eyes

                         clara
          can

          i never told you which cop it was

                         clara
          then we got to talking and realized how
