          as nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene a big
          crowd gathers around a coupé resting on its side in a ditch
                         
          suddenly! owl eyes pops from the wreck he leers drunkenly

          then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the
          rail to daisy

                    he sends over a selection at the
                    beginning of each season

          more and more and more shirts float down
                         
          the rumble of distant thunder
                         
          close on daisy time slows as shirts flutter like giant
          snowflakes down toward her slowly quietly her mirth
          transforms to sobs she hides her face in shirts
                         
          gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside daisy taking
          her tearstreaked face in his hands

                    its just it makes me sad
                    because
                         
          daisy glances in nicks direction
                         
                                             gatsby
                    why
                         
                                             daisy
                    because
                         
          a suspended moment daisy is incapable of speaking her heart

                    five lost years struggled on
                    daisys lips but all she could
                    manage was
                         
                                             daisy
                    its just because ive never
                    seen such beautiful shirts before
                         
                                             gatsby
                    if it wasnt for the mist we could
                    see the green light
                         
                                             daisy
                    what green light
                         
                                             gatsby
                    the one that burns all night at the
                    end of your dock

                    possibly it had occurred to gatsby
                    that the colossal significance of
                    that light had vanished forever
                    now it was once again just a green
                    light on a dock his count of
                    enchanted objects had diminished by
                    one
                         
          nick impelled to remind daisy and gatsby of his presence
          emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase
                         
          he holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume

          gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk

          as daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers
          we hear her reading the letter in abstract voiceover
                         
                              daisy vo

          gatsby crosses the room snatches up the receiver and turns
          away he lowers his voice

          gatsby rings off abruptly and catches nicks eye  a tense
          moment  which gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile
                         
          we hear the distant jaunty sounds of a pipe organ
                         
                                                gatsby contd

          daisy wearing a flowing robe and heels dances a charleston
          with nick
                         
          an elaborate picnic complete with candelabras and a mountain
          of cushions is laid out on the floor there gatsby sits
          looking on flush with joy
                         
          slowly though gatsbys expression turns introspective as he
          watches daisy dance memories flood back to him
                         
                                                                            dissolve to

          an array of memories and images dissolve one into the other
          gatsby and daisy five years ago about to kiss a hand
          written letter a gathering storm the green light

          hundreds of candles flicker in patterns as a slow
          melancholic waltz plays gatsby and daisy dance
          enraptured

          across the room nick exhausted and drunk and unnoticed
          stands to leave at the ballroom doors he turns back and
          glimpses gatsby and daisy in a universe all their own

                    i thought out my life with daisy in
                    it trying to figure out how we
                    could marry and struggle along on
                    so many dollars a month
                         
          finally nick is able to ask

                              nick vo
                    he had come such a long way
                         
          and suddenly shimmering ghostly through the rain gatsbys
          silhouette can be seen once more gazing out across the bay
                         
                              nick vo
                    and his dream must have seemed so
                    close that he could hardly fail to
                    grasp it
                         
          gatsby turns back towards nick and smiles
                                                                     132
                         
                         
                                nick vo
                      he did not know that it was already
                      behind him
                         
          nick smiles back
                         
                                nick vo
                      gatsby believed in the green light
                      the orgastic future that year by
                      year recedes before us
                         
          push past gatsby out over the water toward the green light
          eternally pulsing at the end of daisys dock
                         
                                nick vo
                      it eluded us then but thats no
                      matter  tomorrow we will run
                      faster
                         
          gatsby reaches out
                         
                                nick vo
                      stretch out our arms farther and
                      one fine morning
                         
          as we push past gatbsys outstretched hand the opening image
          returns the green light pulsing in the abstract dark
                         
          nicks final words appear as type on the screen
                         
                                nick vo
                      so we beat on boats against the
                      current borne back ceaselessly
                      into the past
                         
                                                                           dissolve to
                         
                         
          int santitarium  nicks room  summer  day
                         
          nick pulls a final page from his typewriter sets the page on
          top of his completed manuscript and we clearly see the title
                         
          gatsby
                         
          nick considers this and then handwrites
                         
          the great
                         
          dissolve through the final title  the great gatsby  to
          the green light it pulses one last time then fades to
          black
                         
          the end
