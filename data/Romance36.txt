           woods one day and he sees this rabbit
           also taking a shit the rabbit wait i
           mean the bear hes shitting up a storm
           cuz hes been eating mexican the
           wipings taking forever and his shit
           keeps sticking to his fur wait what
           happens next oh right he asks the
           rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping the
           rabbit says no shit just slides right
           off him so the bear picks the rabbit up
           and wipes his ass with him
           pause as if for applause

           useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
           beatles or any other cultural artifact of
           their generation even if i did spend my
           childhood hearing my father go on and on

           anything because theyre not the beatles

           there was something in annie hall i
           identified with maybe it was the style
           of humor or the defeatist attitude i
           dont know all i know is i kept going
           back different people are inspired by
           different things and my source of
           inspiration became a 20yearold movie
           about a failed relationship

           this morning we were skipping class
                         
           max and charles walk across the quad towards us at first
           they are only specks in the distance
                         
                          charles
           max youre insane
                         
                          max
           its ridiculous that even at a liberal
           school like this i have to put up with
           antisemitism
                         
                          charles
           so you got a c minus! dont you think
           youre getting carried away
                         
                          max
           he couldnt just fail me think about it
           the paper was about my grandparents
           experience in the holocaust
                         
                          charles
           your paranoia has always been out of
           control but this is absurd
                         
                          max
           you dont understand youre not jewish
                         
                          charles
           neither are you!
                         
                          max
           but the professor probably thinks i am
                         
                          charles
           and wasnt that the paper that you handed
           in two weeks late
                         
                          max
           you know what else i think he might be
           german
                         
                          charles
           professor wang will you stop it
                         
           we can now see that charles has a fedora cocked back on his
           head and is wearing incongruous vegas clothes

                          charles

           hall you watch the less successful you
           are romantically i think wed do much
           better if we watched say oceans 11
                         
                          max
           what are you talking about if youre
           sick of annie hall thats one thing but

           this over break ever since we started
           watching it what has your love life been
           like and mine every semester we watch
           this movie and then spend the semester
           alone
                         
                          max
           alone last semester you hooked up with

                          charles
           you know actresses dont count
                          poignantly
           im looking for a meaningful
           sophisticated relationship like frank
           and ava no more shallow dames for this
           cat
                         
                          max
                          agitated
           where did you get this grudge against my
           favorite film

                          max
           and anyway your theory fails to account
           for our collective dorkiness and bad
           haircuts plus look at sam

           more than you
                         
                          charles

                          charles
           hottie at 3 oclock keep an eye on her
           for me so it doesnt look like im
           interested
                         
                          max
           yeah right then if you fail to sodomize

                          charles
           look all i said was it would explain
           our lives
                         
                          max
           the problem is every crazy theory
           explains something i took a class last
           semester with a professor who claimed
           that the planet is being destroyed by
           white male meateating capitalists
                         
                          charles
           so everybody knows that
           20
                         
                         
                         
                          max
           but she had a theory that explained how
           apparently racism sexism socialism
           environmentalism and vegetarianism are
           all inherently linked i brought a big
           mac to the first class and i thought i
           was going to be the victim of a vegan
           socialist uprising

           the singer smashes the mic against the wall then brandishes
           the stand menacingly at the crowd who step back in alarm

           watch when things are going well
                         
                          charles

                          sam
           by the way max what ever happened with
           that girl you were seeing
                         
                          max
           she just ended a long relationship and
           she doesnt want anything serious
           106
                         
                         
                         
                          charles

           serious
                         
                          max
           no its dead and the thing i dont get
           is it was all going so well there was a
           moment when we kissed when it was more
           than a kiss
                         
          his openness is making the other guys uncomfortable
                         
                          max contd
           it was like we broke through all our
           layers you know all the manners and
           defense mechanisms and daily crap and i
           saw a flash of something a glimmer of
           hope or happiness or whatever something
           i inspired in her but now its over and
           ill never see that part of her again
                         
                          charles
           i think youre upset about not seeing
           some other parts of her again
                         
          the joke is halfhearted max has made everyone reflective
                         
                          charles contd
           shes a girl max theyll always be a
           mystery youll never know why they love
           you and youll never know why they dont
                         
                          sam
           relationships are incredibly complicated
           like polypeptide strings theres an
           attraction at first but if the bonds
           dont form right away nothing can make
           the connection work
                         
                          max
           theres a metaphor we can all relate to
                         
                          sam
           it was like with jen and i but i know it
           was for the best
                         
                          charles

           remote down
                         
          94 ext campus green ­ dusk 94

          beth looks him over as if for the first time
                         
                          beth

           109

                          max
           sure after the movie im doing my last
           radio show its going to be all
           requests you should tune in
                         
                          beth
           the end of an era
                         
                          max
           the start of a new one
                         
          he smiles and walks away the fog begins to obscure him
                         
          beth opens her backpack and removes a walkman she hits power
          and the led changes from tape to radio
                         
           max vo contd
           and thats how i let go of her although
           its probably more honest to say that she
           let go of me julie beth and annie
           three women in my life and i was
           desperate for one
                         
          reverse angle beth stands alone watching him go she snaps
          the headphones over her ears
                         
           max vo contd
           of course i saw her again its a small
           campus the last time was at a film
           festival were better friends now then
           ever and theres always a chance we can
           have some kind of future together so
           far so good
                         
          finally beth turns and walks away
                         
          cut back to max still walking getting smaller and smaller
          soon all we see is fog
                         
           max vo contd
           shell always mean a lot to me and its
           nice to run into her and reminisce about
           what we ya know went through it was a
           weird period of my life i mean shit i
           really got off track there didnt i
                         
           fade to black
