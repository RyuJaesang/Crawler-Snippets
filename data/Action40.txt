          close on the timer 0011 0010 0009
          
                                                                 109

          close on the timer 0006 0005 0004
          
          this time milo pops up high enough that we see his hands
          
          close on the timer 0003 0002 0001
          
          and finally milo is high enough that he can thrust the bomb
          out the window
          
          close on the bomb as it crashes into the water
          
          
          int hull of boat evening
          
          milo and cass both a little out of breath stand still
          listening silence
          
                              cass
                    think the water defused it

                    lemme ask you this has anything
                    gone our way yet
          
          suddenly a low roar from beneath grows and rises up beneath
          the boat rocking it wildly as water explodes on all sides
          
          cass and milo get drenched but are safe
          
                                cass
