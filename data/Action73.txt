    deadpool in full dress reds and mask quietly fidgets in the
    back seat of a taxi cab as it proceeds along a city freeway

    deadpool adjusts the two katanas strapped to his back rolls
    the windows up down up tries futilely to untwist the
    seatbelt then lunges forward locking it up rifles through
    a tourist booklet and tears out a haunted segway tour coupon
    the cabbie young thin brown glances back and forth from
    the rear view to the road to the rear view

                          deadpool
                kinda lonesome back here

    cut to deadpool wedging himself through the opening
    between the back seat and front his two katanas dont
    cooperate catching on the plexiglas stalling him midtorso

                          deadpool contd
                little help

    the cabbie grabs deadpools hand and pulls him through to the
    front deadpools head rests upside down on the bench seat
    as he maneuvers his legs through the cabbie turns the
    helping hand into a handshake then turns down the juice

    deadpool grabs dopinders open bag of corn nuts dopinder
    isnt quick enough to stop him deadpool gazes out the
    window onto the city  a teeming sooty urban sprawl that
    looks almost prepostapocalyptic

    deadpool turns up his mask dopinder catches a glimpse of
    the bottom of a scarred face and quickly looks away
    deadpool eats the corn nuts crunch crunch points

                 stolen by my cousin bandhu bandhu is as
                 dishonorable as he is attractive

      the man hollers in muffled agony a motorcycle has pulled
      ahead of the escalade and now sits stopped in its path

      the helmeted rider opens fire with a submachine gun

      deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the drivers
      neck still mashing his face into the window glass and the
      other hand still clamped over the second mans mouth he
      plants both feet on the steering wheel and drives spinning
      the wheel sending the suv into

      cigarette lighter the guy whose ankle is still tangled in
      the seatbelt flails through the air like a ragdoll ahab

    yelps in pain then stuffs some of his torn red suit
    fabric into the hole to staunch the bleeding

    then he scrambles around the suv trying to close the
    distance to this guy through a withering barrage of fire

    another of the aks slugs slices a swath out of the mask on
    deadpools head singing his hair

    forward and right

              im touching myself tonight

    but then as if by magic the third thug stirs and stands

    the slug has lodged partway in his forehead having lost just
    enough momentum that it didnt make it all the way through

    the thug sneers plucks out the slug wipes away some blood
    and rolls up his sleeves

     of rusty surgical knives nearby

     a man with a pockmarked face stands over him in a white lab
     coat with bluestitched cursive writing dr delgado

                          doctor
                buenos días señor abe

     doctor delgado pokes and prods with his fingers as if
     abes midsection is playdoh

                          doctor contd
                voy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo

     the doctors other hand dips below the table comes up
     dripping with something bloody he kneeds at wrinkled skin
     smearing the chicken blood across abes flesh

                          doctor
                de que se cure! señor abe you are
                cured

     the doctor holds smelling salts under abes nose his closed
     eyes jerk open to see the doctors gloved hand clutching a
     huge bloody tumor

     abe pushes himself up peers down at his bloody abdomen with
     awe the doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up

                          abe
                    tearing up
                thank you i owe you my life

     as abe shuffles out the doctor turns away to dump the
     tumor in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin

                          doctor
                    over his shoulder

     standing in the open door of the room looking dangerous

     wade walks slowly toward the doctor who steps out nervously
     from behind his table the two stand facetoface wade
     smiles angles his foot under the operating table

     and uses it to slide something out from underneath the
     table a bucket of bloody chicken gizzards that double as
     removed tumors wades rage seems to grow by the instant

     scalpel from his tray wade moves toward him delgado
     lunges he stabs wade in the shoulder then runs

     wade tackles him in wades weakened state the fight
     becomes an intense struggle the two fall and wrestle the
     bucket of gizzards overturns they roll around in slop

     hallway wade wriggles after him tugging at his ankle

     straddles the doctors chest his expression is that of a
     man whos losing his shit

     wade raises the scalpel slashes at the doctors throat then
     stabs him in the heart the doctor writhes spasms gurgles
     and falls still

     of the hall

     vanessa  frozen terrified a bloodsoaked wade locks eyes
     with her and swims back up into sanity what have i done
     this is a horrific glimpse into wades murderous past

     and the look on vanessas face is one of horror and pain

     past her in his socks drops his muddy boots to the floor and
     slips into a pair of powderblue crocs parked just inside the

       wade newly scarred hidden in darkness continues to gasp as
       though being held underwater then the lid on the punchbowl
       slides back revealing ajax wade takes deep lungsful of
       air ajax leans in for a closer look

                    the punch bowl merely raised your stress
                    to trigger the mutation

       wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all this
       information ajax smiles down

                              ajax contd
                    ive seen similar sideeffects before         i
                    could cure them for you but really
                    wheres the fun in that

                    im going to close this lid again     maybe
                    you no longer need it but i do

       for a long moment wade stares intensely at ajax and sees
       nothing a black hole of empathy and he knows this is a man
       who will never stop hurting him

       ***note we will not be reshooting the rest of the scene
       below with the exception of the final shot****

       so he turns his gaze to the ceiling and withdraws into
       himself the one place the cruelty can no longer reach him

       angel dust enters chewing on her usual matchstick

                              ajax

                    you smell like shit

       when angel dust leans close to wades head he suddenly comes
       alive and uses the strength he has left to headbutt her in
       the forehead

     as angel dust exits the tent she reaches to her mouth for
     her matchstick only its not there she frowns fishes
     another match from her pocket and tucks it between her lips

     ajax finishes strapping wade back down and goes to close the
     lid

                            ajax contd

                  sorry francis but my lips are sealed

     and then were inside the punch bowl with wade as the oxygen
     levels drop and the suffering rises through a fog of misery
     wade sees ajax staring down watching him drinking in his
     pain

     back in the punchbowl wade opens his mouth within which
     he was hiding a single matchstick clenched carefully  dryly
      between his teeth

     he inhales then spits out the match into his waiting palm
     finally he strikes it against the side of the punch bowl

     wade aims the now flaming match toward the tiny hole through
     which oxygen flows the match is quickly burning down will
     it reach the hole before it snuffs out

     at the last possible moment

     the flame combusts the stream of oxygen igniting it

     back through the transparent plastic tube that trails
     outside the punchbowl

     the flame snakes through the tube this way and that until
     it reaches the oxygen tank standing next to the punchbowl
     a beat then the tank explodes

     the   blows apart      the hospital bed snaps in two

     out in the ward the fireball curls outward spreading from
     tent to tent boom! boom! other flammable tanks detonate

     the tents go up like roman candles        its now mass chaos

     alarms blare    flames leap     smoke billows     patients flee

     a curtain of fire suddenly disperses replaced by billowy
     white smoke from an oversized chrome fire extinguisher

     held by ajax who strides grimly toward wades tent             he
     throws back the burning fabric

     and nearly eats an oxygen tank        he blocks it at the last
     moment with his fire extinguisher        clang

     on the other end of the oxygen tank windmilling it with
     unbridled ferocity is wade

     wade and ajax swing the oxygen tank and fire extinguisher
     like modern day clubs trying to take off each others heads

     clang!   bang!   bam!    the tanks collide in midair

     ajaxs fingers crunch between metal        he doesnt even feel
     it

     wade grabs the hose of ajaxs fire extinguisher angles it
     up and gets his finger on the trigger

     the extinguisher blasts      ajax is momentarily blinded

     wade brings the oxygen tank down like a lumberjacks axe
     ajax blocks it but is driven to his knees

     wades eyes are lit with fire down the tank comes again
     and again ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the chin
     then catches a blow from the oxygen tank to his temple

     the extinguisher goes flying wade swings the oxygen tank
     again but against all odds ajax catches it and slams it
     back into wades nose crunch

     ajax rises to his feet and the two grip opposite sides of
     the oxygen tank grappling with every ounce of strength

     wade sweeps ajaxs feet and he topples over backwards wade
     on top of him wade lifts the heavy tank and slams it into
     his face once twice three times crack

     as hes about to finish the job ajax smiles blood bubbling
     from his smashed lips

                         ajax
               you cant kill me wade im the only
               one who can fix that ugly mug

     wade looks torn as his rage gives way to something like hope
     he tosses the tank away

                         wade
               then time to make me me again

     a scream of terror behind wade makes wade turn

               wade!   help! wade!

     wade looks through the smoke and flame and spies a helpless
     cunningham lying in the flaming wreckage

                            wade
               fuck!

     wade drops ajax and sprints to cunningham starts dragging at
     the wreckage trapping him when slice! a long piece of
     sheared rebar thrusts clean through his chest from behind

       cypress tree from weasel

       he turns a lucha libre mask inside out to reveal the classic
       deadpool mask we all know and love puts it on then
       dresses  piecebypiece  in the red uniform weve come to
       know and love and at last unsheathes a katana the sword
       twirls slashes lunges into shadow a handkerchief wipes
       blood from the blade the katana gets sheathed again

       the same yellow card is now received and punched by weasel
       wade is paid in twenty dollar bills whip cream froths onto
       a shot glass a blowjob is tossed back

       meanwhile vanessa plays skeeball wistfully by herself at
       the arcade

       skeeballs roll into holes lights flash tickets churn
       out vanessa catches a reflection of someone staring at her
       from across the lobby when she spins around the culprit is
       gone vanessa shivers but its a warm shiver somehow

       a heap of tickets slides across the prize counter a big
       stuffed animal slides into vanessas arms vanessa tosses it
       into an empty closet inside her and wades former apartment
       then stares out the spiderweb crack in the window

       back at deadpools lair deadpool places various suspicious

      when the wall is covered he carefully pins the first
      ornament onto the first tree on the first calendar

      christmas morning has arrived all the calendars but one

     grabs angel dust by the scruff of her neck and hurls her into

     hanging out of her torn flak jacket

     of steel thrust! slice! impale! complete mayhem

     another trio of mercs rush around the corner opening fire as
     they see their comrades fall deadpool runs toward them
     flips and dodges like a whirling dervish bringing guards
     down in surgical artistic fashion as if where hes killing
     them means as much to him as how

     two men converge    on deadpool he jumps midair he flips
     his two katanas    grips them upsidedown like ice picks and
     stabs down in an    arc to either side skewering two men
     through the tops    of their helmets

     a final merc comes around the corner and deadpool spins
     slices the strap of his gun kicks the man in the chest
     knocking him flat on his back and sitting on his face

     the wing smashes into them    all four go flying       two end up
     dead under the wing

     ajax is thrown backward

     one merc lands stunned close to the edge     a long beat

     ajax rises to his feet

     then deadpool pulls himself up over the edge of the carrier
     and rolls onto the deck he looks like hes been through a
     meat grinder  limping scorched bloody

     deadpool staggers to his feet    the last injured merc lamely
     tries to grab his ankle

     axes each with an ultrasharp blade on one side of its head
     and an equally sharp claw on the other

     deadpool raises a katana and hurls it not at ajax but the
     punchbowl the blade penetrates the plexi and tears into
     the restraint holding vanessas right wrist partly fraying
     it air seeps through the crack vanessa catches a tiny
     breath she tugs on the frayed restraint

     the final close quarters battle between deadpool and ajax

     snap! ajax breaks the swords blade with an axe not feeling
     anything as he slides his leg off the sword

     clang! ajax wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel
     deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted railing from the deck
     barely blocks ajaxs windmilling swings

     finally ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from
     deadpools hands with one axe while the sharp claw end of
     the other buries itself in deadpools forearm deadpool
     hollers

     deadpools red suit has torn away and the skull of his
     tattoo bleeds from a hole in its forehead

     deadpool grits his teeth and yanks the axe from ajaxs grasp
     a spinning kick sends the second axe flying after the first

     now theyre completely unarmed

     head to one side and spies the punchbowl

     all her might with a squeal of metal the latch breaks the
     twisted metal flying off the lid as it slams open

     vanessa grabs the katana jerks it free with another mighty
     effort then slides down the containers toward ajax with a
     fierce scream she plunges the blade into his kidney the
     blade punches through the other side but ajax feels no pain
     yanks out the katana and throws vanessa aside violently

     loose wreckage begins to slide and tumble past a shipping
     container barrels towards them and deadpool kicks ajax

     inside and shuts the lid for protection

     they slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom of

     stares at the scrapyard below huge chunks of metal slide
     and smash past to tumble to the ground a hundred feet below
