ext city streets los angeles  night

credit sequence

as opening credits play we study the citys nighttime
pulse ribbons of headlights moving and crossconnecting
like blood through the veins of a body 
impressionistic even beautiful but what were hearing
is soulful trumpetbased music mellow and haunting the
modern classic  jazz sound of a wynton marsalis
putting a voice to our story as credits end we

                                            dissolve to


pov  ext freeway  night

now the music is gone sounds are muffled and vision
blurred we get the impression of urgent movement we
hear breathing there are voices shouts even screams
but muffled far away only the breathing is distinct
we come to realize it is our breathing and we are inside
someone looking out the man whose pov this is is on
the edge of consciousness and not far from death he
lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact

his vision goes in and out of clarity people are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles a siren blooms in the distance and
approaches haltingly the man slips away comes back
toward consciousness slips again

the crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer it is a woman officer sharon pogue
lapd she kneels at the mans side taking charge
speaking but we hear only slivers of sound he sees her
face clearly now close above him

sharon is   a dedicated professional and more we see down
into her   to a place of real caring she stares into our
eyes and   connects we begin to hear her now  and there
are more   sirens converging in bg

                          sharon
            can you hear me
                   shouting off
            this ones conscious!

                          voice os
            paramedics on the way!

we are slipping away again sharon holds us with her
eyes and she grips our hand

                                            continued

                                                          2

continued

                           sharon
             wait wait listen to me    can
             you feel that

she holds on tight     we see that our hand held in her
own is bloody

                           sharon
             thats my hand hold it    go on
              as hard as you can

we watch our hand gripping hers and as we hold on the
sights and sounds around us grow more clear

                           sharon
             its over and ive got you and
             youre safe youre safe now
             you got that dont let go
             dont let me go

but our eyes unlock from sharons and drift to a patch of
night sky her voice fades awawy our pov begins to
lift moving toward that sky as the blueblack night
begins to turn white we go into that white light and

                                                 dissolve to


ext los angeles cityscape  day

we pick out a police car from the traffic and follow
the beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
some very rough edges


int police car  day

officer sharon pogue is driving the car it is two years
since we saw her at the accident site her partner
robby lewis sips coffee and keeps one eye on the cad
monitor which lists all area police calls she slows
behind a car that is crawling along an old 60s car
driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
bench seat the cars engine is missing and smoking

                           sharon
             that car is older than they are

                           robby
             67 chevy impala

                           sharon
             thats what i said

                                                 continued

                                                       3

continued

                           robby
             needs a servicing

                             sharon
             dont we all

robby nearly spits his coffee laughing at what sharon
has said and trying not to choke sharon smiles shaking
her head

                           sharon
             get it together officer

as robby smiles sharon looks ahead at the young couple
who each have an arm around the other she is stroking
his neck he is making gentle circles in her hair
sharon watches this and for a moment her eyes reveal a
depth that may be loneliness but she quickly pushes her
thoughts away and hits the horn startling robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
on

                            robby
             jesus pogo! almost spilled my
             coffee again! you didnt like his
             hair or what

                        sharon
          i love elvis hair they were
          going two damn miles an hour

but robbys eyes have caught something on the monitor

                        robby
          lets roll to this  fight in
          progress

as robby secures that coffee cup sharon hits the siren
and speeds around the car in front of them


ext city street  day

at the same time a few blocks away an old frail man is
carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
him

walking behind this man is a younger man named catch
lambert an attractive man with some scarring on his
face his eyes deep down are haunted by something but
there is energy in his step he is dressed in a relaxed
and stylish manner not expensive he begins to pick up
his pace to catch up to the old man

                                             continued

                                                     4

continued

people glance at catch nad he glances back in an open
and unflinching way ready for anything a smile a nod
or  because these are some of las mean streets  a
threatening or taunting look these he also meets
openly without a trace of fear the man has been
through some kind of fire and it has left him different
from us outside the usual boundaries

catch walks beside the old man glancing at him
finally the man glances back wondering and suspicious
but catch has a slight disarming smile open and honest

                           catch
             yknow since were both walking
             the same way i could take one of
             those bags for you that way i
             do some upper body work while im
             walking along helps my back
             what dyou say

the old man trudges on proud and suspicious too

                           catch
             right now your minds making
             pictures of me robbing your
             groceires but yknow nine times
             out of ten people do the right
             thing

the old man glances at him still not convinced but he
soon has to stop and rest catch stops too the old
man looks at him a bit embarrassed

                           old man
             its the dog food that makes it so
             heavy

catch nods puts out his hand the old man hesitates
then decides and lifts a bag and catch takes it

                           catch
             i guess its worth it for a
             good dog

catch isnt kidding he has that honesty the old man
nods and starts trudging again as they walk on
together catch reaches for that second bag the man
relents and lets him take it they continue on catch
carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
bit for his upper body work

                                                          5

ext video game room  day

this is the call sharon and robby have sped to it is a
chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
boys 1620 a big kid 18 or so is being pulled off
another by sharon and robby the kid is wild and
resisting and sharon shows her toughness and
professionalism and some anger too as she slams him
into a fence  and robby holds him while she cuffs the
young man  who is very mouthy playing to his friends

                        kid
          look at this bitch    whoo!   benny
          look at this!

sharon and robby are both very good at their jobs taking
this kid to their car while other cops contain the rest
a crowd watches  mostly teens

                        kid
                 to sharon
          you come in with me    hey bitch

some of his bystanders friends howl at that

                        kid
          youre going to arrest me you
          come into the back seat with me

he resists a bit but theyre getting him into the car

                         kid
          come on   well have a good time


int police car  day few minutes later

sharons on the radio to dispatch as robby drives and the
kid keeps mouthing off

                        sharon
                 to radio

sharon is stonefaced through this

                                                continued

                                                           6

continued

                           kid
             if youre going to put me away
             you gotta give me one sweet touch


int jail booking area  day

as robby and sharon bring their suspect to the booking
counter each holding one of his cuffed arms the kid is
looking at sharons hand on his arm

                           kid
             that aint the touch   that aint
             the touch i want

they get him to the counter

                           robby
             as i remove your cuffs i want you
             to put your hands here spread
             your legs more

as they remove the cuffs the kid makes a sudden move
toward sharon reaching between her legs  but she was
not only ready for this but hoping for it  and the
stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
moves quickly and grabs the kid by the hair bringing his
face into her upraised knee he cries out and goes down
on his knees hurting and bleeding the jailer rushes
over to help but robby grabs the kids wrists

                            robby
             thats it   back off john we got
             it

robby glances at sharon  a dark glance


ext police jail parking lot  day later

as robby and sharon walk to their car they are
interrupted by one of their lieutenants sanderman
walking their way and stopping to stare at sharon she
meets his look

                           sanderman
             you trying to be a badass pogue

                           sharon

             the prisoner

                                                  continued

                                                          7

continued

                            sanderman
             and you dont see a pattern here
                    pause
             i want you to keep yourself way
             inside the line instead of walking
             on it all right are you taking
             notes

car  she is dark he is glancing at her

             longrange plans for his ass while
             he was mouthing off in the car 
             and youre supposed to be above

she starts the car and starts to back out and he reaches
over and turns off the ignition she stares hotly at
him  but then slowly she softens takes a deep
breath

                                              immediate cut to


int sharons apartment  night

she is on the floor using an exercise rig sliding into
crunches pushing herself sweating alone we begin
drifting to the rainspattered window as night sounds
filter in horns someone shouting a car moving by with
thunderous bass music that pulses the very air and
rattles the loose glass of her window


ext neighborhood streets  night

catch lambert is walking the wet streets head down in
the rain far away we hear that car with a bassblasting
radio

                                                 continued

                                                       9

continued

in the glow of a street lamp catch sees a brightcolored
object in the gutter he picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water it is a small toy a discarded superhero
he puts it in his pocket walks on

now the car the prowling musicblasting bass
thundering car turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly  beside catch he glances over walking on
there are four toughlooking men in the car looking for
trouble the music is deafening catch glances again
walks on their eyes follow him like gun barrels he
stops and walks out on the street moving toward the car
shouting over the music

                          catch
             hey! you want to turn that volume
             down whats your point

the men incredulous stop the car and snap off the music
in order to make sure theyre hearing right they stare
death at catch

                           driver man
             what did you say

                           catch
             whats the point of blasting your
             music through the whole zip code
             dont you realize there are kids
             trying to sleep in these
             apartments  old people sick
             people

they can hardly believe this

                           driver
             you better watch your mouth
             asshole

catch meets the mans look with his own unflinching
haunted eyes

                            catch
             why   whatre you gonna do   kill
             me

catchs look is not a macho challenge its something
else  beyond that a man somehow without limits one
of the riders in the backseat taps the drivers shoulder

                            man #2
             guys nuts   lets go

the driver never breaking his death stare snaps on the
deafening music and then slowly rolls on still glaring
at catch catch stands in the rain watching them go

                                                       10

int catchs apartment corridor  same night

catch is arriving home soaking wet he lives in a
slightlyseedy threestory as he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment he passes a neighbors
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock
he pauses  and then knocks softly on the door

someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door  a young single mother friendly but with a little
caution too she recognizes catch behind her is a
little boy five the womans name is candace her
son is tommy

                         candace
          hi

                         catch
          hi   your keys are in the

he gestures and she sees the keys and retrieves them
more friendly now

                        candace
          oh thank you thanks a lot
          god i was trying to carry tommy
          and all these bags he was so
          tired of course as soon as i
          put him down he had all this
          energy

while she is talking catch is staring deeply at the boy
who is shy catch almost speaks to the boy wants to
goes halfway to a smile  but the sight of the kid stirs
that layer of darkness in catch he nods a goodbye to
the mother and is about to go she thinks about this as
he is turning and pushes through her remaining caution
to say

                        candace
          yknow we were just baking
          nectarine bars because the peaches
          werent ripe ever had a
          nectarine bar

he smiles and seems to want to stay but he is already
retreating his contact goes only so far  and no
further

                         catch
          sorry   gotta be going

and with one more glance at the boy he walks to his
apartment unlocks it and steps in

                                                      11

int catchs apartment  night

he walks into a bare living room  no chairs tables
lamps nothing on the walls he walks into a spotless
neverused kitchen and flips on the light opens a
drawer

in the drawer is a collection of kids toys some found
some purchased mostly plastic figures the action of
opening the door has started some batteryoperated
animals moving around in there now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer

he walks back into the living room he sits on the
floor leans back against the wall his clothes still
soaked from the rain he stares at his thoughts looking
a bit numb  and lost

elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly     we see
her own depth of feeling

continues his work in silence

a booth of offduty cops out of uniform now including
ray sanchez sharon and a few more male officers

it and says

slide out of the booth

                                               continued

             man with a gun

                           catch

             brain

he looks at her steps close to her takes the drink out
of her hand puts it to his lips and drinks it all down
he puts the glass on the table

                           sharon
             whyd you do that

                            catch
             see   now youre thinking about
             me

she gets a half smile assessing him her look is
direct and the attraction is there he feels it too
and he deflects it nodding toward a large photomural of
snowcapped mountains

                             catch
          let me guess       colorado

                        sharon
          its austria but i cant picture
          myself in austria im not good
          with languages so i couldnt
          qualify for the departments over
          there

she rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
off her ankle she takes the cuffs off her belt the
mace from her jacket the shield from her shirt pocket
puts them all in a desk drawer she takes off her jacket
and throws it over a chair disarmed she turns to him
her look is all wanting and pushing away almost fierce
in her struggle he sees this

                           sharon
             thanks for coming up here

                           catch
             does that mean im going

                             sharon
                      flustered
             no    you dont have to    i

                              catch
             you okay now

                                                 continued

                                                     36

continued

her eyes grow a bit hard defensive

                             sharon
             oh    youre here as a medic

                           catch
             is this the mad part

she smiles in spite of herself  again he has gotten
to her she wants to fall into this guy but shes
pumping those brakes they are standing close together

                           sharon
             maybe going is a good idea

                           catch
             can i come back some time

                             sharon
             why

                           catch
                    shrugs
             must be the smell

that makes her laugh and her resistance falls away with
her surprised laughter and she puts her hands around the
back of his neck her touch is electric to him she is
going in for a kiss and he is retreating they stare a
moment  and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
lets loose his own longing it is a hungry and
passionate kiss and in the very midst of it he breaks
off and pulls back his darkness rushing at him she is
staring surprised and he is looking a bit shaken
getting the words out just above a whisper

                             catch
             i better go

she doesnt know what to say the moment hangs he
leaves once he closes the door the breath escapes her
and she shakes her head  feeling like an idiot she
lost control with a stranger

                             sharon
             oh god


ext street  night

catch leaving sharons building in a turmoil of emotions
staring hard at his thoughts  and he steps into the
path of a car the car screeches to a stop and the
scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
paralyze catch and he sees 

                                                         37

flashback  sliver of image

headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving


back to scene    present

this sliver of memory jolts him  and then another one
comes


flashback  headlights

coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory
and all of this is exploded 


back to scene    present

by the angry driver shouting at him


                        driver
          what the hell do you think youre
          doing!

catch is numb  completely shut down there in the middle
of the street the driver exits his car and comes toward
him raging

                        driver
          are you crazy!

catch isnt even aware of him the man gawks at this 
and now catch walks off it is raining the streets are
wet


angle  residential street  night

as catch continues his walk he is still a bit shaken 
but when he passes a parked car with the window half
open rain getting in he hesitates he cant just walk
on he looks about he tests the lock he opens the
door rolls up the window closes the door walks on

but a man is just exiting a doorway to the street  and
calls out

                           man
          hey!    hey!   what did you do

catch stops and turns in the rain     the man hurries
toward him upset angry

                                              continued

                                                               38

continued

                              man
             thats my car!     what the hell were
             you doing

                             catch
             nothing    i just

the man shoves him

                             man
             i saw you!    what did you take out
             of there!

                            catch
             no i rolled up the window       its
             rain

the man gets in his face shaky

                           man
             you take my phone!       hah!

he shoves catch again and catchs desperate confusion
explodes in a surprising reaction grabbing the mans
jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
slap slap slapping him saying

                              catch
             hey!   hey!    wake up!    wake up!

the man is now speechless frozen terrified as catchs
eyes hold him with a fierceness  and a sadness

                              catch
             i helped you
                    pause
             i helped you

catch lets him go and immediately begins walking away
hunching into the rain his expression dark and troubled
he gets five steps away and turns the man steps back 
but catch only says

                              catch
             im sorry

and he walks on        the man watches him go


int catchs apartment building corridor  next day

candace catchs neighbor is waiting for the slow
rattling elevator with her son

                                                      continued

                                                       39

the elevator door opens  and there is catch seated on
a newlybought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap other boxes nearby and a
longstemmed rose in his hand wrapped for giving

                             catch
             oh   sorry

he rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter

                             candace
             shopping day

gets his things into the hall  and he manages a special
look for tommy a wink he frees the elevator they step
inside as the door starts to close catchs face
follows the sliding door with a funny look for the boy
we hear tommy laugh as the door closes catch carries
his new possessions to his apartment

apartment tired after   her shift drained a bit   by her
visit home when she    reaches her door she sees   that a
longstemmed rose has   been maskingtaped to her   door
written on the masking   tape is catch lambert    and a
phone number

bed surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo
albums from her girlhood in a vase on her bed table is
catchs rose

sharon is feeling blue looking at her young self within
the family that has shut her out she closes the book
angry at herself for nearly crying she sits up and
catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and
pulls out the tape with catchs phone number on it

shes very conflicted    about this she puts the tape
down but it sticks to    her fingers she tears it off and
tries to throw it onto    the table but it hangsoff her
thumb she sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe
number

and she leaves the house and slams the door


int sharons apartment  night

she is just returning home after her shift very tired
drained she absently turns on the tv the stereo she
notices a blinking light on her message machine and hits
the button

                           larry vo

             and see how you like it

the message ends     she stands there a moment

                           sharon
                    quietly
             oh god oh shit

she sits on the edge of a chair worried deep in her
thoughts hitting bottom  the darkness engulfing her
in a moment she looks at her desk walks there opens a
drawer pulls out that piece of tape with catchs number
on it  but it is all stuck to itself she hesitates
then starts to pick it apart when a knock at the door
makes her jump she wonders then somehow she knows
she walks to the door

                                              continued

                                                           60

continued

                           sharon
             its you right

she unlocks   and opens the door stares at catch very
vulnerable   on the very edge her pain and fear over
larry just   under the surface catch holds a box of
cookies as   an offering

                            sharon
             can you just shut up    just shut
             up and listen

                           catch
             i didnt say anything

                           sharon
             i dont want to talk i dont
             care if you have to play some game
             and pretend youre a angel of
             mercy or whatever i dont
             care but i dont want to hear
             about it all right i dont
             want to hear anything

she steps back allowing him in and closes the door and
turns to him

                           sharon
             its a bad night

he sees her pain and puts his arms around her pushes
through his fear and holds her  and she lays her head
on his chest he embraces her fully and the effect on
him goes deep to his core where there is both pain and
longing but he holds on to her even rocks her a bit
she sighs in a moment

                           sharon
             this is good but im too tired
             to stand up anymore

he walks her to the couch and has her sit and then
slowly gently he disarms her he lifts her leg
takes the ankle holster and gun off puts it on the
table he turns her takes the cuffs off her belt from
the middle of her back he reaches into her pants pocket
and removes the mace from her shirt pocket he takes her
id shield he has her lie down on the couch now their
faces close eyes locked they linger

                           sharon
             you want to kiss me

                                                  continued

                                                       61

continued

he looks a little lost but he nods helpless he comes
toward her lips  finally  but just before they touch
she says softly

                           sharon
             kiss me someplace ive never been
             kissed

hes not sure what to do he begins to look her over 
as if hunting and she gets a soft smile he starts
slowly toward her ear  but she shakes her head her
shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare and he
starts to move there but checks her with a look she
shakes her head he hunts her smile deepens a bit he
takes her hand and turns it over going for the soft
flesh on the underside of her forearm and she closes her
eyes he kisses her there softly and then again and
then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside
of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her
knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them
to no he stops she looks at him a deep look soft
voice

                           sharon
             why do you stop you always stop

she has a glimpse of his mystery the old sorrow the
deep pain he hugs her drawnup knees closing his eyes
a moment then he sits on the couch puts a pillow on
his lap and raises her slightly lays her head on the
pillow he strokes her hair her scalp as she closes her
eyes and sighs slowly moving toward sleep our trumpet
music slides in here lush and dreamy as we linger a
while and then 

                                           slow dissolve to


int sharons apartment  morning

just after dawn catch has slept on the couch he is
beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the
windows the dreamy trumpet fades out catchs eyes
clear sleep replaced by thought and he is suddenly
shaken by 


flashback  catchs pov

 a sliver of memory but in this one he is driving
we see his hands on the wheel then his pov looks to the
side and we see an asianamerican woman seated beside
him attractive about his age her name is annie she
is saying something to him we dont hear the words
when the flashback ends 

                                                        62

back to scene present

catch sits up on the couch jolted   he gets another
sudden 


flashback  headlights

glaring through his windshield blinding him he gasps
sitting there on the couch but its all over he
stands rattled and he moves toward sharons bedroom


int bedroom  morning

sharon is peacefully asleep he stands over her with
troubled eyes but this slowly changes to a loving look
he bends close to her face he feels her breath on him
he wants to lie down with her  but he raises a hand and
very gently brushes her cheek she stirs he does it
again she sighs a peaceful sigh opens her eyes he
smiles at her

we start in the kitchen staring at the drawer that is
now so loaded with toys it wont shut some brightly
painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer

in the living room there are two chairs now and more
lamps and tables our pan reveals that the dog from the
alley is sitting in the living room watching catch 
whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall  a
mountain scene he holds the picture in one place then
moves it to another wondering his fight with sharon
still colors his mood but hes working through it

                           catch
             do we go for symmetry or
             more offcenter japanese

 and she snaps

                                                continued

looking at him finally she begins  with no emotion

                           sharon
             yesterday okay yesterday we
             rolled on a 415 juliette and
             sanchez had these four guys
             against a wall but they were
             hdb and definitely uncoop it
             got pretty jumpy but we got them
             in the car with a couple of
             bruises and robby got a sprained
             wrist so i did the rest of the
             shift with a rookie who lost it
             over a db in sunset park old
             woman whod been dead maybe six
             seven days and i usually do all
             right but the smell got to me and
             i can still smell her then we
             arrested a prostitute working out
             of her home and i carried her
             little girl out to the social
             worker and the kid was holding on
             real tight and making my shoulder
             wet and i wanted to punch her
             rockhead mother and then shift
             ended and i had a nice visit with
             my brother larry

                            catch
             no   no you can always tell me

she stares a moment then speaks with an irony he doesnt
pick up on

                           sharon
             well i feel better now    you
             feel better

he takes off his tshirt and begins stripping off his
shorts his underwear!

                           sharon
             what are you doing!

she is surprised smiling as he plunges into the pond
her darkness dissipating

                           sharon
             catch! theres no swimming here!
             and you cant be naked in a state
             park!

he dives under and surfaces again

                           catch
             take the day off pogo!

                           sharon
             what if a park ranger comes!

he dives and surfaces once more       we stay close on him

                           catch
             take your badge off for once
             dont be such a damn marine about
             everything just

he stops because she isnt there he looks about then
suddenly he sees her poised on a boulder right above
him in her underwear about to dive! he yelps and gets
out of her way and she dives off the rock in classic
nearprofessional form a beautiful sleek dive she
hits the water just right and surfaces and they splash
and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed
play

                                                 continued

                                                           76

continued

at one point she jumps at him to dunk him and he catches
her they are in chestdeep water and their faces are
close they pause  then she goes in for a kiss but he
pulls his head back avoiding that kiss and says

                           catch
             someplace ive never been kissed

she smiles staring then slowly reaches her hands to his
face gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
the closed lids but she changes her mind and instead
puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
face then she moves away he opens his eyes she
walks to the shore moves to her clothes and starts
getting dried and dressed giving him a soft look

catch comes to the shore    to dry himself but as he
dresses sharon glances    at his body  and the scarring
on his chest and arms     he is troubled about this
avoiding her eyes then     he makes a decision

                            catch
             they tell me i was in an accident
             long time ago

                           sharon
             looks like a bad one

                           catch
             i dont remember it    i

she waits  but he says no more she continues        to
dress sliding her shorts over her wet underwear        but
before she puts her shirt on she turns her back       to take
off her wet bra he glances at her she looks         over and
catches him glancing they both smile softly
ironically as they finish dressing

                           sharon
             we should be thinking about lunch
             we have to pack up

there beside robby and he stares at her as she grooves

attention in the parked car robby makes a gesture to
lower the volume and the man snaps off his tape robby
rolls on glancing at sharon she wears a small smile
checking their beat

scanning the dark buildings  but the sound is hard to
track a faint ballad on a skillful horn

screaming at each other robby shakes his head

                           robby

confront each other one big guy carries a baseball bat

for once she shares it

                                                    continued

                     pause
             they say i turned against the
             family

catch works in silence a while absorbing this looking
at sharon with more tenderness than ever in a moment

                           catch
             but they invited you

                           sharon

                           catch
             then you forgive

                           sharon

                                                 continued

                                                       84

continued

sharon is considering his words but shes also deep in
her old pain defensive challenging

                           sharon
             you close with your family

that hits him but he keeps rubbing her gentle now
looking a little lost he doesnt answer

                          sharon
          see    so why should i listen to
          you

but as he works her back in silence we see her facing
her pain and thinking through it


int sharons apartment  next morning

just after dawn catch is on the couch stirring in his
sleep in the grip of an unsettling dream we hear what
he hears the voices of his wife his son murmurings
were not sure of the words even laughter catchs eyes
snap open jolted out of sleep but the voices dont
stop and he suddenly sits up the voices fade as he
catches his breath gulping air he tries to calm down
in a moment he rises and moves to sharons bedroom


int bedroom  morning

he comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is
asleep he sits on the bed and studies her his dark
thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep his eyes
going deep in a moment he begins to raise a hand to
brush her cheek  the way awakened her before  but he
stops before touching her instead he brings his face
close to her and lightly kisses her

she stirs he kisses her again she opens her eyes
they stare at each other she raises a limp hand and
touches his face he begins to come close slowly for
another kiss she welcomes it they kiss on the mouth
very tenderly they kiss again  deeper they kiss
again and she holds him and he moves fully onto the
bed lying over her and supporting his weight on his
elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once
hungry for her because she is in his heart now and she
is a salvation and there is a moment when they both
pause and stare cleareyed acknowledging what they are
doing and both of them abandon their fear and pain and
begin to smile and they make love that way smiling as
we slowly

                                              dissolve to

                                                        85

int blues club  night

the night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody
place with a lot of downtoearth atmosphere and not a
lot of noise like harvells in santa monica  earthy
blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club small
dance floor we pan during this slow number and arrive
at a few dancing couples including sharon and catch who
mostly just hold each other and sway when their eyes
meet there is a lot of deep pleasure there

the music ends the small crowd applauds couples head
back to the tables but the little band goes right into a
more uptempo but still earthy blues sharon stops and
pulls catch back onto the dance floor he smiles and
follows

this number has a driving beat and slowly we watch
sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   free
out there and catch is smiling and wowed by her and   she
laughs wowing herself and she keeps going getting   wild
and playful and its something to see we linger on    the
joy and abandon shes earned it they go a little
crazy happy crazy and in a while we

                                              dissolve to


same  hours later

the blues club is emptying out its late the band is
finishing what seems to be its last number for the last
of thinning crowd  including a tired happy sharon and
catch who applaud the end of the number catch stares at
her

                        catch
          whats your favorite song

he rises  as if to go to the band with a request     she
smiles spent

                        sharon
          catch im beat so are they   i
          think theyre finished

                         catch
          one more   its a surprise

she watches as he leaves her walks to the bandstand     he
talks to the leader who is the piano player


sharons pov

from the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano
catch picks up a trumpet case opens it now sharons
tired smile is changing to curiosity wonder

                                                       86

on catch

as he puts the mouthpiece on the horn nervous but
excited too speaking to the piano player

                             catch
            thanks danny

                          danny piano player
            gonna be good having you back
            catch

catch comes to the edge of the bandstand grinning a bit
at sharon at his surprise for her nervously fingering
the horn he puts it to his lips


on sharon

mouthopen surprise  and then smiling with the wonder 
 and catch begins to play closing his eyes and
rendering a ballad like the haunting angel eyes

sharons smile slowly fades replaced by a much deeper
look not only because he is so good but because he is
showing her his heart his love and even his pain  more
than he can show her any other way we intercut as he
opens his eyes briefly watching her sending her the
music closing his eyes again to fall into the song  as
sharons eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it and
at this look inside her man we linger then

                                             dissolve to


ext club  night

we keep the sound of catchs trumpet going as he and
sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away arms
around each other in a moment he stops he cant go
another step he has to kiss her he holds her face and
comes in for the kiss and above the music we hear her
say softly

                          sharon
            where ive never been kissed

he stops and stares a moment then takes her hand and
walks her out into the middle of the trafficless
boulevard and there in the center of the street kisses
her and she responds and it is their finest fullest
moment lifting on the music and it is ironic and
prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
revolving light from a police car and a siren that chirps
once as they break staring

                                             continued

                                                        87

continued

                           sharon
             oh god

we widen to see ray and sanchez in their police unit 20
feet away ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to
say

                           ray
             are you in danger there

                           sharon
             go away

                           ray
             i was talking to him pogo

                        catch
          no thanks ray everythings code
          four go away

sharon laughs aloud and walks with catch in hand to the
police car her joy overwhelming any embarrassment she
gestures behind them at the jazz club

                        sharon
          see that place hes going to be
          playing there every weekend

catch notes the pride with which she says this

                        ray
                 impressed to catch
          oh yeah what dyou play

                        sharon
          its music ray you wouldnt
          like it

she waves and walks off with catch arms around each
other the cops watch them go

                                              dissolve to

                                                     88

continued

there is love in his look and then a passing question
too a residue of fear now that their relationship has
begun in full  but it all ends up in a soft smile for
her as he walks bob to the door he hesitates at the
door  then walks into the kitchen and slides open that
drawer of toys stares at them


int bedroom  morning minutes later

slips it on calling out softly for catch

catch nods grins at tommy who is already at play with
the figures


angle  sharon

distance she is angling toward the playground


on catch

he watches tommy at play with the figures but its
almost too much for him he touches the boy and rises
smiles and nods at candace and begins to walk off

                                                           90

                             candace
            excuse me!


on catch

but he is walking on some of the emotion seeping
through not darkness some old joy welling up we see
in bg tommy starts to run after him to say thanks we
now have a convergence of tommy sharon and catch who is
moving steadily toward the street crossing a bike path
now a biker is coming on all in one moment catch
hears the whizz of the bike tommy calling out thank
you and candace shouting be careful! and catch goes
cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike
path taking the collision with the bike so tommy is sure
to be safe catch and the biker fall hard sharon stops
 holding her breath tommy watches wideeyed and
candace comes running

catch is rising a little sore and soiled        the biker is
angry

                          biker
            goddammit  i saw the kid
            jesus i wasnt even close

but catch is walking     away with that frozen numb look
all shut down by his     fear and his memory as bob trots
along beside him and     the biker comes after him and tommy
and candace watch him     go and sharon hurries her steps to
catch up the biker      reaches catch first

                             biker
            wait a minute!     hey!

gets in front of him raging

                                              continued

                                                          91

continued

                           biker
             why the hell did you cause a
             wreck! i told you  i saw the
             kid you idiot i was

pain and darkness build in catchs eyes until he says in
a quiet choked voice right into the bikers face

                           catch
             one more word and your life will
             change forever

the man stops talking looking at the dead certainty in
catchs eyes he wants to say more to save face but
catchs look holds him like a fist sharon has stopped
frozen watching the biker turns away and walks back to
his downed bike as catch moves on sharon can hardly
believe all of this following catch again


on catch sharon

                               sharon
             catch!   catch!

it takes a moment for her voice to penetrate then he
quickly turns and sees her approaching

                           sharon
             are you all right your elbows
             bleeding i

but he is tight nearly frozen everything held in

                               sharon
             whats wrong

he walks away from her and this shakes her and she
catches up again

                           sharon
             where are you going catch 
             youre scaring me please

he turns and walks off heading for the street

                                                 continued

                                                               92

continued

                               sharon
             please   wait     i catch!

he has walked into traffic  not completely unmindful of
the cars but desperate to get away she watches this
frozen as horns blare he has to stop in the middle of
the street to wait a moment and he stands there
stricken


on catch

as the traffic moves around him and the dog  a horn
blares brakes screech and he thrown into a storm of


flashbacks

that come sharper and faster than before bits and pieces
of memory outside any order he is driving annie smiles
at him headlights blind him annie screams the little
boy in annies arms grins at him brakes scream annie
says something to him calmly but he cant hear her the
headlights blind him again and brakes scream again and


back to scene present

catch stands there shaken and shut down


on sharon

watching him shocked and frightened for him she sees
the traffic let up and catch crosses and walks toward
home she watches him go


ext busy street  day later

traffic in a moment they pull over and park beside an
office building it is the same building the man entered
shouting catch! sharon watches the buildings
entrance after a while

int catchs apartment  day

catch is at home still shaken by what happened to him in
the park he reaches for the phone punches in a number
it rings and elanora chu picks up catch is deep in his
pain

             a bus and a van where        on
             the freeway

something is pulling at her memory her vision turns
inward and she stops breathing for a moment 
remembering she was there and here we get a


flashback  carnage

a glimpse of the carnage  what she saw first on the
scene  with catch lying there all the while pindella
is speaking

                           pindella vo
             i think so yes near santa

             severely injured but thrown
             clear  the others were trapped in
             the van

                                                          98

continued

                            sharon
                     quietly
             yes   i was there i was there

pindella stares then

                           pindella
             his wifes mother survived but
             she was paralyzed

she takes a moment absorbing this

                            pindella
             elanora chu   shes still in town
             i believe

             he says he doesnt remember the
             accident

                           pindella
             he lost a lot of memory i tried
             to help him with that he
             resisted walked away

she stares

                           sharon
             i think he remembers me

very subdued now she asks

                           sharon
             how does he live

                        pindella

          from the city but hebarely
          touches it he was a professional
          musician

she stares at him and nods

                                                continued

                                                          99

continued

                          sharon
             trumpet

as he says that we hear our trumpet music begin  a
fast and furious muted trumpet incredible riffs and we
use this to carry us as we

                                                dissolve to


int police headquarters  day

sharon is in the report room using the computer
hunting we move around to see her and the screen she
is searching the police records to find the accident
the continuing trumpet riffs are the motor for this she
suddenly stops as we focus on the name lambert then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads

                                                dissolve to


int sharons apartment  night

we move through sharons nearly dark apartment its
stillness in strange contrast to the manic trumpet riffs
we pan to find her curled in a chair staring deeply
sadly drinking a drink as we pan we discover she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone punches in a number


int catchs bedroom  night

he is sitting on his bed back against the headboard
sitting there fully dressed shoes and all knees up 
as he plays his muted trumpet hard and fast playing the
incredible riffs weve been hearing playing in a driven
way keeping his demons away when the ring of the phone
breaks through he stops suddenly he waits his
machine clicks on and beeps we intercut the call as
sharons voice comes on subdued

                           sharon
             catch its me can you pick up

but he sits there waiting listening

                           sharon

continued

he sits there he slowly puts the horn down he reaches
for the phone now  but she hangs up before he picks up
the call

                                                 cut to


ext westwood street  corner  next day

catch waits on a busy street corner in westwood village
not far from santa monica he is waiting glancing over
the passing crowds for sharon he sees her she is off
duty out of uniform he watches her until she spots
him she smiles a little but there is a mix of fear and
sadness in her smile they walk to each other and stop
and hug but it is brief and then she keeps walking
slowly and he walks beside her there is a strain
lingering between them

                           catch
             shar im sorry about yesterday

             until you mentioned it you

somewhere he looks about beginning to show some
agitation but covering it

he slows his steps looking across the street and down
half a block


his pov

we see an ivycovered brick building there with a sign
that is too far away for us to read


on catch and sharon

he looks quickly away from that building       she sees his
growing agitation

                        sharon
          you can trust me you know

she takes his hand

                        sharon
          ive got you now im holding on
           like before

             like i held you before   like i
             did  at the accident

he suddenly pulls his hand out of hers shocked and it
shakes her

                                                 continued

                                                          102

continued

                           sharon
             what makes it so unspeakable
             catch what makes it like that

he begins to shut down to grow cold and numb and not
hear this

                           sharon
             is it because you were driving

he turns away closing his eyes

                           sharon
             i read the reports and it wasnt
             your fault it wasnt is it
             because you survived and they
             didnt

she puts her hand out for him again

                           sharon
             catch please hold on and
             well go in there together

he does not take her hand so she takes his and walks a
few steps toward that building

                           sharon
             you can talk to them you can say
             goodbye or i love you or
             whatever

he pulls his hand away again more violently a layer of
rage over his pain

                           catch
             this is wrong! its wrong!   why
             are you doing this!

                                                 continued

                                                          103

continued

scared and sorry for what he said he takes a few steps
after her wanting to call out and to stop her we see
him almost call to her he is coming apart watching
her needing her so much but unable to call out

he is shaky he takes a glance at that building then
away he stares after sharon  but shes out of sight
now he steels himself then looks across the street
again at that building

he is desperately afraid he stares at the building a
long while he begins to cross the street he makes
fists to keep from shaking he walks to the entrance

                        sharon
          how come its not working for you

there is a scattering of laughter  almost by rote  as
sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile
robby notices she just punches up the cad monitor all
business our trumpet music comes in aching now and
takes us into


int sharons apartment  night

she is exercising on the machine sliding into her
crunches fast and furious but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes and in a moment she just stops the
trumpet music keeps going on through this she looks
over at the phone


int catchs apartment  night

we pan over bobthedog watching something we see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about hearing
rustling and we arrive at catch seated on the floor
shuffling through a stack of sheet music driven looking
for something the phone rings he ignores it he is
opening up each chart of music shaking it out
searching

sharons voice comes on his machine almost hollow with
sorrow

                         sharon vo
          catch  can you pick up
                 pause
          will you call me

he keeps searching seeming to not even    listen the
machine clicks off he shakes the next     music chart and
something falls out he stares at this     piece of paper
picks it up slowly turns it over it     is a picture of
himself a man blowing a horn drawn in    crayon by a four
or fiveyearold catch stares at this     with a depth that
goes on forever as the music ends

                                                       107

ext street  next day

sharon and robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall
parking lot exiting their car no rush shes still
very downbeat as they walk from the car he keeps
glancing at her concerned for her

                         robby
          pogo

she puts up a hand to brush all the words away she
cant talk about it she pushes through it by doing the
work

                        sharon
          which store is it

                        robby
          the little market there they
          came through a back window last
          night mostly vandalism

they walk on but as sharon reaches the sidewalk a
little child three years old or so toddles out the door
of a shop a skateboarder is rattling along and sharon
makes a grab for the child taking his arm gently

                         sharon
          whoa

 and pulling him to safety as the skateboarder passes
by shouting

                         skater
          sorry!

and now the worried mother is emerging from the shop

                        worried mother
          oh god thank you billy!

she picks up her boy walks back into the shop sharon
stands there  as it all blooms inside of her rocks
her really this little act evoking catch who he is
what he said and what he means to her robby is a few
steps ahead waiting for her but she cant move yet
looking around her now at the people walking among the
shops and cafes she picks one she catches the eyes
she gives a brief smile the smile is answered shyly
kindly the person moves on

                         robby
          pogo

she doesnt move for a moment    then she turns to robby

                                             continued

cover in place over her emotions

                           sharon

             it why did you come here

             felt so close to me but

                           elanora
             is that what you think

                           sharon
             but now he probably hates me

in worry

                           sharon

             come back you know but he
             wouldnt even go in he screamed

             what made you take him there

                           sharon
             for the truth

                           elanora
             he knows the truth

                           sharon
             but he wont even say it or

                                                continued

                                                          111

             know how hard it is for me to go
             to the cemetery can you imagine

sharon is shaken by this realizing crumbling a bit as
mrs chu goes on

                           elanora
             thats where it stares you in the
             face  the loss and its too
             much sometimes

elanora takes a breath acknowledging how upset she is

                           elanora
             see im still finding my way
             through it and catch  it
             almost kills him to think about it
             or say it or drive a car or see
             the place where it happened or
             go by the cemetery

                           sharon
             i was trying to help him come
             back to some kind of life i

             i was scared i push so hard

elanora sighs looking at her and her anger drains away
studying sharons misery

                           elanora
             you were finding your way    what

sharon stares without much hope she puts out her hand
to touch elanoras to say goodbye elanora takes her
hand and holds on a moment staring into the girl with
strength sharon nods and walks off dark and sad
elanora watches her go

parents renewal of vows she is at the bottom  with
catch gone from her life  but she is doing her best to

sharon

sitting still in a chair holding the gift on her lap
looking at the clock nervous scared sad


ext street  day same day

catch is walking down a commercial street  no bobthe
dog no strolling gait he is focused deepeyed on a
mission of some kind our music continues over this and
on into


ext street  day

the music continues over sharon driving to the church
parking taking a deep breath exiting the car there is
no one else outside the church the ceremony has already
begun shes planned it that way she enters the church
as the music fades out


int church  day

as sharon comes in quietly the church is not full but
perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews watching the
ceremony at the altar the priest mr and mrs pogue
altar boys sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a
few back from the altar the slight disturbance of
people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to
glance over

                                           continued

one of them is kathy they trade a brief nervous nod
then kathy whispers to her husband

                           kathy
             she came

we see larry grow tense and angry

                           kathy
             dont say anything   think of your
             parents

larry doesnt look at sharon the little boy looking
fine in a tiny suit and tie and being bored leans to
look at his aunt

sharon and larry jr trade a look     she winks then
settles back in her pew watches


on altar

we get our first   look at sharons father carl pogue 62
standing beside   his wife a rather big stolid guy taken
with the moment   both he and his wife emotional over
this he wears    a hearing aid the priest is speaking


on sharon

watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and
the vows are renewed the priest reciting the rituals


ext street  day

the priests voice from the church plays over this scene
invoking the blessings saying the prayers of the mass as
we watch catch continuing his mission slowing his steps
now and pausing at the entrance to the welston memorial
chapel he hesitates we see the price hes paying and
the determination he walks through the gate


ext chapel grounds  day

he walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a
garden setting  all red brick and ivy fountains and
flowers he is fighting his way through this moving
closer to one of the buildings he is nearly alone on
the chapel grounds and as he reaches the sheltered wall
of this building he is alone

                                               continued

                                                       115

continued

this is a wall   of bronze vaults within the bricks and on
each vault is   a plaque  a name his breath shivers in
his body as he   struggles to lift his eyes slowly his
gaze comes to   rest on a name lambert

as he stares the priests voice from sharons church
fades out and we are left with silence catch is
shaky he takes a step closer to the wall to the name
to them  and he tries to speak but cant he tries
again  his voice intimate just above a whisper at
first

                            catch
             annie chet i dont want you
             to think i forgot about you its

each piece of it we see catch driving the van      his wife
annie beside him his son chet is in back with      his
grandparents elanora and her husband the boy      is a bit
whiny pouty

we intercut the flashback with 


catch

at the grave struggling through this

                          catch
            chet you werent feeling so
            good remember it was your
            birthday and you ate too much

we see   annie and catch both glance back toward chet and
we get   present sound in this flashback scene as catch and
annie   both say whats the matter hm aww and then
annie   looks out the window and turns to catch and  we
cut to   catch at the grave his eyes filling

                          catch
            and annie you said you
            said

in the flashback we see annie turn to him again and this
time we hear her say softly

                          annie
            slow down in the rain all right

we go to catch at the grave fighting tears

                          catch
            and i dont know if i slowed down
            i dont know i hope i did
            but i didnt always listen im
            sorry im really sorry

back in the flashback we see annie reach around as
elanora hands chet to her then were back at the grave
and intercutting so that we see catch speaking through
his tears and we also see this tender moment played out
in the van

                          catch
             you put him on your lap and
            he looked at me and i made a
            face remember i made you
            smile chet
                          more

                                                continued

continued

                           catch contd
             and then we all smiled and it was
             a great minute it was im
             really glad i found that
             minute no matter what

catch stares at the grave in tears as the rest of that
minute now plays out punishing him it lasts only about
three seconds a bus out of control headlights suddenly
glaring through the windshield catch turning the wheel
brakes screaming people screaming  and then its over
and catch has been battered by the memory and is
weeping but has not looked away he is still staring at
the name of his family and he is able to say in a
broken voice

                           catch
             i wont forget anymore     i love
             you

he steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque rests
it there we stay on this then in a moment we

                                                 dissolve to

the little boy and walks ahead with a look at larry at
sharon


on sharon and larry

they nod to a few passing guests then theyre alone
his nose is still bandaged but less so anger and
betrayal in his eyes

                           larry
             how did you have the guts to walk
             into a church after breaking your
             word

                           sharon

she stops herself catching her rush toward the old
anger she goes calmer deeper even sad

                          sharon
          here lar

she hands him something it is the polaroid photo he
looks at it surprised they lock eyes she speaks
softly

a bit a hello here and there she feels out of place

                                                continued

                                                         120

continued

though the home and yard are thick with people there is
some tension especially in the core group  all who
know about the estrangement of sharon now and then a
nervous glance from her mother is directed at sharon or
a hostile glance from larry

sharon passes the videographer who is pointing light
camera and microphone at the vanders  having them put
their good wishes on tape she smiles then looks over
and sees her father across the room he is alone she
steels herself and heads his way he makes eye contact
then averts his look she is approaching him about to
speak when he walks up to some friends and starts joking
with them leaving sharon hurt humiliated

her mother has seen this and comes to her speaking
quietly nervously

                           mother
             dont make him talk about
             anything today

                           sharon
             mom i was going to fix his tie
             his tie is crooked

she sighs pushing through her hurt to say

                           sharon
             it was a nice ceremony

                           mother

             happy

                           sharon
             thirtyfive years and still in
             love huh

her mothers look clouds a little nervous again

                           mother

                           sharon

                                                continued

                                                         121

continued

                           mother

             apologizing to you but i love

             i know

                           mother

             to him for loving you im the
             one in the middle im the only
             one in this family who knows how
             to forgive anybody

and she walks away sharons eyes follow her surprised
and thoughtful she watches her mother approach her
father and straighten his crooked tie then kathy is
moving toward sharon sharon turns to her and they both
speak quietly  at the same time

                           both
             you look great

then they smile sad smiles       kathy gestures to her face
the faded bruise

                           kathy
             tons of makeup on larry too

they smile wryly again

                           sharon

             couldnt stand him doing that to

they stare and sharon gives her a hug kathy returns it


on larry

his expression intact for the group hes in but we see a
flare of anger in his eyes

             break  and go home

in the hushed tension that follows a glass falls and
shatters and more people quiet down and stare sharon
looks at her glaring brother looks at her mother
nervously picking up the broken glass  no support
there angry and shaken she turns to the door

she walks to the door opens    it starts to leave starts
to close the door behind her    and she stops take takes a
breath battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt
and anger she looks at that     nearlyclosed door she
pushes it open and walks back    in

we see a surprised and angry look from larry a worried
look from her mother  but sharon is moving through the
crowd searching until she sees her father she heads
toward him he sees her and walks into the kitchen
avoiding her she follows him we see larry and his
mother exchange an anxious look  and then move toward
the kitchen

sharon enters waits others are leaving the kitchen
leaving her alone with her dad but he starts to follow
them

opens his arms  and they embrace and she holds on
tight eyes closed
                                           continued

                           catch
             why do you try so hard not to cry

she stares at him again her throat fills with tears
mouth is trembling a bit she starts quietly finally
with nothing held back  but this is not anger as much
as mourning

                              sharon
             its not fair

the tears come and she doesnt fight them emptying the
old old wound speaking through her weeping now the
first time weve seen her cry
