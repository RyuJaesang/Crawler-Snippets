           dean is tentative but goes along with her he starts slow
           but she eggs him to go faster he runs in circles picking up
           speed until he is in a breathless circular sprint he cant
           keep up with the centrifugal force

           dean does as hes told they both hold on for dear life the
           world spins in a frenzy the dread on deans face builds to
           insane laughter it is super fun cindy screams her hair
           snaps in her face then a look of sickness steals her smile
           away she wants it to stop which slowly it does she gets
           off first tries to walk but is too dizzy she just keeps
           falling to the ground dean crawls off the merrygo round on
           all fours laughing
