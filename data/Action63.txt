desk giving douglas an eyeful
                          daria

          any of those boring people upstairs
douglas is unaffected   just looks at her blankly
                         douglas

as su stands aside giving fait a clear path out

ext street near christophes  night
fait slides into his porsche and drives off

int/ext faits porsche  night
faits checking his rearview mirror sees a black cadillac
escalade pull away from the curb and follow
fait doesnt need it
                           fait
             oh man
hes about    to punch it when a cop car turns a corner
and falls    in beside him fait throttles back keeps
driving     until finally the cops turn off and now
fait hits    it until
traffic ahead forces fait to turn into an alley in a semi
industrial area behind him the escalade tries to follow
but is cut off by the oncoming cars
we stay with fait he guns down the alley reaches an
intersecting alley turns guns it out of sight

                                                               30
int/ext escalade  continuous action
finally forcing its way through oncoming traffic and
speeding down the alley after fait the escalade reaches the
intersection turns and crashes into a dumpster rolled
into its path the dumpster forces the escalade into a
wall

ext alley semiindustrial area  continuous action
two men start to get out of the escalade we recognize
them lings two thugs we barely have time to realize
that faits escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley hes had no choice but to turn
and fight

which is what he does rushing the passenger
the battles ferocious and fast ultimately faits out
muscled and outgunned hes forced back against the open
door of the escalade guns to his head
                        ling thug #1

          then youre gonna tell us where they
          are
whereupon a
bottle
spins through the air the bottle knocks the gun from one
killers hand the gun skids under a nearby chainlink
fence
reveal
the person who threw the bar   su the fights on   two on

                                                            31
two using all means available during the battle a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chainlink fence almost
gets it when
two vicious dobermans guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence leap out of nowhere snarling and snapping and
smash into the fence the killer jumps back barely
escaping with his arm
the fight continues   fait and su wear them down
behind the fence the dobies want flesh every time someone
crashes into the fence theyre right there trying to get a
piece
also every time someone crashes into the old fence we see
a series of chainlink connections loosen and break until
it happens one too many times the entire fence goes down
the dogs are out the nearest targets su and faitsu and
fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs
finally su kicks one dog flying whipkicks the other off
fait the two men run for the escalade the dogs are up in a
flash su spots an abandoned car a rear door is open
                        su
          over here
fait follows right on his heels
the dogs close in
su reaches the car dives through the open door
somersaults over the rear seat kicks open the far door and
rolls out fait dives in right behind him the dobies leap
in after fait
faits airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car clears the door and su slams
the door shut
we watch a twodoberman pileup against the suddenly closed
door as su leaps to the cars other side and shuts that
door too trapping the snarling foaming dogs inside
the bad guys are gone and faits cell phone is ringing as
fait digs out the phone to su 
                        fait
          man what the hells up with these
          fucking stones

a talisman connecting her to her father not making the
fear go away but giving her strength

hazy with smoke loud with betting cheers and boos
a large chainlink cage stands at the center of the room
inside two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the

plastic    over their laps whenever a hard kick or punch
lands    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
shield    themselves from flying blood

quietly beats chambers like a drum chambers knows when its
finally tentfolding time croaks surrender through the

          in its present state its completely
          inert zero radiation zero
          volatility
whereupon ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
table folds the velvet over then whack hits it hard
with a mallet
he unfolds the velvet   the stones smashed to pieces
ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to russell who
places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule then
inserts the capsule into his contraption
                         russell
          goggles on
everyone puts on goggles then russell hits the switch and
the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
of stone which begins to glow

stones when su is there blocking the way sona
attacks su easily blocks the counters knocking sona back
never taking his eyes off ling when
sona whos fallen back against a buyers bodyguard quickly
takes the bodyguards small fullauto scorpion and turns
the gun on su
su dives for cover as the burst shreds the area where hed
just been standing as sona continues hunting su su sees

                                                              90

inevitable when

and now its daria vs sona
sonas a better fighter but darias got passion on her
side its a good fight until at last sona finds the
scorpion she swings it up and
daria executes a sudden improvised double move that strikes
sonas arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
scorpion at herself just as she fires the burst rips
through her chest and kills her

a length of nylon rope
fait turns to vanessa

                                                            93

fait jumps to his feet swinging the chocks not quite
like nunchakus more like a medieval mace and now all of
faits fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of charles charles tries to fight

the punishing blows land like thors hammer until
a mighty swing nearly takes charles head off charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground fait stands over
charles tosses the chocks down

for the wheelchairbound french buyer being helped by a
bodyguard
ling intercepts them knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the frenchmans chair then jumps into the agusta

as
behind him having clanked out of the hangar the abrams
tank is stopped the turret swivels toward the agusta

                          archie
            what do i know

int agusta  cockpit
the pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
crashing

ext airfield
the outofcontrol agusta swings back toward su and the
hangar losing altitude then smashes into the tarmac
ripping open the fuel tank spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large skidding circle
around su before crashing into another chopper and bursting
into flames
the spilled fuel ignites    a circle of intense fire   with
su in the middle
the agusta pilot still alive has been thrown outside the
circle but lings only path of escape takes him inside
into the circle he emerges with the bag of stones
su is waiting
                          ling

                                                          96
          you were lucky last time   you
          wont be lucky again
the final fight begins
the two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire
using everything they can lay their hands on each the
equal of the other each knowing its a fight to the death
for a long time the fight could go either way until
ling gets an arm around sus neck like charles su thrashes
and flails like charles he cant get away
                        ling
          ill kill you fast    you wont
          feel a thing

                          su
           i wont    you will
what happens next happens in an instant
su breaks the hold hooks one of lings arms   wrenches it
a direction it cant go
lings arm bones snap tissues rip
ling screams in pain just as su pulls the ceramic
capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
lings pocket and
slams the capsule deep into lings open mouth ling gags
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat his horror
stricken eyes meet sus su lets him suffer another moment
then in subtitled chinese 
                        su
          this is for our friends
and su strikes him in the throat a spearing openhand
blow with his fingertips hard hard enough that

inside lings throat
the ceramic capsule shatters releasing the hot glowing
white sliver of stone into lings windpipe the fragments
super highenergy radiation instantly beginning to cook
lings body from within the power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once
lings bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as

angle back on ling

                                                             97

as light beaming from his eyes and mouth ling flashcooks
from the inside out
not simply burned horribly desiccated his seared and
darkened skin shrinkwrapped mummylike around his
skeleton human jerky
in a moment its finished lings dryroasted remains
topple over su has closed a chapter
