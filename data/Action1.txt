          we listen to the immortal music of mozarts adagio of the
          clarinet concerto in a

          space infinite and empty
          
          but then slowly all nine planets of our solar system move
          into frame and align
          
          the last of them is the giant burning sphere of the sun
          
          just as the sun enters frame a solar storm of gigantic
          proportion unfolds the eruptions shoot thousands of miles
          into the blackness of space

          drumming sounds of the monsoon rain prof frederic west 66
          listens to the music
          
          an indian boy playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
          ship across a puddle
          
          the professor turns to his driver pointing to the boy

                       watch out!
          
          but its too late the jeep drives straight through the
          puddle at full speed sinking the boys toy ship
          
          in the background the jeep stops in front of a building the
          driver jumps out leading the professor towards its entrance

          an endless mine shaft an old elevator cage comes to a
          grinding halt when prof west steps out we see that he is
          accompanied now by a nervous dr satnam tsurutani 32
          
                                       prof west

          for this science lab
          
                                     prof west
                    helmsley told me that the neutrino
                    count doubled during the last sun
                    eruptions
          
                                     satnam
                    correct sir but that is not what
                    worries me
          
          they enter a large room with low hanging ceilings a small
          group of white coats look up from their computers which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier
          
                                     satnam contd
                    there was a new solar storm so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe
          
                                       prof west
                    how can that be
          
                                     satnam
                    we dont know professor sir
          
          satnam walks over into another room there he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises

                    the neutrinos suddenly act like
                    microwaves
          
          prof west slowly steps closer when he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling his face goes pale

          through the binoculars we see jackson and his kids arrested
          and led over a ridge
          
          with this we reveal an enormous research facility with
          hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling
          tower

                    they think its not such a good idea to
                    climb over their fences they feel the
                    area is unstable

                    activity in southern california which
                    is very rare

          int kates house/los angeles  morning
          
          kate slams the phone down lilly stops eating
          
                                     lilly

                    darling
          
          on the tv the interview comes to an end
          
          
                                                              continued

                                     governor
                     it looks to me like the worst is
                    over
          
          that moment a massive quake hits los angeles
          
          everybody dives under the table
          
          on tv the news casters and the governor do the same a few
          seconds later the signal cuts out
          
          gordon pulls kate and the kids close as the earth shakes
          violently for 20 seconds
          
          
          ext kates house/los angeles  morning
          
          jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house
          
          
          int kates house/los angeles  morning
          
          when he enters lilly immediately runs into his arms the
          next tremor hits cracks form on the kitchen floor
          
                                     jackson
                    we have to leave! noah lets go!

                    noah now! kate please
          
          the whole house rides up and down like on a wave
          
                                     gordon
                    i think hes right
          
          finally kate pushes her son out from under the table they
          all scramble out of the house in a panic kate is cut on the
          shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices
          
          
          ext kates house/los angeles  morning
          
          as they storm out of their front door the house crumbles
          behind them
          
                                      jackson
                    get in the car!
          
          the whole street starts to buckle left and right the houses
          are shaken and smashed like toys
          
          
                                                              continued
          
                                                                      38
          
          just before the wave of destruction can reach them jackson
          tears out of the driveway
          
          
          ext streets/los angeles  morning
          
          jackson maneuvers the limo through the crumbling
          neighborhood right in front of their eyes streets
          disappear trees fall electrical lines snap sewer pipes
          burst in front of the car
          
                                     noah
                    holy shit!
          
          jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers
          
          
          ext santa monica airport/los angeles  morning
          
          the limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac coming to a
          stop in front of a twin engine cessna
          
                                     jackson
                    damn it! wheres the pilot
          
          kate turns to gordon
          
                                     kate
                    gordon you know how to fly

                                     jackson
                    did you cover taking off
          
                                     gordon

                                     jackson
                    thats good enough for me
          
          they start running when jackson remembers something and
          heads back to the limo
          
          he grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his
          laptop back inside it kate shouts
          
                                     kate os
                    jackson what are you doing
          
                                     jackson
                    im coming
          
          he jumps out of the car and races back after them behind
          jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate
                                                             continued

          in the distance
          
          a gigantic fissure forms in the earth shooting towards santa
          monica airport
          
          gordon fumbles with the controls jackson yells from the
          copilot seat
          
                                     jackson contd
                    come on come on
          
                                     gordon
                            pointing at the
                             instruments
                    but im supposed to check all these
                    first
          
          jackson reaches over and slams gordons hand down and the
          plane lurches forward
          
          as the cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes
          down and explodes
          
          noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them
          
                                       noah
                    guys behind us!
          
          as the plane accelerates the giant crack closes in on them
          gordons hand trembles on the throttle control everybody
          screams on top of each other
          
                                     everybody
                    gordon! damn it! lift off!
          
          gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever the plane
          almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them
          gives way
          
          they hover for a moment almost caught in midair as the
          widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the
          bowels of the earth gordon fights to maintain control but
          they begin to be pulled down
          
          the daylight vanishes debris and mud smashes into the plane
          from all sides the canyon walls erupt
          
                                     gordon
                    i cant get it up!
          
          taking desperate measures gordon nearly rips the control
          stick out of its joint  with a lurch the cessna lifts out of
          the abyss
          
          
          
                                                            continued

          they all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are
          flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown los
          angeles!
          
          like a roller coaster gordon manages to weave the little
          plane through the tumbling high rises
          
          they dive one last time to evade the plummeting us bank
          tower the tallest building on the west coast
          
          all are dead silent as they watch the whole of los angeles
          crumble beneath them kate covers lillys eyes
          
                                     noah
                            in total shock
                    that was amazing gordon!
          
          jackson looks at kate and notices her cut
          
                                    jackson
                    are you okay

          the plane veers off in a northeasterly direction behind them
          the destruction of los angeles continues

          in that instant the air around them vanishes as if sucked
          from the landscape into a vacuum
          
          the biggest explosion the world has ever seen at least in
          the last 640000 years
          
          to them all this occurs in total silence the sound of the
          eruption has not reached them yet

          charlie slowly tries to stand again silhouetted against the
          cloud of dust and fire towering above him
          
          flaming rocks fly towards him when they hit the ground they
          detonate like fire bombs

          rocks plummet like comets around the rv as jackson races over
          a collapsing bridge on the radio in his delirious state
          charlie begins to sing

                    this is the end my friend
          
          yellowstone looks like a war zone the rv dodges the

          huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at charlie through

          the radio cuts out the forest and the camp grounds are mown
          flat by the extreme force of the ash cloud in the rear view
          mirror jackson sees it gaining on them
          
                                    jackson
                    lilly! down!
          
          a firebomb hits the rv ripping half the roof off
          
          lilly barely makes it under the dashboard

          ext empty army base/yellowstone national park  day
          
          at the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms
          cutting the rv off from reaching the plane
          
          lilly sticks out her head
          
                                       lilly
                    mommy!
          
          jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack sending lilly
          flying out without thinking he lets go of the wheel
          lunging after her and pulling her back inside
          
                                     jackson
                    stay down darling
          
          jackson races the rv alongside the forming crack
          
          spotting a narrow point in the crevasse he makes a decision
          slamming the accelerator down he races towards it at full
          speed
          
          moments later the rv is airborne!
          
          kate watches too shocked to scream a few drawn out seconds
          
          then the rv touches down crashing 200 feet from the plane
          
          kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper lilly jumps
          out racing into her moms arms jackson turns and sees the
          cloud approaching

          kate pulls lilly back to the plane
          
          jackson jumps into the back of the rv scavenging through the
          shelves looking for charlies map
          
          kate lifts lilly onto the wing of the plane gordon revs up
          the engines
          
                                     noah

          fiery rocks rain from the sky detonating to the right and
          left of their plane as kate climbs in

          back in the rv jackson is frantically going through the
          masses of books and papers on the shelves finally a map he
          unfolds it but its only of the london underground system
          
          he throws it to the ground and finds another this time hes
          lucky! there are markings everywhere
          
          as he races to the door the ground gives way beneath the rv
          kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight

                    jackson! no!
          
          noah begins to cry and lilly clings to her mom gordon just
          stares paralyzed
          
          the ash cloud is almost upon them!
          
          gordon takes action and accelerates the plane
          
          kate turns back a hand emerges from the crevasse then
          another holding a map her face lights up
          
                                      lilly
                    its daddy!
          
          jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them the map in
          his hand
          
                                      kate
                    jackson! here!
          
          kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him
          
                                                            continued

                    almost out of runway
          
          using every last ounce of energy jackson leaps onto the wing
          and is yanked into the plane by kate
          
          just at that moment the plane lifts off
          
          jackson falls into the cockpit completely out of breath
          lilly crawls over and hugs him
          
                                     jackson
                    thanks for waiting guys
          
          now all eyes are glued to the speedometer 180 190
          
          the violent ash cloud is hitting their tail rudder the plane
          swerves wildly! gordon gets it back under control
          
          the speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the cloud
          slowly falls back everybody breathes a sigh of relief
          
                                     kate
                    so now that you got your map where

          clutter the map in the left corner he discovers a large
          letter c followed by h  i  n  a

                                     sally
                    he said he wanted to spend a few

                    the whole north american continent is
                    about to perish and wilson decides to
                    go to church!
          
          adrian shoots an angry look at anheuser
          
                                     adrian
                    hes praying sir which considering the

          president wilson stays with his head bowed
          
                                     president wilson
                    now matter how idealistic you are
                    taking office you lose your innocence
                    behind that desk
                            pause
                    laura was right people have died
                    because of the decisions i made

                    thats not your fault sir
          
          he turns to face adrian
          
                                     president wilson
                    you sound like anheuser
          
          this quietly affects adrian
          
                                     president wilson contd
                    lauras never looked at me like that
                    before only once when i told her

                                     president wilson
                    you know what she said to me that night
                    we brought her to the hospital
                            pause
                    tommy i think you should do a
                    lottery every one should have a chance
                    to go thats what dorothy said to me
                    thats what we should have done
          
                                     adrian
                    there would have been chaos sir
          
          president wilson looks adrian in the eyes
          
                                     president wilson
                    you know what i believe adrian i
                    believe nature should choose for
                    itself from itself
          
          adrian takes this in

          a tense moment before adrian starts to walk away just as he
          exits the chapel wilson calls after him

          the canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead and
          behind them the volcanic cloud bears down

          shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces

          the antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off
          on the horizon the runway is way too short
          
          and to make matters worse the ground begins to move again
          slowly arching the tarmac upwards creating a crooked ramp at
          the end of it

          back the wheel
          
          gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts
          off veering sideways

          the antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling
          casino towers along the other side of the rim

          very slowly the plane starts to rise and sashas face lights
          up they barely make it over a casino called paris las
          vegas
          
          but the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure
          right behind it ripping away part of the landing gear

          the antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury
          cars out of the back cargo hold they barrel past the bentley
          like skittles narrowly missing it as they fly off in
          opposite directions
          
          the plane skids across the glacier clipping its wing and
          causing the aircraft to break apart
          
          sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he
          shoots towards the ledge in the antonov plunging into the
          deep

          the bentley is half buried we hear caesar barking

          these flying machines
          
          one of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet
          and lands near the bentley
          
          armed soldiers jump out their commander speaks to them in a
          sharp tone

          the camera follows the choppers revealing
          
          nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories
          built into the face of a mountain

          in front of every gate there is a line of huge y shaped
          metal support structures which are the launching towers for
          the ships they are each at least 800 feet high its an

          yard built into the hollow belly of the mountains
          
          nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other
          their size is at least four times that of the freedom of the
          seas however they look more like spaceships than anything
          having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force
          of nature
          
          but only three of these monstrous arks are complete number 4
          is being repaired all the others are still under
          construction surrounded by scaffolding

          they watch as massive stern gates begin to close yuri jumps
          up and yells to the others

          grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates all the
          other passengers surge forward with him
          
          in the distance on the bow side of the ships the huge
          mountain gates of the bay open revealing a stunning view of

                    we have to stop it!
          
          lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts
          to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall
          
          as it digs deeper into the metal the hydraulic starts to
          slow down

          jackson manages to catch his fall but in the process lins
          foot gets caught between the gears mangling it
          
          he screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a
          halt

                    i was so worried about you
          
          suddenly the zoological bay begins to seal itself off
          
          lilly already in the next compartment with tamara and her
          dog screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up from
          the floor to the ceiling it separates lilly from her family
          
                                       lilly
                    mummy!
          
          jackson and kate turn but its too late they only catch a
          glimpse of lilly before they are sealed in the water level
          continues to rise
          
          
          int antechamber zoological bay/american ship  day
          
          panicked tamara turns and looks around down the corridor
          in the distance she sees adrian laura and the rescue crew
          approaching
          
          but between them she spots the next chamber door rising
          quickly
          
                                       tamara
                    lilly run!
          
          lilly starts moving as tamara turns and picks up caesar
          
          moving quickly lilly is able to climb up and over the fast
          rising door but as she dangles from the other side she
          looks down and is too scared to jump
          
                                       tamara os contd
                    lilly! take him
          
          lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold caesar
          above the quickly narrowing gap
          
          in a courageous move lilly grabs the little dog before he
          gets crushed and together they fall to the ground
          
          
                                                               continued

          back on the other side of the chamber door tamara looks
          around she is trapped now as the water continues to rush in

          in the debrisfilled murky waters we see that the fuselage
          of air force one has slammed against the first of the ships
          launch towers
          
          slowly it begins to bend finally giving way the other
          launch towers follow like dominos
          
          the ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting
          sideways rudderless

          the giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless  smashed
          around by the debris and raging waters
          
          but then as it hits another ridge it rolls right side up
          and seems to steady itself
          
          however the strong currents continue to force it through the
          mountain ranges of the himalayas

          the water level in tamaras compartment is at its height now
          and she goes under
          
          she struggles below the surface for a moment looking around
          desperately for a way out but there is none

          jackson manages to find an air pocket he fills up his lungs
          with air and thinks hard
          
          as he strips off his jacket he seems to have a plan he
          dives under again
          
                                                                   120

          it tight lin screams
          
          noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater unnoticed
          to go and help his father

          power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet
          
          jackson opens it retrieving a giant crowbar he begins to
          use it to dislodge the tool but its hard work

          air now but despite this kate still tends to lin
          
          after a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified
          to see that noah is nowhere to be found
          
                                       kate

          the drill
          
          to his surprise a pair of young hands join his on the handle
          of the crowbar noah is alongside him now helping
          
          working as father and son they manage little by little to
          loosen it before finally the drill comes free
          
          adrian gives noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the
          surface jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he
          spots the knapsack containing his laptop
          
          he dives back down for it
          
                                                                      121

                    mom we did it!
          
          kate pulls him to her relieved he is safe noah smiles and
          calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker

          jackson reaches his knapsack but when sees noahs cell phone
          lying next to it he makes a decision and reaches for that
          instead
          
          he hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles but as
          he turns to swim back his face freezes
          
          hes looking into the lifeless eyes of gordon who floats
          inches from his face

                    i wonder will the clouds look the same
                    and the stars
          
                                     mrpang
                    do not fear some things will never
                    change
          
          the old chinese man forces a little smile closer to the
          front of this crowd jackson approaches noah
          
                                     jackson
                    i thought you might want this
          
          he takes noahs cell phone from his pocket and hands it to
          him
          
                                     noah
                    do you think ill still get a signal
                     dad
          
          jackson is touched to hear him use that word he smiles and
          hugs him adrian laura and anheuser arrive alongside them
          
                                     adrian
                    i finally finished your book jackson

                    person who ever got to the end
          
          jackson looks at her smiling playfully
          
                                     jackson
                    excuse me i believe hes addressing
                    the author well what did you think
          
          adrian smiles
          
                                     adrian
                    id say those astronauts of yours
                    would be shitting themselves if they
                    knew all their relatives are now stuck
                    in the south pole
          
          suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a
          burst of pressurised air a murmur goes through the crowd
          
          everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to
          roll back and light streams in
          
          
                                                             continued
          
                                                                     129
          
          the pang family try to see over peoples heads even anheuser
          looks hopeful jackson pulls his family close as the first
          rays of daylight hit their faces
          
          
          ext american ship/somewhere in the himalayas  day
          
          hatches unseal all around the ship sun streams through the
          clouds everywhere people emerge outside into the light of
          day a majestic moment
          
          
          ext front deck/american ship  day
          
          they all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice
          covered mountain peaks caesar lets out a yelp of joy
          
          almost as soon as the doors have opened the ships
          helicopters take off flying towards a stunning site
          
          the freedom of the seas is perched on a mountain peak
          surrounded by calm waters behind it they see the most
          beautiful rainbow this is the new world
          
          and again we hear mozarts adagio
          
          
          
                                       the end
