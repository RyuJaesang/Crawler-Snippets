           a bit monotone 
           thank you mrs thompson 
           welcome class of 2011 
                          a beat 
           i wasnt really sure what i wanted 
           to talk about today mrs 
           thompson said it might be good to 
           talk about growing up and getting 
           older and stuff so i guess ill 
           talk about that 
                         
           cal watches concerned wheres his son 
                         
                          robbie 
           i grew up a lot this year i 
           think i used to think that 
           growing up meant really growing 
           like getting taller and bigger 
           but now i think that growing up 
           just makes you smaller your 
           dreams get smaller and what you 
           want gets smaller 
           beat then 
           i grew an inch and a half this 
           year but i feel a lot smaller 
                         
           cal sits forward getting increasingly concerned 
                         
                          robbie 
           i was in love and i know that 
           makes parents laugh because im 
           only thirteen but whatever i was 
                          more

           i believed that there was one true 
           love for everyone and if you 
           fought for that person your one 
           true love would always work out 
           but thats not how it works it 
           sounded good when i was younger 
           but its just not how it works 
           theres no such thing as one true 
           love for everyo

                          cal 
           in fairness i dont know where he 
           was going but i think we can all 
           agree it was heading in a pretty 
           depressing direction and i 
           basically wrote it for him i 
           mean i didnt literally write it 
           but i sure as hell influenced it 
           and the kids already a spitting 
           image of his mother and ill be 
           damned if this is what hes going 
           to get from me 
                         
           people squirm uncomfortable this is a train wreck 
                         
                          cal 
           my son  not him my actual son  
           he believes in grand romantic 
           gestures he believes that people 
           have soulmates and we always 
           want to tell our thirteenyear 
           olds that theyre wrong that one 
           day youll understand young man 
           but maybe it should be the other 
           way around 
                         
           he looks at tracy out in the crowd 
                         
                          cal
