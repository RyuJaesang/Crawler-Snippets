	jack aint exactly cary grant but any guy wearing

	allnight liquor store he breaks the seal before
	he hits the sidewalk and moves on drinking as he
	goes  finally he comes to a nice downtown hotel  
	slipping the bottle in his coat he squints up at
	the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent

	frank just stands there bottled up with
	exasperation

				jack
			continuing
		careful frank  when you get angry your
		tie starts to spin


	jack steps into the lounge and frank shaking his
	head follows  as they move away a cardboard
	standup is revealed  on it are two 8 x 10 glossies
	of frank and jack and below printed in bold letters
	this tonight!  the doubly delightful tones of the
	fabulous baker boys!

	baker brothers

	as they make their way through the dimlylit lounge
	and settle behind matching pianos it becomes apparent
	that what the fabulous baker boys are in fact is a
	poor mans version of ferrante and teicher

	wider angle including lounge

	as they begin to plink out their theme song tables
	of middleaged couples sipping enormous banana
	daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads
	after a few bars the boys finish with a flourish and
	the couples applaud

				frank
			mr  smile

		to the starfire lounge  my name is frank baker
		and eightyeight keys across from me is my
		little brother jack

	at this point jack begins to mimic his brothers words

				frank
			continuing
		 theres one place thats always been for us
		a very special place and that place is this
		place the starfire lounge

	jack lays in a few soft bass chords

				frank
			continuing

	at which point franks hands descend onto the keyboard
	and give birth to the melody of  what else  people

	int  office

	frank stands across the desk from a young man who
	despite his youth has an irritatingly paternal
	attitude toward the two men in his office  jack stays
	in the doorway smoking a cigarette as if to venture
	any further is to risk contracting some hideous
	disease

				lloyd

	like a pit bull eyeing a steak

	lloyd doesnt answer  he just looks at jack smiling
	with amusement


	ext  street  jack and frank

	jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
	soup bone dogged by frank whos got the cardboard

	frank closes the trunk and moves to the drivers side

				frank
			continuinglike a litany
		you want a ride jack  no frank
		ill walk  okay jack good night
		good night frank

	frank turns the engine over and pulls away from the curb
	jack watches the taillights burn into the distance
	then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads
	for home

	angle  apartment building

	jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
	building where a black labrador is studying him from
	a second story window


	int  jacks apartment

	jacks apartment is small old and comfortably
	cluttered  the most striking item is a vintage phone
	booth placed against the wall  as jack lets himself in
	eddie the dog from the window walks over  he is not
	an overly enthusiastic dog but you can see from his
	face that he has a great deal of affection for jack

				jack
		hi pal  thought you were gonna clean the
		apartment

	eddie nuzzles the soup bone  jack unwraps the paper
	and hands it over

				jack
			continuing
		take it easy will ya  youre becoming a regular
		johhny appleseed the way youre dropping teeth
		around here

	jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
	to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs  
	he lifts the records back up the post and clicks on the
	machine  as bill evans smoky peace piece fills the
	tiny apartment jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
	walks over to the old piano near the window  settling
	back with the bottle of whiskey jack rests his elbows
	gently on the keys and stares out the open window
	listening to the music


	int  piano store

	jack and frank work opposite sides of a large piano
	showroom inspecting rentals of every style and color
	willie the owner of the place leans against a cheap
	upright contemplating his shoes

				frank
		what happened to the two clays willie

	frank frowns and glances around
	across the room jack pauses before another piano

	frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with
	his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony

				frank

	frank moves to another piano and repeats the process
	watching jack for a verdict
	after a moment jack nods

				frank

				willie
		my pleasure


	int  diner

	the brothers sit at a window of a corner diner
	jack nursing an ice coffee
	frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs  
	the glass next to them is cluttered with photographs
	of neighborhood luminaries
	including two of jack and frank in their tuxedoes

				frank

		saw you eat anything thats the gods truth

				jack

		think the city can spare you for an afternoon

	jack squints out the window

				frank
			continuing
		okay  and dont worry about a present
		i got her something from both of us


	ext  street

	jack cradling a pink bakery box in one hand
	gets out of franks car and surveys the street
	on which he grew up

				frank
		make sure you lock

	another angle

	unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
	three houses down there would not appear to be a wealth
	of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity
	but its not jacks car so he doesnt press the point

	back to scene

				frank
		place looks good huh  i got a neighbor boy to
		mow the lawn pick up five bucks  
		timesve changed huh
			pointing
		see the tree
		remember the job cecil did on it the day
		dad planted it
		you can still see the scars on the trunk  really
		i was looking at it just the other day
		jesus i thought he was gonna kill that cat

	frank smiles recalling cecils neardemise
	then raps on the front door
	jack studies the tree a moment
	then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in franks hand

				jack
		so whatd we get her

				frank
		youll see

	angle  front door

	at that moment the door swings open and ellie baker
	is there a vibrant woman in her sixties

				mrs baker
		well if it isnt the fabulous baker boys!

				frank
		hows the birthday girl

				mrs baker
		a little stiffer but just as sturdy

	mrs baker hugs frank then a bit awkwardly
	embraces jack

				mrs baker
			continuing
		john  its good to see you

				jack
			uncomfortable balancing cake box
		good to see you ma

	jack looks over his mothers shoulder at frank and
	mimics john with a knowing nod

				frank
		uh ma you know no one calls him that anymore
		jack he goes by jack

				mrs baker
		i thought maybe held gotten over that

				frank
		twenty years ma 

				mrs baker
		yes yes  its just that john is so much nicer
		jack sounds so  crude when i was a little girl
		we had a pig on the farm named jack
		i guess i just cant help making the association

	jacks eyes slide over to frank as if to suggest he
	holds his brother personally responsible for this

				frank
		uh  yeah well you know ma
		john kennedy went by jack

				mrs baker
		catholics  what do you expect  
		oh well whats in a name right
		lets go inside and have a look at that cake

	as mrs baker exits frank leans over to jack

				frank
		keep her busy will ya
		i have to set a few things up

	frank disappears leaving jack alone on the porch
	with the bakery box  jack shakes his head
	wondering how hes going to make it through the afternoon
	then enters the house

	int  house

	the front room is cluttered with his childhood  
	most noticeable are the pianos two tiny uprights
	perfectly matched their simulated ivory keys yellowed
	with age  above them pressed between glass and framed
	are the music ribbons faded by twenty years of sunlight
	finally there is the sheet music dusty and dogeared
	piled everywhere in drunken stacks
	this and all else in the room jack confronts slowly
	warily but with a noticeable dispassion
	until his eyes fall upon a photograph
	in it he and frank are standing alonside a tall man
	in baggy slacks safe within the arc of his long arms

	frank is staring straight into the camera neat clean
	perfectly posed but jack a year younger
	his shirt too big is caught in profile
	looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze

				mrs  baker
			entering
		well now wheres everyone run off to
		frank

				jack
		downstairs

				mrs baker
		oh

	all at once jack and his mother realize they are alone

				mrs baker
		well shall we cut that cake

	jack nods and follows her into the kitchen
	he places the box on the table and stands off to the
	side while mrs baker sets about preparing things

				mrs baker
		so how are you

				jack
		fine  you

				mrs baker
		oh fine

	silence
	jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake
	her fingers are trembling

				mrs baker
			continuing
		big piece or little

				jack
		huh oh no

				mrs baker
		none

				jack
		im not much for sweets

	mrs baker nods


				mrs baker
		hows that dog of yours  what was his name

				jack
		eddie

				mrs baker
		yes  right  eddie  how is he

				jack
		hes losing his teeth

	mrs baker stops and looks up into jacks eyes
	suddenly a noise is heard in the other room

				mrs baker
		sounds like your brothers back with us


	int  kitchen  day

	frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an
	old movie projector and a rollup screen

				mrs baker
			entering
		whats all this

	frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the
	tiny ribboned box

				frank
		go on

	jack watches from the kitchen doorway as mrs baker
	pulls the ribbon off the box  
	inside is a tiny spool of film

				mrs  baker
		why whats this


	int  kitchen later

	blank screen curtains drawn the room dark  
	frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake  
	mrs baker close on his elbow
	sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen  
	jack sits off to the side  
	a title card appears
	for mrs ellie baker who made it all possible
	mrs baker gives frank a puzzled look  
	he just smiles

	suddenly images spring to the screen
	obviously footage several years old
	showing jack and frank as children
	sitting at the tiny pianos wearing matching suits
	smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera

				mrs baker
		oh my god 

				frank
		recognize these two characters

				mrs baker
		i thought these were lost  
		where did you find 

				frank
		in the attic  behind some of dads stuff
			pointing with his fork
		look jack can hardly reach the pedals

	as franks laughter fills the dark room
	jack stares with cold fascination at the screen  
	suddenly a jagged cut springs the boys a year later
	in the same positions smiling the same smiles

				mrs baker
			laughing
		oh no!

				frank
		i had a boy down at the camera shop cut them
		all together  boy old man henderson didnt
		fool around when he gave a haircut did he jack

	jack says nothing

				mrs baker
		oh look at you two  so skinny
		and those tiny suits 

				frank
		wait  watch  here comes dad

	jacks eyes narrow as the film jumps another year
	and a man enters the frame obviously by accident  
	he is so tall his face cannot be seen  
	as he dances quickly out of sight
	he ruffles jacks hair

				mrs baker
		that man

	as the film jumps again
	jack glances at the photograph to his right
	the images on the screen flicker softly off
	the glass of the picture frame

				mrs  baker os
			continuing
		oh look how youre growing
		my little boys 

	jacks eyes drift from the photograph to his mother
	and brother sitting close together in the love seat
	laughing  after a moment their voices fade and jack
	looks back to the children on the screen
	like two tiny men mirror images of one another
	at first the changes are subtle  
	little jacks tie is askew his shirt missing a button
	but as the years flick by the brothers resemble one
	another less and less until finally
	the little boy that was jack is completely gone and in
	his place is a slouching touslehaired adolescent in
	rumpled coat and open collar
	a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip  
	a womans hand darts into the frame and plucks the
	offending cigarette away in a flash


	int  car

	frank and jack are parked in front of jacks building
	whispers of steam snake from the
	mancovers in the street

				jack
		i made her nervous

				frank
		what do you mean

				jack
		her hands  like that

	jack holds out a trembling hand

				frank
		nah  medication

	jack looks over at frank  he nods

				frank
			continuing
		couple years now
			taps his heart
		keeps the beat steady  nothing serious

	jack considers this a moment then gets out of the car

				frank
		she was glad to see you


	int  jacks apartment

	jack lets himself into his apartment and stops
	across the room curled up on the couch is a little girl
	jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to
	the bedroom  as he folds a blanket under her chin
	he pauses the girls face is calm peaceful


	ext  street  dawn

	the next morning  early  
	the sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
	beginning to drip out onto the street  suddenly
	ringing out over the rooftops is jingle bells
	 not the entire song just the first two bars
	over and over


	iht  jacks apartment  day

	jack on the couch his arm draped over a slumbering
	eddie opens his eyes  across the room
	seated at the piano is nina the little girl
	she stops playing and turns

				nina
		morning  you want coffee  i made coffee

	jack looks into the sleepy face of eddie and sits up
	he nods to the coffee  nina goes to the kitchen

				nina
			continuing
		i did the dishes last night youre missing a cup

	jack rubs his head then gets up and walks to the window


				nina
			continuing

				jack
		eddie did

	nina looks at eddie sleeping on the couch
	then brings jack his coffee with both hands

				nina
		i practiced the piano last night  two hours
		i think im ready for jingle all the way

	jack nods  suddenly the sound of heavy footsteps is heard
	jack and nina glance up at the ceiling

				nina
			continuing

				nina

	upstairs a door slams and heavy feet echo in the
	stairwell nina peers out the window

				nina
		no breakfast  maybe they had a fight

	two deep thumps sound on the ceiling

				nina
			continuing
		well gotta go  teach me later

	jack nods
	nina kisses him on the cheek and exits
	jack walks over to the couch and gives eddie a nudge

				jack
		hey


	int  luau lounge

	though the plastic palms and grassskirted waitresses
	of the luau lounge make the fabulous baker boys presence
	seem a bit incongruous jack and frank hold nothing back
	giving mccarthur park the full treatment  
	unfortunately the audience in the luau lounge wouldnt
	fill a hawaiian haystack and their applause
	is less than volcanic

				frank
		uh thank you  that concludes our show for this
		evening  jack and i only hope you enjoyed
		yourselves as much as we did

	as the guests wander out clutching their roomkeys
	a frecklefaced bellhop comes up

	int  hotel lobby

	jack rises as frank passes through the lobby with
	the cardboard standup

				jack
		whats with charlie

				frank
		nothing  everythings great
		terrific


	int  franks house

	with the standup under his arm
	frank enters and closes the door quietly  
	a light is glowing in the kitchen  
	the rest of the house is dark quiet  in the kitchen
	he checks the message pad by the phone  nothing  
	on the table a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him
	next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached
	frank please
	frank sighs and leans the standup against the wall  
	the photo of jack is peeling off the cardboard  
	finding a stack of glossies in a drawer
	frank removes the old jack from the standup and
	replaces it with a new one  
	as he presses the photograph in place
	his eyes drift to the one of himself  
	it was taken a long time ago


	int  jacks apartment

	jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the
	piano by the window  as the needle hits the spinning
	disc a sharp snappy bass line reverberates throughout
	the apartment  jack takes a drink then joins in with
	the record playing along  his concentration is intense
	so much so that a moment later when the phone rings
	he seems not to hear it  finally he picks it up

				jack
		yeah

				frank v0

	silence

				frank v0
			continuing
		so youll come out right

				jack
		yeah okay

	jack listens to the phone hissing in the dark
	then the connection goes dead


	ext  street

	a taxi lets jack off on a street of shabby tract houses  
	in his rumpled city suit jack looks like a cheap
	gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers  
	he walks up to the door of a small white house and
	presses the doorbell
	when there is no response he goes around to the back

	ext backyard

	the backyard is small with a short chainlink fence
	surrounding it  two kids a girl and a boy
	are splashing around in a buildityourself
	aboveground pool  
	when they see jack they stop splashing
	only their heads are visible above the water

				jack
		hey kids  dad home

	the two heads say nothing

				jack
			continuing
		what dya say  wanna run and get
		him for me

	still nothing  jack frowns takes out a cigarette
	and pats his pocket for a match

				jack
			continuing
		shit

	the kids eyes widen at his profanity  
	jack the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip
	ponders things for a moment
	then flicks thecigarette away and steps over the fence
	at which point
	the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream

				jack
			continuing
		hey kid  take it easy

	no use  the kids a worldclass screamer  
	frank wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed
	comes racing out of the house

				frank
		cindy!  what is it

	cindy points  at jack

				frank
			continuing
		jack

				jack
		your doorbell doesnt work

				frank
		honey its only uncle jack  you
		remember uncle jack

	donna franks wife appears

				donna
		whats the matter  jack

	jack waves

				frank
			lifting cindy out of the pool
		nothings the matter is it sweetheart

				donna
		ill take her inside  you too
		little frank  out of the pool

	donna shepherds the kids toward the house

				frank
		feet!

	the kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
	and disappear into the house  frank turns to jack

				frank
			continuing
		its probably the excitement of
		seeing you again


	ext  backyard later

	donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade
	the men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
	aluminum chairs

				frank
		well look at this

				donna
		you bring trunks jack

				jack

				frank
			expansively
		yeah  were gonna paint in the spring

	jack glances up  dangerous territory

				jack
		hey you werent there  right

	jacks look ends this  frank sighs

				frank
		look can we forget last night

				frank

		take on a singer

	silence

				jack

				frank
		its just an idea  i want your opinion
		i mean we go halfway on everything right

				jack
		its more like 4060 wouldnt

				frank
		we agreed that if i took care of the business

				jack
		thats what we agreed

				frank

		if youd like to assume more of the financial
		responsibilities id be glad 

				jack
		frank  fuck it  okay

		for the singer

				frank
		i thought maybe twenty percent

		they want a pretty girl with a big voice
		we have to stay competitive jack

	jack laughs coldly

				frank
		whats that

				jack

		were different  we got novelty jack
		no one can touch us

				frank
		two pianos isnt enough anymore
		jack

				jack
		it never was


	young woman

	in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
	center of a tiny room in the back of willies piano
	showroom holding some sheet music  sammy davis jrs
	face is on the sheet music  frank is sitting against
	the opposite wall a notepad in his hand  
	jack is at the piano

				frank
		good morning miss

				young woman
		moran  monica moran

				frank
		all right miss moran

				monica young woman
		actually thats my stage name

				frank
		im sorry

				monica
		moran  monica  the whole thing  
		its my stage name  my real names blanche

				frank
		blanche

				monica
		no romance right  thats why i came up with
		monica its what i prefer

				frank
		well thats fine 

				monica
		but if you call my house and my mother answers
		ask for blanche  if you ask for monica shell
		think you have the wrong number and hang up

				frank
		right

				monica
		and if she asks what its about dont tell her
		shes opposed to my career

				frank
		uhhuh  well miss moran what
		is it youd like to do for us

				monica
		candy man
			worried
		is that all right

				frank
		its one of jacks favorites

	monica turns and seeing jack at the piano
	gives a little start

				monica
		oops  i almost forgot you were
		there  heres the music

	monica begins to hand jack the sheet music

				frank
		uh he knows it

				monica
		really  isnt that a coincidence

				jack
		small world

	monica smiles  she likes jack

				frank
		well shall we

	probably not but jack begins to play anyway
	laconically picking out the cheery tune while monica
	swings her arms and taps her foot despite all this
	monica still manages to come in between beats and jack
	has to scramble over a chord to catch her
	sort of like a fireman with a net

				monica
		who can take a sunrise
		sprinkle it with dew
		toss it in the air and
		make a groovy lemon pie
		the candy man can
		the candy man can

	there would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
	mother of monica nee blanche opposes her
	daughters career

				frank
		thank you miss moran thats enough

	monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up
	frank looks over at jack  
	jack shrugs and continues to play

				frank
			continuing
		miss moran  miss moran 
		blanche!

	monicas eyes pop open

				monica
		oh sorry  i get so caught up in
		it sometimes  its scary

				frank
		yes it is

				monica
		well  thanks
			to jack
		bye

				jack
		drive carefully

	as monica exits jack and frank glance at one another
	and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
	singers who cant sing  as frank sinks lower in his
	chair and jacks ashtray spills over with wounded
	cigarettes singer after singer in all shapes sizes
	and colors come forth to offer their own unique
	interpretations of feelings i gotta be me
	this is my song and perhaps most appropriately
	what kind of fool am i
	finally when it is all over
	jack and frank are left alone in the tiny room
	looking dazed exhausted and mildly homicidal


	tall young woman

	as the sequence ends a tall young woman in high heels
	walks into willies  she glances around
	then spots willie across the room
	eating a corn beef on rye

				woman
		hey  you one of the fabulous
		baker boys


	jack and frank

	are putting on their coats preparing to leave
	frank is staring at his notepad

				frank

		that must be statistically impossible

				jack
		it was a somewhat extraordinary
		day

				frank

		would think someone  anyone 

				woman os

	the woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway
	holding a shoe in her hand  its broken

	to believe anything

	susie gives frank a dark look then turns to jack

				susie
		i get along without you slowly

	jack nods and begins to play  
	frank slouches down in his chair
	preparing to be tortured again

				susie
			continuing singing
		i get along without you very well
		of course i do
		except when soft rains fall
		and drip from leaves then i recall
		the thrill of being
		sheltered in your arms

	susie stops  frank just sits there  
	jack just sits there  she can sing

				frank
		i dont know  she had gum on her lip

				jack
			studying him

				frank
		i was just thinking what ma would

				jack
		ma ma  was ma there the last time we played the

	frank frowns and looks down at his hands

				jack
			continuing

	frank gets up wearily then glances down at the notepad

	and down the street  nothing

				frank

	jack shakes his head in disgust

	jack and frank whirl around

	there standing in the doorway is susie

				susie
		intuition


	city skyline

	gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day  
	once again jingle bells is heard
	only this time carried a little further
	jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way


	jack frank and susie

	ensconsed in the back room of willies preparing
	for their first rehearsal

	susie nods  frank poises his hands over the piano
	hesitates then looks at jack again

				susie
			looking around

		a sudden

	frank g1ares at her

				susie
			continuing
		sorry


	frank poises his hands over the piano again and
	begins to play the opening passage of
	just the way you are a moment later jack joins in
	and a moment after that susie  unfortunately
	jack and frank accustomed to playing alone
	are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
	fifth grade recital
	after a few bars susie holds up her hand

				susie
		fellas fellas 

	jack and frank stop

				frank
		whats the problem

				susie
		the problem is i cant hear myself

	willies showroom  later

	in the front of the store just out of earshot
	jack sits at a beatup grand
	while susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another

				frank
		im telling you ray  shes got
		a voice like an angel  what

	frank glances furtively across the room to where susie
	making a very sexy silhouette against the front window
	is running her hand over a pearlwhite piano

				frank
			continuing
		no i wouldnt say shes got a
		body like an angel

	as frank continues to talk in the background
	susie looks over at jack

				susie

		hell come around

	susie nods goes back to stroking the piano

				jack
			continuing

	jack and nina

	jacks tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
	ready for the nights gig  nina standing next to him
	at the sink watches as he works up a lather on a bar
	of shaving soap then paints his face with the suds

				nina
		you shave like an old movie jack

	as jack picks up a razor nina takes the brush and begins
	to soap her face in the mirror

				jack
		in the old days every man had a shaving mug that
		he kept at the barber shop  then whenever he

	as jack enters the hotel he passes by the cardboard
	standup prominently displayed in the lobby  
	it is virtually unchanged except for a small notation
	at the bottom with guest vocalist
	on the other side of the lobby

	int  lounge

	judging from the faces susies as big a hit in the
	lounge as she is in the lobby  head thrown back eyes
	closed she sings with abandon finishing on a long
	extended note then swooping down in a dramatic
	exhausted bow  there is a split second of silence
	then thunderous applause  magic


	ext  hotel

	the new trio fresh off their first gig
	come out of the service entrance into the night

				frank

	susie hurls the shoes at frank and stalks off barefoot
	jack is leaning against the wall
	watching it all with amusement

				jack

	on franks expression we hear the opening notes of
	new york new york and we see


	series of shots

	susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
	another playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences
	no empty tables now

	as the song ends we close on the cardboard standup
	newly done over with a picture of susie and an
	accompanying exclamation see the sensational susie
	diamond! as the final chord sounds we 

	cut to


	int  lloyds office

	jack and frank once again in the office of the
	supercilious lloyd waiting as he prepares their
	cash envelope

	frank glances at jack giving it to him  
	jacks eyes go cold

				jack
		well call you

	as lloyds face drops jack and frank step into the
	hallway and begin to walk slowly away playing it cool
	then glance at one another and begin to walk faster
	because theyre about to burst out laughing



	following shot

	by the time they reach the lobby they are laughing
	tripping across the carpet out the front entrance and
	onto the sidewalk where their voices explode in the
	night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz
	together laughing giddily until they see  standing
	under an awning lighting a cigarette  susie watching
	them with raised eyebrows  jack and frank frozen in a
	clumsy embrace quickly disengage and begin clearing
	their throats and squaring their cuffs  susie exhales
	a plume of smoke studies them a moment
	then smiles slightly

				susie
		night bakers

	as she turns away jack glances up watching her
	trim shadow disappear down the street


	ext  city

	gray and cold  the streets swept with rain  
	and once again the tentative piano
	jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
	oh what fun it is to ride 
	oh what fun it is to ride  oh what fun


	int  veterinary clinic

	jack and eddie are sitting in the waiting room

	jack is having a hard time imagining florence simmons

				florence simmons
			continuing

	florence simmons gives a little flutter of
	a wave and exits

	ext  hotel  day

	jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the
	hotel watching the waves tumble into one another  
	as he starts to take out a cigarette he notices
	florence simmons standing a few yards away
	with a camera

				florence simmons
		i just know my sister wont believe
		me do you mind

	jack shakes his head and florence starts to aim the
	camera

				florence simmons
		i really hate to impose  its just that the
		resemblance is so extraordinary
			focusing
		i wonder if you could turn this way so your face
		isnt in the shadows

	as jack turns he glances over florences swaying
	shoulder and sees susie and a man standing at the other
	end of the walkway  they are leaning into the wind
	her hair blowing free brushing the mans face

				florence simmons
		say cheese

	the camera clicks

				florence simmons
			continuing
		gotcha  would you like a copy for
		yourself  the hotel develops

	jack glances away from susie and the man

				jack
		no

	on jacks expression applause is heard and a moment
	later we 

	cut to


	int  dining room  night

	that evening  the trio has just finished a song and
	those on the dance floor are clapping

				frank
		thank you  you know before we came out here
		this evening susie and jack and i were looking
		over your dedications and something struck us

	susie and jack look at frank as if they have no idea
	what hes talking about

				frank
			continuing
		we realized that well were really not so
		different from one another after all  oh sure
		we may be at different points in our journey
		but we all travel pretty much the same road
		and so with that in mind wed like to introduce
		you to two very special couples  first married
		for all of two days please say hello to helen
		and bud wilson  helen  bud

	those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young
	couple from the beatup eldorado make their way to the
	front of the room

				frank
			continuing
		and now our second couple  im talking about
		ethel and bert lane ladies and gentlemen  now
		ethel and bert would be upset with me if i told
		you theyd been married for fifty years  why
		because ladies and gentlemen ethel and bert lane
		have been married for seventyfive years!

	the audience lets go with an audible ooh
	and applauds enthusiastically

				frank
			continuing
		ethel bert  get up here and
		show these kids how its done

	a path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make
	their way to the dance floor

				frank
			continuing
		arent they a sight

	they are indeed and a sight slower getting to the
	dance floor than frank anticipated

	he nods to jack and they launch into the anniversary
	waltz but have to keep repeating the opening passage
	while they wait for ethel and bert  finally everyone
	on the dance floor steps back and with some help from
	a few waiters who slide a section of tables out of the
	way ethel and bert lane begin to dance in the center
	of the room slowly but wonderfully while the younger
	couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite


	int  bathroom

	jack is sitting in the bathroom again smoking  he
	hears susies door open then voices  hers and a
	mans  he puts out his cigarette in the
	sink and leaves


	int  hotel corridor  day

	the next morning  frank the early bird is
	returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm
	whistling happily he rounds the corner just in time to
	see a man exit susies room  astonished then outraged
	he goes to susies door and knocks sharply

				susie
			opening door

		frank!

				frank

	jack just stares at her

				susie
			continuing
		yeah well thanks for sticking

				jack
		hey business is business

	he turns to leave  susies eyes narrow

				susie
		it wasnt business  it was pleasure

				jack
		just dinner and dance right


	int  dining room

	jack frank and susie are sitting at a table in the
	smaller dining room  it is conspicuously quiet  
	the main course seems to be a conscious attempt to
	ignore each other  finally susie looks at frank  
	then jack  then out the window

				susie
		paradise


	int  hotel room  night

	jack and franks room  it is new years eve

	frank sets the phone down and stares at it  
	jack studies him a moment then frank suddenly
	claps his hands

				frank
			continuing

	int  dining room  night

	a mass of swarming jubilant people  the voices are
	high and loud and theres not a hand without a
	champagne glass  couples lean into one another
	intimately dancing gaily between the tables toasting
	strangers without hesitation

				frank
			yelling to be heard

		lets hear it  ten  nine 

	gradually the entire room joins the chant

				frank/everyone
		eight  seven  six  five
		four  three  two!  one!
		happy new year!

	there is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to
	find that certain someone to kiss in the new year  
	in this moment jack frank and susie find themselves
	oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them
	their presence suddenly unnecessary forgotten  
	finally susie walks over to frank and gives him a kiss
	then goes to jack  they hesitate then kiss lightly
	pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each others
	eyes  frank sounds the first chord of auld lang syne
	and susie looks away from jack and returns to her place
	on the stage  as she begins to sing the others in the
	room all intimate friends for one brief moment
	begin to sing with her

				susie/everyone
		lest old acquaintances be forgot 

	as the voices slowly fade they are joined by the
	sound of the ocean until the ocean is all we hear
	and we see


	int  hotel room  night

	jack lying on his bed in the dark  he opens his eyes
	squinting against the light from the bathroom then
	glances over to franks bed and detects the outline
	of a body in the darkness  swinging his legs over the
	side he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes
	suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in
	the next bed shifts falling into the shaft of light cast
	from the bathroom  it is a little boy  startled jack
	stares at the sleeping boy then hears movement in the
	bathroom  rising slowly he walks to the bathroom and
	gently eases the door open a few inches  inside swimming
	murkily in the steamy mirror is the reflection of a man  
	his back is to jack but jack can see that the man is
	shaving  as jack lets his gaze drop to the floor he sees
	that water is dripping off the mans pant cuffs and
	gathering in pools on the bathroom floor  jack wakes
	up  he stares at the ceiling listening to the waves
	then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom  it is
	dark turning he glances at franks bed  its empty


	int  dining room
	dark and soundless  balloons streamers and the other
	debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow  
	frank is sitting at the window drinking as he stares at
	the ocean  as jack crosses the room he looks up

				frank
		ah well if it isnt the lad with the golden ear
		happy new year little brother

		dance  an egg dance  everyone comes dressed in
		a different colored shell and at the end of the
		evening they crack themselves open  its our job
		to separate the yolks from the whites

	frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink then
	leans his head back staring at the ceiling

				frank
			continuing

		not once in twelve years

	jack studies frank as he stares at the ceiling

	ocean

	ext  hotel  day

	the next morning  jack is sitting outside the hotel
	watching helen and bud wilson pack up the eldorado  
	the streamers by now turned to mush cling like oatmeal
	to the cars exterior  after a moment frank exits with
	a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a
	tiny souvenir shot glass

	jack shakes his head

				frank
			continuing
		ah well the kidsll break a

				helen

	bud hesitates then makes a rush for his wife but
	shes too quick and runs to the other side of the car
	frustrated he begins to run around the car like a
	madman trying to catch her  finally when he gets
	close she darts off sprinting across the parking lot

				frank

			distracted

	int  jacks apartment

	jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly
	in the darkness he can make out nina and eddie
	curled up on the couch asleep  above them
	hung carefully on a string are some paper letters
	welcome home


	int  lounge

	in a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of
	several historical eras but which might best be described
	as modern pilgrim jack susie and frank perform
	feelings while waiters in huge paul revere hats pass
	in and out of view

	int  jacks apartment  dusk

	a record is spinning on jacks phonograph as the sun
	goes down outside his window  as we move away from
	the phonograph and past the window we find jack at
	the piano playing along with the record
	lost in concentration


	ext  building  continuous action

	susie is working on a paris opal pacing occasionally
	glancing up at jacks apartment where the music can be
	heard faintly  after a moment she drops her cigarette
	on the sidewalk  there are half a dozen others
	already there


	int  jacks apartment

	the record finishes but the needle doesnt pick up
	bumping into the label  jack glances at the clock next
	to him and gets up  he puts on a jacket then takes a
	pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully


	ext  building

	as jack comes out of his building susie stops pacing
	surprised  jack wearing the same look of concentration
	he had at the piano doesnt see her and turns down the
	other end of the street  susie starts to call after
	him but stops


	ext  jazz club  night

	the sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky  
	we see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club


	int  club  night

	jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage where
	a trio is playing  he has a drink in front of him
	but it is untouched  after a moment the trio finishes
	and the pianist a huge black man named henry nods to
	the applause


				henry

		things up here every so often just to keep you
		people on your toes  so im gonna take a little
		rest grab myself a drink and let an old friend sit
		in  he drops by about once a year just to keep
		his hands clean  ladies and gentlemen  
		jack baker

	jack rises to polite applause and shakes henrys hand  
	as he settles behind the piano he sits for a moment
	not moving then nods to the two men behind him  as they
	begin to play we recognize the music from the record  
	jack waits then brings his hands to the keys  as he
	plays his face is suddenly calm  peaceful


	ext  club  night

	later  jack comes out of the club and into the night
	lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street

	susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly
	about the room slipping in and out of the shadows as
	if they were veils

				susie
			at window

		steak flowers sometimes even a gift  usually
		whatever the guy was into  got a socket set once

		your life  but it dont  the bed may be magic but
		the mirror isnt  you wake up the same old susie
			pause

	jack suddenly bolts forward and grabs frank by the
	lapels

				frank
			continuing
		hey whatre you doing  hey!

	jack flings frank against the wall pounding pulling
	and slamming him in a fitful rage

				frank
			continuing scared
		jack!  jack! 

	frank slides to the ground afraid trying to protect
	himself  jack hovers over him

				jack
		hows it feel to have your little brother beat
		the shit out of you  huh  huh!

	jack comes down with a vicious fist at franks face  
	frank holds up his hands trying to shield himself
	and catches a blow on his fingers

				frank
		my hands!  my hands!

	jack grabs one of franks hands

				jack
			mocking
		your hands  your hands couldnt take the blue
		ribbon on amateur night

	jack bends back franks fingers

				frank
			terrified
		jack!

				jack
		whos weak now big brother

	jack pushes franks fingers until the knuckles crack

				frank
		jack!  jack!

	franks voice echoes high above the sound of the rain  
	suddenly jack stops  looking at franks hand still
	clasped in his he seems as shocked by his own behavior
	as frank  letting go he steps back awkwardly and looks
	at his brother beaten to the ground his tuxedo ripped
	and dirty  he stares at his own hands the knuckles split
	and bleeding  he no longer looks dangerous  he looks
	hollow frightened

				jack
		im through with it  i cant do
		it anymore

	frank rubbing his fingers glances up at jack but jack
	just turns away leaving frank on the sidewalk and
	disappears into the rain  music begins  a sad plaintive
	solo piano  and we see


	series of shots

	jack crossing the street to his apartment the rain
	over now

	frank driving home his face swollen and bruised in the
	dim glow of the streetlights

	jack letting himself into his apartment and standing
	there  alone

	frank easing the car into the driveway turning off
	the engine

	jack taking a bottle from the kitchen moving numbly

	frank much later still sitting in the driveway as
	the sun begins to come up

	jack sitting in the phone booth the bottle in his hand


	int  jacks apartment  day

	the next morning  jack is sitting on the windowsill
	watching the rain drum the glass  he glances at the phone
	across the room takes another look at the rain then goes
	to the phone  he picks it up hesitantly then dials  
	it rings  again  again

				cindy v0

	jack sets the phone back down on the cradle


	int  bar

	jack stands in a dark bar  it is early morning and the
	light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere  
	a big beefy man with a bar towel hooked in his belt is
	talking to jack

				man
		if they wanna talk about their wife you listen  
		if they wanna talk about their job you listen  
		if they wanna talk about their parakeet you listen

		that it

				man

	jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note

				jack
		its out of tune

				man

		itll be in tune

	the music returns sad and plaintive and we see


	int  franks house

	frank attempting to give piano lessons to a brother
	and sister tandem who would be better served by an
	obedience school  while the little girl pounds
	incessantly on the piano her brother runs circles
	around the room destroying everything in sight

	music continues and we see


	ext  street
	jack and eddie going for a walk passing the diner
	where jack and franks pictures are still displayed

	music continues and we see


	int  bar

	jack in the bar playing the music weve been hearing
	throughout the previous scenes  it is after midnight
	and the tables are empty  only a few somber men remain
	at the bar  they do not appear to be music lovers  
	as jack finishes he takes a cloth and wipes the keys  
	there is a glass on the piano with money in it

				susie os

	ext  street

	jack is standing across the street from his mothers
	house just looking  after a moment he crosses the
	street  as he moves up the drive he takes notice of
	the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it
	kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there 
	cats claws  running vertically up the tree the
	damage smoothed and widened by time  he runs his
	fingers over the imperfection then stands and walks
	toward the house


	ext  house

	through the screen door jack can hear a clicking
	sound and see partially into the front door  half
	the room is cast in shadow the other in blinding light  
	he opens the door and enters


	int  house

	inside the movie projector is running the tail of a
	completed flip slapping like a whip against the carriage  
	jack turns off the projector and the room falls entirely
	into shadow  for a moment the house is silent full of
	ghosts then gradually a noise is heard coming from the
	kitchen


	int  kitchen

	as jack comes into the kitchen he finds frank searching
	through a cabinet  he watches for a moment

				jack

	handmade curtains lightly faded

				frank

	stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and
	gestures jack to the other

	jack steps over to the other piano and taps then frank
	does the same  jack glances up in surprise

				frank
			continuing

	jack hits the note again and nods in amazement

				frank
			continuing
		all these years  she kept them in tune  
		can you imagine  
		now why would she do something like that

	frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades  
	suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot
	glasses on top of the piano each bearing the name of a
	different hotel

				frank
			continuing
		hey what do you know  looks like we can have
		that drink after all

	jack and frank glance at one another little boy
	mischief glowing in their faces  suddenly they swivel
	on the pianos and begin to play youre sixteen

		she comes on like a dream
		peaches and cream
		lips like strawberry wine
		shes sixteen shes beautiful and shes mine
		ribbons and curls
		ooh what a girl

	as jack and frank finish theyre laughing  after a
	moment their voices die and the house is quiet again  
	full of ghosts  each stares at the tiny keyboard before
	him awkward with the intimacy of the moment  it is
	quiet for a very long time  finally frank looks over

				frank
		well  one more time

	jack glances up and sees frank has his empty glass
	held out  he hesitates then picks up the bottle

				jack
		one more time
