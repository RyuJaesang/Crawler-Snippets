                         of course a guy will listen to 
                         anything if he thinks its foreplay

               annie poses in front of the mirror  she smoothes her dress 
               along her hips and puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses 
               stylish and slightly mad

                         sometimes it seems like a bad trade
                              quickly rebounding
                         but bad trades are part of baseball  
                         who can forget frank robinson or
