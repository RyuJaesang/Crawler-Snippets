          she throws all around the place still madder at not finding her
          dress a cat who was lying on the armrest of the sofa runs away

          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips then on her
          teeth then all around her mouth she makes faces to herself in

          it in her purse then takes it out spins the cylinder of the
          revolver and puts the revolver in her mouth as if she wanted to

           the problem is that if you and buck are going to smoke in
           here then the door to doctor moores office must remain
           opened in minimum of fifteen inches
                         
          buck comes and sits next to casey they smoke together

          buck and casey puff clouds of smoke
                         
                          clark
           and i would also like to suggest that you buy one of those
           ashtrays
                         
                          sondra

           anything about this bob

          to her seat

                          casey

                          casey
           im saying sondra that you really really have to hate a
           person to stab him that many times youre a shrink
           right  you know what kind of power people hand over a
           shrink or maybe sometimes they hand even more than they
           want to
                         
                          clark
           that is absolutely correct a thief would not stick around
           and stab someone thirty times
                         
                          buck

                          richie
          he has seated himself behind sondra and puts his hand on her
          shoulder

           replace bob
          casey sits down
                         
                          sondra

                          casey

          she gets up and sits down in front of bill she takes the cushion
          which was on the armchair and hugs it

                          bill
          during the following reply richie comes and sits behind sondra

          bill on the sidewalk
                         
          bobs residence  exterior night

          behind him he dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind
          the door he looks cautiously around him before walking further

          walks slowly while the door closes behind him he hesitates a
          moment then walk more decidedly and falls heavily on the floor !

           get upset if someone tries to tell me before i can figure
           it out for myself you know

           play safe youre trying to think of a case instead of
           thinking of a female

          entrance he strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress
          a bit down then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her
          thigh

           dead concert the first sound he ever heard was beat it on
           down the line

          bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room
           normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways
                         
                          dale

          road in front of bobs residence  exterior day
                         
          we see bill bare chest wearing sneakers short pants and cap
          running toward us his tshirt is hanging at his side partly
          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts bill stops running when
          he reaches the mailbox hesitates one moment comes two steps back
          and opens the box closeup on the box inside of which a coiled
          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue the snake rattles
          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box with its
          mouth wide open bill falls on the road where he remains seated
          without moving the snake with the back half of his body still in
          the box doesnt seem to know what it must do next
           a car arrives at a high rate of speed since a pickup is parked
          on the other side of the road the car must zigzag and it barely
          avoid driving on bill
                         
                          bill
          yelling to the driver
           hey !
                         
          the car honks we get a closeup of the driver when the car comes
          very close to bill
                         
                          the driver
           you idiot !
                         
          bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing
          dead leaves on the bank of the road
                         
                          bill
          he yells to the city worker but with the loud noise of his power
          blower the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his
          work
           hey ! hey ! help ! shit !
          bill crawls back a little then he eventually stands up he
          crosses the road and takes a big shovel in the pickup truck
           fuck !
          he crosses the road back the snake is back in the mailbox
           hello !
          bill hits the box very hard with the shovel snake and mail fall
          on the road bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the
          road
           i am not goin back to new york you hear me  youre stuck
           with me !
          bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road he looks
          at the envelopes
           fuckin bill great
                         
          we see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the

          the earrings sondra just gave her she sighs

          undressing in front of her friend

          more and more embarrassed she snickers stupidly rose looks at

          she starts gathering her belongings
           if you dont know i thought we were just going to have a
           nice afternoon together maybe have dinner
                         
                          sondra
          she puts the telephone back on its stand and takes roses arm
           well we can oh dont worry dont be upset you can stay
           here really
                         
                          rose
          she closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder
           you just dont understand do you
                         
                          sondra

          she turns to rose to look at her face
                         
                          rose
          rose kisses sondra tenderly on the lips
           thats more like it ciao
                         
          she leaves the room sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss she
          puts her hands on her chest
                         
                          sondra
           oh my god

          sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before
          opening the front door
           she opens the door to face bill whom she almost jostle to get
          outside as fast as possible through a low window we see her
          going down the stairs to the street
           larger shot we discover the sittingroom next to the hall good
          taste expensive furniture nice paintings concert piano
           sondra gets down the stairs bill who was looking around him

          she sits on a small sofa without back

           what did you come here for
                         
                          bill

           do with all of you and i know that youre very close with
           richie and i was wondering if you could tell me anything
           that might help me understand him a little better
                         
                          sondra
           richies my little baby
                         
                          bill
           his brother dale thinks that your little baby should
           be taken out of therapy
                         
                          sondra
           thats insane!
                         
                          bill
          he gets up
           i think its a mistake too
          he goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park
                          sondra
           that dale is a dangerous bastard
                         
                          bill
           but he obviously seems to care for richie a great deal
           theres a big gap in richies life up until about a year
           ago did he ever mention a dr niedelmeyer to you 
                         
                          sondra
           i dont have much to tell richies okay hes sweet did
           you know that he was molested as a child 
          she has tears in her eyes
                         
                          bill
           no i didnt know that
          he comes back to her
           its sticking out all over
          he sits on the bench of the piano
                         
                          sondra
           its fashionable
          she laughs nervously
           i mean it pays well at least you know you can write a
           book go on oprah
                         
                          bill
           that was quite a show he gave us in group you think richie
           has a violent streak 
                         
                          sondra
          she sighs
           oh lets cut to the chase richie did not kill bob moore
           you know its really swell snooping around here
          she gets up
            sniffing for blood on other peoples hands while
           pretending to help your patients 
                         
                          bill
           you really think that i dont care about richie 
                         
                          sondra
          she gets upset
           richie wouldnt hurt a fly ! why dont you take a look at
           someone dangerous why dont you take a look at someone who
           could do it ! why dont you take a look at clark !
                         
                          bill
           clark 
                         
                          sondra
          she gets more and more upset
           clark ! clark ! clark is a sneaky lying buttondown son
           of a bitch who pretends to be this gentle creature ! i
           heard him screaming one night at bob it made the hairs on
           my neck stand up ! anyway i hope that they fry
           whoever did it and it takes a really long time and
           then and then a fuse blows they have to start all over
           again
          she sits back bill has been listening to her outburst without
          reacting
           we hear the front door chimes and sondras expression changes
          immediately her angry face becomes suddenly softer
           she snickers and puts her tongue to her lips
           wow ! thats my trainer
          she gets up and sniffs a bit
           i gotta go i gotta get the door
          she goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young
          man wearing a sleeveless tshirt
           this is my trainer chris
                         
                          bill
           hi
          chris just nods his head
           byebye
          bill gets out as soon as the door is closes sondra literally
          jumps in chris arms and starts giggling
                         
                          sondra
           i dont feel like lifting weights today
                         
                          chris
           okay
                          sondra
           lets do something else
          she bursts laughing
           through the low window we see bill going down the stairs to the
          street he stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !
                         
          dales workshop  parking  exterior day
                         
          bobs car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building on a
          desert parking lot the building could be an old factory
          reconverted by dale into a workshop to make his furniture a very
          high chimney above the building
           bill dressed in jeans and lightcolored shirt gets out of the
          car and walks toward the building he passes a board that
          indicates the location of the «office» he knocks at a door with a
          window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the dog» the
          dog starts barking bill knocks again he tries to look through
          the door window the dog keeps on barking
           bill comes back the way he came toward the «office» he stops in
          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside he
          knocks on the window he turns around and we catch a quick
          glimpse of someone behind the window
           bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men
          are unloading
                         
                          bill
           hey! is this dale dexters shop here
                         
          one of the men nods and shows the main door to bill
                         
          dales workshop  interior day
                         
          entrance of the workshop the door opens and bill appears he
          takes off his sunglasses puts them in the pocket of his shirt and
          gets in
           the workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated
          on the roof of a small structure perhaps the quoted «office»
          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to
          watch bill
           bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks
          someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood
           bill looks around him looking a bit anxious several men are
          working he approaches one of them wearing a sleeveless tshirt
          and who is welding with a protection mask covering his face
                         
                          bill
           excuse me
                         
          the man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding he
          raises his mask  its dale
                         
                          dale
           hello did you go to the house
                         
                          bill

          dale shuts his blowtorch off
           i would have phone ahead but uh i dont have your phone
           number in our file

           sleeping around and projecting his fantasies and desires

          giggly voice sounding like a childs voice
           hey pukeface look around cant you see me  im in the
           red car
          bill looks around him on the freeway and sees a red car on his
          right

           shithead capa
          strange sounding giggles
                         
                          bill
           does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket

           scalpel doctor
                         
          bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red
          car which is still following him the red car catches up with him
          and bumps into him bill jumps up
                         
                          bill
           goddamn it !
                         
          the red car bumps into him a second time and looses part of its
          radiator grill
           third bumps bill is now out of the freeway and on a road
          downtown
           the two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars lot of
          honking
           without warning bill turns on a side street on his right and
          gets honked by the other cars in spite of the very dangerous
          driving of bill among the other cars the red car keeps on
          following him
           to follow bill the red car must take a vey sharp left turn and
          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the
          pavement
           the chase goes on the red car is dented everywhere it catches
          up with bill overtakes him and bumps violently into bills car
          right side
                          bill
           fuck you !
          the red car hits him on the right side twice in a row
           fuck you!
          bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it
          they move together and bill tries to bring the red car as close
          to the curb as possible
           get the you ohh! get the fuck
          the red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open
          door of a parked car and then knocks down the shopping caddie of
          a woman fortunately the woman is able to move away but all her
          shopping items are scattered on the pavement the two car bump
          again into each other and arrive into a main road
           when the red car wants to hit bills car again bill stands on
          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars the
          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic the last car on
          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road
          bill barely avoids it another car gets loose from the truck and
          causes a pileup on the road
           bill zigzag out of the pileup and comes to a crossing with a
          railway a train is approaching the red car is still behind bill
          bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway then
          starts moving backwards he hits the front of the red car and
          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the
          railway itself the train keeps on honking to move the cars away
           hey! you wanna die ! huh  you wanna die 
          we see the driver of the train working madly on his brake and
          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes
           just before the train reaches the crossing bill jumps his car
          forward and the red car quickly moves backward
           bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back
          we see the train moving behind him

          bar hector and bill raises their heads we hear the engine of a
          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker

          album
           i dont know why he kept this hidden back here except
           maybe because it had a picture of his wife naked which

          he sits back next to rose and start looking at the new album

          dale raises his nailgun slowly but hector appears from behind a
          wall holding a «real» gun

          bill immediately dale shoots him hector bends down a little
          because of the pain and stands back up to shoot dale but dale is
          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood
          panel

          fingers
                         
                          hector

          bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm he runs away with
          rose
           we follows them through the workshop as they reach a staircase
          we hear an engine starting then a whole block of shelves falls in
          front of them we see dale in a small glass cabin his hands on
          the controls of a handling machine
           bill moves rose away from him

           lets go!
                         
           just as a huge piece of furniture falls on bill who falls
          down stuck under the furniture
                         
                          rose

          dale appears behind bill and wraps a leather belt around his
          neck he tightens the belt bill suffocates dale pulls him by the
          belt across the workshop
                         
                          dale

          the cage bill tries with both hands to move the belt away from
          his throat
                         
                          bill

          hear the sound of the nailgun and a nail gets stuck in dales
          shoulder the saw stops dale walks back a few steps to face rose
          holding the nailgun pointed on him

          his forehead dale falls down rose starts screaming

          her throat and presses the trigger but it doesnt work she
          tries again it still doesnt work the gun must be empty

          bill eventually succeeds in getting free but rose after she has
          thrown the gun away starts running through the workshop
           no !

          rain is soaking both of them but they keep on climbing thunder
          is rumbling

          climbing on it

          she yells

          rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform
           just stay there !
                         
                          rose

                          rose
          she puts her hand out to bills strutted hand we hear the sound
          of a high gust of wind and rose looses her balance and starts
          falling backward
           l no
                         
                          bill

          she yells
           no !
                         
          bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the
          platform his momentum makes him swing and he catches roses arm
          just as she was falling from the outer ring with his other arm he
          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth they
          eventually reach the chimney ladder rose grabs one of the rungs
          followed by bill who pushes her up
                         
                          bill
           come on
                         
          they move back to the platform and as soon as they reach it
          they hug each other very tight bill looks at the beacon on the
          top of the chimney from white the beacon becomes red which is
          its real color bill smiles  he sees red again he hugs rose even
          more tightly
                         
                          hectors voice
          while the camera pans away from the platfom showing the whole
          platform with bill and rose holding each other we hear hectors
          voice
