    is not the new 40 and because of that she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful everything about this
    womans appearance screams solid

    his killer smile or his ability to charm he lifts his
    glass of champagne

    sister lauren 26 is trying to fit everything into the

    gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight                      
                        lauren
              maybe you should get a dog

                           jane

              you

                        harley
                  heading for their car and
                   getting into the
                   passenger seat
              love you boss!

    as lauren and harley drive off    jane turns and looks at her
    suddenly very empty nest


4   int janes house  continuous                                    4
    a womans house books and art collected over years
    interesting unexpected pieces of furniture jane kicks off
    her heels now feeling short and alone deep breath!


5   int kitchen                                                      5
    cramped but clearly a cooks kitchen      the kids have left a       
    few glasses and plates on the island
                                                              9


    jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink she          
    suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone she pauses            
    allows herself the moment then forces herself to snap out of      
    it                                                                


7   int the bakery  montecito  day                             7    
    this is janes other home a large bright bustling
    bakery/restaurant the bakery counter could rival any in
    paris last year the new york times rated janes pain au          
    chocolat the best in the united states a line waits to get
    in

    a very relaxed jane is behind the busy counter easily moving
    between her young staff the atmosphere is efficient and           
    friendly

    jane adjusts a few signs on the counter then reaches inside
    the display case pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
    powdered sugar she carries the tray to the open pass
    through to the busy kitchen and calls to the head baker

                        jane
              reynaldo
                  nods to the muffins

                        reynaldo
              too much sugar

                        jane
              little bit                                              
    reynaldo nods as jane hands him the tray                          
    jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter
    knowing what to do janes staff has already set out cups of
    coffee with lids

                        jane
              who wants coffee while theyre
              waiting

    jane and the staff hand out the free coffee

    jane walks the counter  moments later

    refills a glass of water checking on her customers               
                        jane
                  quietly to a young                                  
                   employee
              check on table five will you

    the young employee nods as jane looks up and sees a man on         
    the other side of the counter they exchange polite hellos         
    when jane notices peter tan and confident approaching her       
                        jane
                  all smiles

9   int doctors office  following                              9
    way too chic for a dentists office jane sits nervously in
    a chair in a well styled well upholstered examination room
    the door opens quickly and a handsome crisp looking doctor
    enters

                         jane
              hi

                        doctor

                        jane
                  shaking his hand
              hi jane adler so i just wanted
              to start with and please dont
              take this the wrong way but im the
              type of person who kind of makes
              fun of people who get plastic
              surgery

                        dr moss
              i understand

                        jane
              you do good because you know
              some women can look a little fake                        
              and plasticky and in my opinion 
              worse

                         dr moss
              i agree

                        jane
              oh thats good so well as
              against the whole thing as i am i
              do have a problem thats been
              bugging me my left eyelid is
              really saggy i find im sometimes
              holding it up when im watching tv
              or reading and i was wondering if
              thats something you could fix

                        dr moss
                  looking at her closely
              its resting on your eye lashes                         
                         jane
              is it
                                                              14



                         dr moss
                   measures her lids with a
                    very tiny ruler
               actually you have the same amount
               of excess skin on both sides

                         jane
               i do well im only interested in
               fixing one eye                                       
                         dr moss
               jane what you need to fix this is
               a brow lift

                         jane
               a brow lift whwhat is that
               exactly

                           dr moss
               we surgically cut at your hair
               line incision goes right across                      
               here                                                 
                   demonstrates on himself
                     by indicating a line
                     drawn like a headband
               then we just lift the skin up a
               little tighter across the skull
                   jane nods already hating
                     this
               we staple it back in place right
               above your ears recovery isnt
               all that bad but you could be
               fairly numb and youll probably                       
               have a headache that lasts anywhere
               from say 3 to 6 months


10   int elevator doors opening                               10
     jane flies into the elevator out of breath and a little
     nauseous she taps on the lobby button   the elevator moves
     down ping the doors open and jane looks into an empty
     hallway facing a sign that reads santa barbara fertility
     center helping couples become parents

     jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator steps
     back toward the corner a messy looking 5 year old boy          
     dashes in jane recognizes him she looks up and jake and
     his wife agness in oversized dark shades and a long black     
     dress very angelina jolie get on the elevator obviously      
     midargument
                                                         15



agness mood seems very dark today they instantly shut up
when they realize jane is in the elevator

                     agness
          jane!

                     jane

          hello

                    agness
              pushing the lobby button
               mumbles

elevator

                    agness
          pedro up! now!!

                    jake

          building

          you dont go to sharon anymore

                    jane
          uh no changed

jane looks at the fertility literature in jakes hand just as
jake slips it behind his back an awful two seconds of
silence then jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on agness
back it creeps her out

                just follow a few basic rules to
               make your divorce a less hurtful
               one by breaking the cycle of
               conflict

     on adam  driving

                         male narrator vo
               accept your ex for who she is

               in love and

                         adam

adams pov  jane

jogging right past his car listening to her ipod

                    adam
          jane!

she doesnt hear him adam backs up next to her jane slows
down adam lowers the passenger window she looks in
doesnt recognize him at first

                    adam
          its adam

               front seat
          surecome on in

jane gets into the car just in time to hear

                    male narrator vo
           but perhaps the most important
          lesson in going through your
          divorce is to learn to forgive
          forgiveness is the key to

adam hits the cd knob to turn the cd off but instead he
accidentally fast forwards

                    male narrator vo
          in spite of your hurt feelings
          prove to her that you can be a
          mature

adam hits the knob again and this time turns it off a bit
mortified

          just getting a divorce
                                                               34

                    adam
          everyone i know or have ever known
          has fixed me up and then

          dont know how that happens but

                    jane
           but no girlfriend

          these days i cant tell you how                         
          nice it is to have a conversation                        
          with a woman and have the pressure
          off not to mention a home cooked
          meal that no one else i know could
          possibly cook

janes not sure if she feels a little hurt by that   she
smiles wiping the counter

                    adam

     he peeks in the window balancing himself precariously on a         
     stack of loose bricks he sees jane telling adam a story and        
     both of them cracking up jake leans in further to try to           
     hear what janes saying when the bricks slip under his feet        
     he loses his balance and drops out of the frame

                         adam
               this was so nice and relaxing and
               the lavender ice cream was actually

          him because honestly if the                     
          guilt and fear could go away maybe
          i could let go a little and figure                 
          this out

                    dr allen
          i wouldnt resist looking at this

                    jane
              mulls that over quickly                      
          okay and another way of saying                  
          that is

                    dr allen
          let go jane it cant hurt

          how long have you been taking the           
          flomax

                    jake

          sporadically i have to sneak it
          actually
              explains confidentially
          it reduces semen and thats not
          good for my wife right now
              to jane
          sorry
                                                              70

                      looks over at jane
                  really

                            jane
                  yes i prefer a lot of semen
                  always have
                      rises
                  okay well thank you so much for                   
                  coming looks like hes gonna live
                  so

                            hotel doc
                      packing up
                  yeah my guess is flomax is
                  probably the culprit here it can
                  definitely give you a sudden drop
                  in blood pressure so i suggest you
                  stay off it for a few weeks which
                  apparently your wife will
                  appreciate
                      holds in a chuckle

                             jane
                  yeah   really good for me

                            hotel doc
                  and i suggest you rest quietly for

                      to jane

                    jane
          knowing how to be divorced is next
          to impossible and sometimes over
          the years ive thought that your
          dad and i werent quite finished
          and as it turns out we werent
          so i went out of my comfort zone
          which i found out if youre
          really honest with yourself isnt
          all that comforting so i
          experimented with a part of myself
          i wanted to find out if after all
          these years there was still
          something there between us

                    lauren
          and was there

                    jane
          there kinda was

          but mom you have to understand how
          bonkers this sounds to us for two
          people who for years couldnt be in
          the same room togetherto then
          have an affair you and dad!

                    jane
          i knowit was hard for me and i
          was doing it i hope youll
          forgive me for confusing you or
          betraying your trust but i did
          this for me and for him and i
          realized even though your dad and i
          once had something extraordinary
          we no longer really fit together
          but he is a part of me and always
          will be

                    luke
          so its over now you guys are
          back to being divorced

                          jane
                i didnt call you last night                             
                because i wasnt sure you would
                take the call and then i thought
                that could go on for months and                       
                          adam
                 i would have taken the call

                          jane
                oh well anyway its better to
                say these things in person adam
                the man i was seeing was

                          adam
                i think im up to speed on that
                part

                    jane
          i want you to know it didnt last
          long and youre divorced so maybe
          you understand when marriages end
          theres doubts and hurt and youve
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself

                    adam
           i get it i could imagine iti
          could

                    jane
          i told him it wasnt going to work
          between us but i guess he didnt
          believe me and unbeknownst to me
          he showed up at my house yesterday
          he left agness and

                    adam
           jane i actually think i
          understand what happened
          butuhyou know im not as
          macho as i appear and i think its
          probably best for us not to get any
          more involved because your
          relationship with jake isnt really
          done and i know youre saying it
          is but hes in love with you and
          for everyones sake that should
          probably get resolved

                     jane
          wow   so thats how grown ups talk

adam smiles

                    jane
          please tell me youre not going to
          quit my job and ask peter to take
          over because then ill never get to
          see you and

                    adam

                it may never have happened if i
