	statues and paintings of former presidents we hear shards of
	dialogue from various presidential speeches


	main titles end on


	ext beautiful establishing shot of the white house  day

	its an early november morning and the sun has just come
	over this extraordinary building we hold on this for a moment
	before we

                                                            cut to

	int a corridor in the residence  day

	a secret service agent presses the button by the private
	elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff

				agent cooper
		libertys moving

	another agent rounds the corner into the corridor and is
	followed a step or two later by

	president andrew benjamin shepherd

	shepherds walking with his personal assistant janie a shy
	professional and incredibly efficient 25yearold

				shepherd
		well it wouldnt be a monday morning
		unless lewis was concerned about
		something i did sunday night

	the elevator doors open revealing lewis rothschild at 32
	lewis is the presidents chief domestic policy advisor it
	would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night
	though that doesnt seem to slow him down

				lewis
		you skipped the whole paragraph

				shepherd
			   to janie
		and monday morning it is

	lewis falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
	double doors leading to the south lawn

				lewis

	to being the presidents chief of staff and closest advisor
	hes the presidents closest and oldest friend

				aj
		is that the letter from solomon at
		the gdc

				shepherd
		it would appear to be a letter from
		the entire environmental community
		these people are outta control

				aj
		i think theyre just frustrated
		mr president

				robin
		are they blaming the president for
		global warming

				aj
		well they dont think he caused it
		if thats what you mean

			   continuing
			    to shepherd
		sir im on the phone with these
		people twice a week i honestly
		dont know what they want at this
		point

				lewis
		what they want is a 20 percent reduction in
		fossil fuel emissions

				aj
		it wont pass at 20 percent

				lewis
		we havent really tried

				aj
		lewis mcsorley mccluskey and shane
		hold too many markers if we try to
		push this through and lose there will
		be a very loud thud when we hit the
		ground and thats not what you want in
		an election year

				shepherd
		talk to the gdc again aj tell them
		the president resents the implication
		that hes turned his back on the
		environment tell them ill send 455 to
		the floor but were gonna ask for a
		10 percent reduction if they want to pull
		their support fine at 63 percent job
		approval rating i dont need their help
		getting a bill passed we gotta get going
		wheres leon

				aj
			   to an aide
		would you call mr kodak and tell him
		the presidents

	ajs sentence is cut short by the sound of a headon
	pedestrian collision in the outer office

				mrs chapil os
		aaagh!

				kodak os
		sorry! sorry my fault

				aj
			   to the aide
		never mind

	leon kodak comes into the oval office the white house
	pollster is a likable if clumsy numbers whiz he along
	with aj lewis and robin are regarded as the presidents
	starting team the people in this room have grown very close
	over the past few years

				kodak
		excuse me good morning mr president

				shepherd
		you all right

				kodak
		they keep moving that big ficus plant

				aj
		were all here mr president

				shepherd
		okay first i wanted to say
		congratulations three years ago we
		were elected to the white house by
		one of the narrowest margins in history
		and today kodak tells us 63 percent of
		registered voters think were doing a
		good job

				kodak
		wait a second you wanted me to poll
		registered voters

	everyone laughs even shepherd smiles

				shepherd
		but the poll also tells us what we
		already knew we dont get this
		crime bill of ours through congress
		and these numbers are gonna be a
		memory so starting today were
		shifting it into gear

				robin
		can i tell my morning press gaggle
		that gun control

				aj
		crime control robin gun control
		means were wimps and were soft on
		crime

		restrictions!

				aj
		were leaving em out

				lewis
		sir we campaigned on this issue
		now i understand we took it out when
		we were in the low forties but we
		can push it through now

				shepherd
		after the elections

				lewis
		sir we may never have an opportunity
		like this again lets take this 63
		percent out for a spin and see what
		it can do

				shepherd
		we cant take it out for a spin lewis
		we need it to get reelected for
		reasons passing understanding people
		do not relate guns to gunrelated crime

				aj
		robin you can brief the press this
		afternoon as of today the crime
		bills priority one on the presidents
		domestic agenda

	temper

	int ajs office  day

				aj
		your concerns are not falling on deaf
		ears the environmental lobby has
		known no greater alley in the white
		house than president shepherd

				sydney
		hardly an impressive distinction aj

	susan is trying to avert the inevitable

				susan
		sydney we should leave mr macinerney
		alone now hes already given us more
		time than

				sydney
		susan mr macinerney doesnt want
		us to leave because mr macinerneys
		not yet done what he needs to do today

				susan
		sir ms wades been thrown into the
		deep end of the pool on her first day
		she hasnt even had a chance to read
		the report of the quebec conference

	sydney  whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes
	check her swing smile and leave the building  decides
	instead to hit the gas and swing away the others are watching
	this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck

				sydney
		youre right i havent read it if
		someone had asked me yesterday id
		have told them the quebec conference
		was made up of six professional hockey
		teams but what i do know is that its
		time for the president to run for
		president again leon kodak is as good
		as it gets when it comes to electoral
		strategy and im certain hes told the
		president exactly what id tell him
		nail down michigan and california
		where they make cars and airplanes 
		and burn plenty of fossil fuel but if
		i had read these eight hundred pages
		i would have discovered that its the
		burning of fossil fuels thats been
		mostly responsible for global warming and
		that the 20 percent reduction recommended
		by the gdc is a necessary first step
		toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
		effect that has gone unchecked by this
		administration

				susan
			   to sydney
		its really time to

				sydney
		susan i promise you the white house
		chief of staff will not let us leave
		here until hes broken the bad news

	no one in the room really understands whats going on
	except aj who would like to take the time to admire
	sydney but of course cant

				aj
			   pause
		im afraid sydneys right although
		not about michigan and california
		the president has asked me to convey
		to you that hes sending his energy
		bill to the floor with a call for a
		reduction of 10 percent

	theres an uncomfortable silence in the room

				aj
			   continuing
		the president is willing to go it
		alone on this but hes asking for
		and frankly hes expecting the full
		support of the gdc

				sydney
		the presidents expecting our full
		support

				aj
		yes he is

				sydney
		the presidents dreamin aj

				susan
		sydney!

				sydney
		the president has critically
		misjudged reality if he honestly
		thinks that the environmental
		community is going to whistle a
		happy tune while rallying support
		around this pitifully lame mockery of
		environmental leadership just because
		hes a nice guy and hes done better
		than his predecessors then your boss
		is the chief executive of fantasyland

				voice os

	on a window ledge tries not to look down  trying not to
	notice things like the jfk desk the seal of the president of
	the united states the bust of lincoln

	shepherd strides in

				shepherd
		sorry to keep you waiting

				sydney
		mr president

				shepherd
		is it okay if i call you sydney

				sydney
		of course mr president

				shepherd
		have you ever been in the oval office

				sydney
		ive just been on the regular tour
		it didnt include

				shepherd
		i hear its pretty good

				sydney
		mr president what you saw in there
		was nothing more than vanity run amok
		i was showing off for a colleague who
		doesnt think very much of me itd
		be a real injustice for you to hold the
		gdc accountable for my behavior today
		on top of which im monumentally sorry
		for having insulted you like that

				shepherd
		are you under the impression that im
		mad at you

				sydney
			   pause
		well

				shepherd
		sydney seldom does a day go by that
		im not burned in effigy

				sydney
		not by a professional political
		operative standing 30 feet from the
		oval office

				shepherd
		no ill give you that

				sydney
		mr president

				shepherd
		did you know that when the city
		planners sat down to design
		washington dc their intention was
		to build a city that would intimidate
		and humble foreign heads of state
		its true

				sydney
		i didnt know that


				shepherd
		the white house has the single
		greatest home court advantage in the
		modern world

				sydney
		learned that one the hard way

				shepherd
		sydney this bill is important to me

				sydney
		yes sir ill convey your message

				shepherd
		but you dont believe me

				sydney
		the gdc is asking for 20 percent sir

				shepherd
		its not gonna pass at 20 percent
		its a long shot at 10

				sydney
		how do you know that until you put
		the full weight of the white house
		behind

				shepherd
		sydney at 20 percent we are 34 votes
		shy in the house it cant be done
		but i tell you what ill make you a
		deal with you if you can get 24
		votes ill get you the last 10

				sydney
		twentyfour votes

				shepherd
		if you can swing 24 votes by the
		state of the union ill promise you
		full white house support

				sydney
		do i have your word on that sir

				shepherd
		absolutely listen are you hungry
		i skipped breakfast you wanna have
		some coffee a donut or something

				sydney
		sir im a little intimidated by my
		surroundings and yes ive gotten
		off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
		beginning but dont let that
		diminish the weight of my message
		the gdc has been at every president
		for the last decade and a half that
		global warming is a calamity the
		effects of which will be second only
		to nuclear war the best scientists
		in the world have given you every
		reason to take the gdc seriously
		but im gonna give you one more if
		you dont live up to the deal you
		just made come new hampshire were
		gonna go shopping for a new candidate

	sydney heads for the door

				shepherd
		you cant do that sydney

				sydney
		with all due respect mr president
		whos gonna stop me

				shepherd
		well if you go through that door
		the united states secret service
		thats my private office
			      pointing

	something he does almost as well as being president aj
	stands to the side with his pool cue

				aj
		mcsorley mccluskey and shane know
		were making our move on the crime
		bill theyre circling the wagons on
		the assault weapons

				shepherd
		should i meet with them

				aj
		let lewis take a pass at them first

				shepherd
		fine 2 in the side

	shepherd sends the twoball flying into the corner pocket

				aj
		nice shot mr president

				shepherd
		nice shot mr president you wont
		call me by my name when were playing
		pool

	aj assesses the table

				aj
		i will not do it playing pool i will
		not do it in a school i do not like
		green eggs and ham i do not like
		them sam i am

				shepherd
		at ease aj and get away from the
		pocket 9 in the corner

	shepherd makes the shot

				aj
		leo solomon phoned he said he was
		thrilled with the deal you made this
		morning

	shepherd lifts his cue for a momenttrying to think it
	there was something he was supposed to tell aj

				shepherd
		i forgot to tell you

				aj
		its a waste of time

				shepherd
		not our time gdc makes a big
		push for the votes and when they
		come up short we move in with the
		softer bill to get passed were
		everybodys hero 3 in the side

				aj
		also sydney wade called

	shepherd a hair too excited by this news misses by a mile

				shepherd
		sydney wade

				aj
			   beat
		she wanted to apologize one more time
		for her behavior 3 in the side

				shepherd
		did she say anything about me

				aj
			   beat
		sydney wade

				shepherd
		when she called

				aj
		did she say anything about you
		13 in the corner

				shepherd
		no its just that we had a nice
		couple of minutes together she
		threatened me and i patronized her
		and we didnt have anything to eat
		but i thought there was a connection

	aj is staring at him in disbelief

				shepherd
		she didnt say anything about me

				aj
			quietly
		well no but i could pass her a note
		before study hall and

				shepherd
		tell me this hypothetically what
		would happen

				aj
		i feel a nightmare coming on 1 in
		the corner

	he misses the shot

				shepherd
		if i called sydney and asked her
		to be my date at the state dinner
		thursday night

				aj
		youre not serious

				shepherd
		dont i sound serious

				aj
		the president cant just go out on
		a date

				shepherd
		why not jefferson did wilson did

				aj
		youre not

				shepherd
		wilson was widowed during his first
		term he meets a woman named edith
		gault he dated her courted her
		married her and somewhere in there
		managed to form the league of nations

				aj
		mr president this is an election
		year if youre looking for female
		companionship we can make
		arrangements thatll insure total
		privacy and

				shepherd
		i dont want you to get me a girl
		aj what is this vegas

				aj
		no sir this is the white house

				shepherd
		and im talking about something
		that in no way is at conflict with
		my oath of office im a single
		adult and i met a woman that id
		like to see again socially hows
		that different from what wilson did

				aj
		the difference is he didnt have to
		be the president on television
		youve said it a million times
		if there were a television set in every
		living room 60 years ago this country
		does not elect a man in a wheelchair

				shepherd
		what are you saying

				aj
		well take a hit

				shepherd
		how big

				aj
		i dont know five points maybe
		more

				shepherd
		five points were standing here
		talking about!

				aj
		it could be more

				shepherd
		i drop five points when wisconsin
		doesnt make it to the rose bowl
		5 in the corner

				aj
		do you want me to have kodak put
		together some numbers so we know
		what were talking about

				shepherd
		yeah
			   beat
		no no i dont want to check a
		polling sample to see if this is
		okay like im asking permission
		to stay out an hour past curfew
		this isnt the business of the
		american people

				aj
		mr president the american people
		have a funny way of deciding on
		their own what is and what is not
		their business

				shepherd
		i like her aj
			   pause
		stop being my chief of staff for one
		minute

				aj
			   beat
		give her a call

				shepherd
			   calling out
		janie!

				shepherd
		sydney you didnt dissolve the nato

				sydney
		i just said that were sitting in this

		wondered why nobody was dancing

				dastier
		and i informed ms wade that in my
		country a guest at the palace of
		louis xvi and marie antoinette would
		soon find their head in a guillotine
		if they made the impertinent gesture
		of dancing without so much as a
		byyourleave from the king and the queen

				aj
		ill bet no one accused louis of
		being soft on crime

				sydney
		theres a lesson there mr president

				shepherd

		thats not what i

				shepherd
		i didnt think so listen

				sydney
		ive really enjoyed the time weve
		spent together but this has
		catastrophe written all over it
		please mr president dont pursue
		me outside the political arena

				shepherd
		well i have no intention of pursuing
		you inside the political arena so
		that leaves everything out and
		thats unacceptable to me

				sydney
		if i were on your staff i would tell
		you that the absolute worst thing you
		can do coming into an election year
		is to open yourself up to character
		attacks and the fastest way to do
		that is to prance around like the
		playboy of the western world

				shepherd
		lets clear up a couple of things
		number 1 i seldom prance
		number 2 i have no intention of
		engaging in a character debate and
		number 3 youre not on my staff

				sydney
		yes of course but if youll follow
		the immutable

				shepherd
		why is that by the way

				sydney
		whys that

				shepherd
		why arent you on my staff

				sydney
		you cant afford me

				shepherd
		how much do you make

				sydney
		more than you do mr president

				shepherd
		the names andy how much money do
		you make

				sydney
		what the hell does it matter how
		much money i

				shepherd
		you would raise your voice to the
		president

				sydney
		im only thinking about the health
		of your presidency you think this
		mornings press conference was the
		end of it bob rumsons gotta be
		drooling over this

				shepherd
		are you attracted to me

				sydney
		i beg your pardon

				shepherd
		i asked if

				sydney
			    of course she is
		thats not the issue

				shepherd
		well i tell you what lets make
		it the issue lets try something
		new cause i know that most couples
		when theyre first getting together
		are inclined to slam on the brakes
		because theyre concerned about bob
		rumsons drool

				sydney
		youre not most people

				shepherd
		you know what your problem is

				sydney
		whats my problem

				shepherd
		sex and nervousness

				sydney
		sex and nervousness is my problem

				shepherd
		yes last night when we were
		looking at the different place
		settings in the dish room i
		realized that those place settings
		were provided by the first ladies
		and ill bet none of those first
		ladies were nervous about having
		sex with their president husbands
		and you know why

				sydney
		no but im sure youll explain it
		to me

				shepherd
		i will because they werent
		presidents when they met them not
		the case here

				sydney
		ahhhhhh

				shepherd
		you see what im getting at

				sydney
		yes may i use your bathroom for a
		moment

				shepherd
		sure its right through there

				sydney
		i want to freshen up

				shepherd
		as you pass through youll see a
		large closet on your left and if
		you feel comfortable hang up your
		coat and when you come back ill
		have fixed up a drink well sit on
		the couch and i will explain to
		you my plan

				sydney
		you have a plan dont make me
		wait youre on a roll

	sydney disappears into the bathroom/dressing room area
	shepherd keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a
	couple of drinks

				shepherd
			   speaking up
		okay youre attracted to me but
		the idea of physical intimacy is
		uncomfortable because you only know
		me as the president its not always
		gonna be that way and the reason i
		know that is because there was a
		moment last night when you were with
		me and not the president and i know
		what a big step that was for you
		so sydney im in no rush heres
		my plan were gonna slow down
		when youre comfortable thats
		when itll happen

	sydney comes back into the roomshes wearing one of
	shepherds dress shirts and nothing else she walks toward
	him

				shepherd
			   continuing
		perhaps i didnt properly explain
		the fundamentals of the slow down
		plan

				sydney
		you explained it great

	she moves closer to him

				shepherd
			   pause
		are you nervous

				sydney
		no

				shepherd
		good my nervousness exists on
		several levels number 1  and
		this is in no particular order 
		i havent done this in a pretty
		long time number 2 any expectations
		you might have due to the fact that
		im you know

				sydney
		the most powerful man in the world

				shepherd
		exactly thank you just so you
		remember thats a political
		distinction that comes with the
		office i mean if eisenhower were
		here instead of me hed be dead by
		now and number three

				lewis
		she you meant it didnt you

				aj
		lewis shut up

	theres a horrible silence in the room shepherd has locked
	eyes with lewis

				shepherd
		you got something to say to me

				lewis
		respectfully sir i think we should
		examine the new poll for more than
		its value as a box score

				shepherd
		examine what they dont like that
		im going out with sydney

				lewis
		its not that simple sir i think
		this poll helps bribg a murky problem
		into specific relief

				shepherd
		whose problem we talking about
		lewis yours you worried about
		your job this poll isnt talking
		about my presidency this poll is
		talking about my life two hundred
		and sixtyfour million people have
		decided

				lewis
		mr president two hundred and sixty
		four million people dont give a damn
		about your life they give a damn about
		their own

				aj
		all right thats enough

				lewis
		mr president youve raised a
		daughter almost entirely on your own
		and shes terrific what does it say
		to you that in the last seven weeks
		59 percent of this country has begun
		to question your family values

				aj
		the president doesnt answer to you
		lewis

				lewis
		oh yes he does aj  im a citizen
		this is my president and in this
		country it is not only permissible to
		question our leaders it is our
		responsibility but you already know
		that mr president because you have
		a deeper love of this country than
		any man ive ever known and i want
		to know what it says to you that in
		the past seven weeks 59 percent of
		americans have begun to question your
		patriotism

				shepherd
		look if people want to listen to bob
		rumson

				lewis
		they dont have a choice! rob
		rumsons the only one doing the
		talking people want leadership
		and in the absence of genuine
		leadership they will listen to
		anyone who steps up to the
		microphone they want leadership
		mr president theyre so thirsty
		for it theyll crawl through the
		desert toward a mirage and when
		they discover theres no water
		theyll drink the sand

				shepherd
			   evenly
		lewis weve had presidents who were
		beloved who couldnt find a coherent
		sentence with two hands and a
		flashlight people dont drink the
		sand cause theyre thirsty lewis
		they drink it cause they dont know
		the difference

		youll call him you mean youll

			   pause
		politically

				lucy
		yes

				shepherd
			   pause
		what do you mean

	it just starts spilling out in a stream

				lucy
		yes okay yes sometimes i mean
		im not sure you know a lot more
		than i do  but still i have these
		feelings and i dont think theyre
		wrong like okay for instance im
		not so sure its all right to burn a
		flag i mean it really bothers a lot
		of people and i dont know why you
		think its okay i hear senator
		rumson talk and some of the things
		he says sounds right to me and i
		think god am i like bob rumson!
		i mean dad thinks hes a jerk dad
		hates this guy!
		why am i agreeing with him and then
		i think well maybe im not really
		like bob rumson but maybe im not
		like dad either but the point is
		im the presidents kid and people
		pay attention to what i say and if
		i say something different from what
		you say itll be embarrassing for
		you so i cant just get up in social
		studies class and say whatever i want

	shepherd is silenttotally blown awayhe had absolutely
	no idea

	he stands up slowly and moves toward herlucy doesnt know
	whats coming

				shepherd
			   quietly
		stand up please

	lucy gets up slowly

	shes never seen her father like this

				shepherd
			   continuing
		i want you to pay very close
		attention to what happens now

	shepherd knees down cups her daughters face in his hands
	and gently kisses her forehead he pulls her to him and
	holds her in a tight embrace

				shepherd
			   continuing
		in your  lifetime you will never
		embarrass me it could never happen
		youre not the presidents daughter
		lucy youre mine
		and no ones gonna vote me out of
		that job youre my daughter and
		everything else is a distant second
			   more
		school is for you lucy you say
		what you want the only thing you
		have to do to make me happy is
		come home at the end of the day

	lucy squeezes her dad tightthey hold the embrace for a
	long moment

				shepherd
			   continuing
		one more thing i dont dislike
		senator rumson because of his
		political views and even if you
		voted for everything he would vote
		for that wouldnt make you like him
		theres a fundamental difference
	between you and the bob rumsons of
		the world

				lucy
		whats that

				shepherd
		the difference is that he says he
		loves america saying you love
		america is easy what takes
		character  and this is what you
		have

	shepherd trails off realizing hes about to quote sydney

				shepherd
			   continuing
		what takes character is loving
		americans
			   beat

	and now its as if shepherd is waking himself up from the
	longest trip of his life

	he looks over at the tv monitorno comment
	no i dont know how many other ways i can say it the
	white house isnt getting involved in

				shepherd
			   continuing
		luce i gotta go

				lucy
		dad is everything all right

				shepherd
		everythings fine im just a little
		late for work

	he heads for the door shouting out as he goes

				shepherd
		somebody get my daughter some food!
		the girls from wisconsin for cryin
		out loud!

	and hes gone as we

		question about being a member of

	but instead of hands going up the press corps suddenly
	stands robin turns to see shepherd stride in and step up to
	the podium

				shepherd
		yes he will morning

				robin
		good morning mr president

	shepherd takes the podium theres a palpable buzz in the
	room as video operators adjust their equipment etc people
	starts to stand

				shepherd
		thats all right you can keep your
		seats for the last couple of
		months senator rumson has suggested
		that being president of this country
		was to a certain extent about
		character

	angle  robin

	whos picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in
	four numbers

	she turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the
	rest of the room

				robin
			   into phone
		lewiscall aj and come on down
		herei dont know but
		somethings happening

				shepherd
		and although i have not been
		willing to engage in his attacks on
		me ive been here three years and
		three days and i can tell you
		without hesitation being president
		of this country is entirely about
		character

	lewis enters with aj and kodak

				shepherd
			   continuing
		for the record yes i am a card
		carrying member of the aclu but
		the more important question is why
		arent you bob this is an
		organization whose sole purpose is to
		defend the bill of rights so it
		naturally begs the questions

				shepherd
			   continuing
		why would a senator his partys most
		powerful spokesman and a candidate
		for president choose to reject
		upholding the constitution if you
		can answer that question then
		folks youre smarter than i am
		because i didnt understand it until
		a couple of minutes ago everybody
		knows american isnt easy america is
		advanced citizenship

				shepherd
			   continuing
		you gotta want it bad cause its
		gonna put up a fight its gonna
		say you want free speech lets
		see you acknowledge a man whose words
		make your blood boil whos standing
		center stage and advocating at the
		top of his lungs that which you
		would spend a lifetime opposing at the
		top of yours you want to claim
		this land as the land of the free
		then the symbol of your country cant
		just be a flag the symbol also has
		to be one of its citizens exercising
		his right to burn that flag in
		protest show me that defend that
		celebrate that in your classrooms
		then you can stand up and sing about
		the land of the free ive known bob
		rumson for years ive been operating
		under the assumption that the reason
		bob devotes so much time and energy to
		shouting at the rain was that he simply
		didnt get it well i was wrong

				shepherd
			   continuing
		bobs problem isnt that he doesnt
		get it bobs problem is that he
		cant sell it nobody has ever won
		an election by talking about what i
		was just talking about

				shepherd
			   continuing
		this is a country made up of people
		with hard jobs that theyre terrified
		of losing the roots of freedom are
		of little or no interest to them at
		the moment we are a nation afraid
		to go out at night were a society
		that has assigned low priority to
		education and has looked the other
		way while our public schools have
		been decimated we have serious
		problems to solve and we need
		serious men to solve them and
		whatever your particular problem is
		friend i promise you bob rumson is
		not the least bit interested in
		solving it he is interested in two
		things and two things only making
		you afraid of it and telling you
		whos to blame for it that ladies
		and gentlemen is how you win
		elections you gather a group of
		middleaged middleclass middle
		income voters who remember with
		longing an easier time and you talk
		to them about family and american
		values and personal character then
		you have an old photo of the
		presidents girlfriend you scream
		about patriotism and you tell them
		shes to blame for their lot in life
		you go on television and you call her
		a whore sydney ellen wade has done
		nothing to you bob she has done
		nothing but put herself through law
		school prosecute criminals for five
		years represent the interests of
		public school teachers for two years
		and lobby for the safety of our
		natural resources

				shepherd
			   continuing
		you want a character debate fine
		but you better stick with me cause
		sydney ellen wade is way out of your
		league ive loved two women in my
		life i lost one to cancer and i
		lost the other cause i was so busy
		keeping my job i forgot to do my job
		well that ends right now

				shepherd
			   continuing
		tomorrow morning the white house is
		sending a bill to congress for its
		consideration its white house
		resolution 455 an energy bill
		requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
		emission of fossil fuels over the
		next ten years it is by far the
		most aggressive stride ever taken in
		the fight to reverse the effects of
		global warming the other piece of
		legislation is the crime bill as of
		today it no longer exists im
		throwing it out im throwing it out
		and writing a law that makes sense
		you cannot address crime prevention
		without getting rid of assault
		weapons and handguns
		i consider them a threat to national
		security and i will go door to door
		if i have to but im gonna convince
		americans that im right and im
		gonna get the guns weve got
		serous problems and we need serious
		men and if you want to talk about
		character bob youd better come at
		me with more than a burning flag and
		a membership card if you want to
		talk about character and american
		values fine just tell me where and
		when and ill show up this is a
		time for serious men bob and your
		fifteen minutes are up my names
		andrew shepherd and i am the
