					   ash
			   why would you say that i am
			   insane  i wouldnt say that ive
			   lost my mind simply because ive
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods if anything i think more
			   clearly now than ever before i
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living evil a dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know but
			   between them in the dark in the
			   night and it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and i a chance at
			   warm life on this earth it
			   doesnt care that is already had
			   that chance once now listen
			   closely because there isnt much
			   time listen and believe because
			   its all true
