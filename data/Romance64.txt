          hazel grace lancaster 16 lies in the grass staring up at
          the stars were close on her face and we hear

           hazel vo
           you have a choice in this world i
           believe about how to tell sad
           stories

          cut to a series of quick images
           hazel and the boy we will come to know as augustus gus
          waters 17 at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place
          [they look very much like the perfect hollywood couple]

           hazel vo
           on the one hand you can sugar coat
            the way they do in movies and
           romance novels

           perfect hazel and perfect gus sit on a bench
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country
          she rests her head on his shoulder

           hazel vo
           where villains are vanquished
           and heroes are born and
           perfect hazel and perfect gus kiss in a dark room

           hazel vo
            beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons

           perfect hazel and perfect gus fall onto a bed together
          they look deep into one anothers eyes

           hazel vo
            and nothing is too messed up
           that cant be fixed with an apology
           and a peter gabriel song

          back to hazel on the grass still watching the stars were
          those dreams or were they memories still unclear

           hazel vo
           i like that way as much as the next
           girl believe me its just not the
           truth

          hazel closes her eyes

           hazel vo
           this is the truth
          and everything goes black we hear

           hazel vo

           late in the winter of my 17th
           year

          there are however some key and obvious differences
          first youll notice the oxygen tube in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe

          second youll notice her hair  which we couldnt see in the
          grass its much shorter than the perfect version the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before

           the booklets and web sites always
           list depression as a side effect of

          middle of the afternoon her mom brings her a sandwich a
          glass of water and then a whole host of prescription meds
          hazel eyes them with indifference

           excuse me
          with the beautiful boy watching a wan smile on his face
          hazel shuffles off as fast as she can ducking into

                         

          int bathroom  same
          hazel catches her breath shakes her head surprised at

          int church basement  later
          hazel sits in the circle of sick

                          patrick
           who would like to begin
          no volunteers hazel catches sight of the beautiful boy
          sitting next to isaac he seems to be watching her that same

           in a couple weeks after which
           well ill be blind
          hazel tries to focus on what isaacs saying but its
          difficult she still feels the beautiful boys gaze on her

          as isaac shares the beautiful boy doesnt look away from
          hazel hazel finds this intimidating and intimidation
          irritates her so she decides to play the game with him
          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly
          a staring contest

                          isaac
           my girlfriend helps and friends

                          patrick
           and does your friend want to speak
          this causes the beautiful boy to momentarily look away aha

          as if to say victory is mine! he smiles back at her the
          most radiant smile on the planet he turns back to the group

           would uh anyone like to speak to
           that

          hazel stands takes a second to gather her thoughts augustus
          watches her waits for it

                          hazel
           i just wanna say there will come
           a time when you know all of us
           are dead
          gus is now even more fixed on her than before

           12

                         

                          hazel
           it might be tomorrow might be a
           million years from now but its
           gonna happen and when it does
           enough generations will come and
           go therell be no one left to
           remember cleopatra or mozart or
           muhammad ali let alone any of us
           right
          the look on guss face is unreadable

                          hazel
           oblivions inevitable and if that
           scares you well i suggest you
           ignore it god knows its what
           everyone else does
          a beat and then an enormous smile spreads across guss face
          not a flirty smile but a surprised one a real one cut to

                         

          ext outside the church  later
          hazel waits for her moms car to appear
          across the parking lot she sees isaac going at it with a
          redhead monica 17 sucking face like theres no tomorrow
          against the door of her green pontiac firebird between
          kisses we can hear

                          isaac monica
          always always

                         
          and hazel hears

                          gus
           literally
          hazel turns to find the beautiful boy augustus standing
          right next to her

                          gus
           i thought we were in a church
           basement but apparently we were
           literally in the heart of jesus
          hazel smiles

                          hazel
           someone should probably tell him
           dont you think jesus seems kinda
           dangerous keeping all these kids
           with cancer in your heart
          gus laughs

                          gus

          hazel is taken aback no ones ever said that to her before

                          gus
           i enjoy looking at beautiful people
           and i decided a while back not to
           deny myself the simpler pleasures
           of existence particularly given
           that as you so astutely pointed
           out were all gonna die pretty
           soon

                          hazel

                          hazel
           you could be an axe murderer

                          gus

                          beat
           come on hazel grace take a risk
          as hazel mulls this over gus reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out of all things a pack of cigarettes! hazel is in
          disbelief he flips the box open puts a cigarette between
          his lips

                          hazel
           oh my god oh my god youre
           kidding right

           idiot! theres always a hamartia
           isnt there and yours is  even
           though you had freaking cancer you
           give money to a corporation for the
           chance to acquire even more
           cancer! ugh and you were doing so
           well
          as she rants gus continues to look at her with that smile on
          his face hazel does not find it so amusing

                          hazel
           let me tell you not being able
           to breathe sucks totally sucks

                          gus
           hamartia
          hazel folds her arms and turns away from him

                          hazel
           a fatal flaw
          gus takes a beat and then moves to face her the smile still
          etched on his face

                          gus
           they dont hurt you unless you
           light them

                          hazel

                          gus
           ive never lit one
          hazel turns back to him

                          gus
           its a metaphor see you put the
           thing that kills you between your
           teeth but you dont give it the
           power to do the killing
          hazel is floored and impressed

                          hazel
           metaphor
          gus holds her gaze and its at this point frannie pulls up

                          frannie
           hi sweetheart ready for some
           model

          hazel looks at gus cigarette dangling from his lips cool as
          anything handsome as hell she looks back at her mom

                          hazel

          and with that she walks off frannie looks at the boy with
          the cigarette in his mouth this could be trouble or
          awesome or both and we cut to

                         

          int guss car  later
          hazel is terrified turns out gus is the worlds worst
          driver when he brakes her body flies forward against the
          seatbelt and when he hits the gas seconds later her neck
          snaps back in the seat gus sees the look on her face

                          gus
           i failed the test a couple times

                          hazel

                          gus

          another brake forces hazel against the seat belt

                          gus
           the fourth time i took the test
           it was going about how this is
           going and when it was over the
           instructor looks at me and goes
           your driving while unpleasant
           is not technically unsafe

                          hazel

                          gus
           total cancer perk

                          gus
           so what happened to you
          hazel takes a deep breath shes told this story before but
          somehow this seems different

           17

                         

                          hazel

           how ya doing isaac
          again no response hazel looks to gus for an explanation

                          gus
           seems isaac and monica are no
           longer a going concern

                          hazel
           oh im sorry

                          beat
           do you want to talk about it
          isaac starts to sob again

           26

                         

                          gus
           he just wants to cry and play video
           games

                          hazel
           fair enough

                          gus
           it doesnt hurt to talk to him
           however if you have any sage words
           of feminine advice

                          hazel
           i actually think his response is
           appropriate

                          gus
           pain demands to be felt

                          hazel
           lights up at that
           youre quoting my book!
          gus winks at her at which point isaac lets out another
          howl gus gestures for hazel to sit the two of them flank
          isaac he finally speaks

                          isaac
           she didnt want to do it after the
           surgery said she couldnt handle
           it im about to lose my eyesight
           and she cant handle it
          hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy

                          isaac
           i kept saying always to her
           always always always and she
           just kept talking over me and not
           saying it back it was like i was
           already gone you know always
           was a promise! you cant break
           promises

                          hazel
           sometimes people dont understand
           the promises theyre making when
           they make them

                          isaac
           right sure but you keep the
           promise anyway thats what love
           is love is keeping the promise
           anyway

                          gus
           that could be an encouragement
          its silent for a beat and then isaac stands up a funny
          look on his face

           27

                         

                          gus
           isaac
          suddenly isaac starts kicking his chair across the room

                          gus
           here we go
          the chair lands against the bed gus hands isaac something
          else to throw a pillow isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
          against the wall he dives on it and beings pummeling the
          pillow like a maniac

                          gus
           thats it! punch that thing
          and so he does as he continues to gus looks at hazel
          cigarette dangling from his mouth

                          gus
           ive been wanting to call you on a
           nearly minutely basis but i have
           been waiting until i could form a
           coherent thought in re an
           imperial affliction

                          she smiles
           i cant stop thinking about it

                          hazel
           i know right

                          gus
           the only problem is the ending

                          hazel
           it is rather abrupt

                          gus
           its torture! i mean i totally get
           that she died or whatever  anna
           but there is an unwritten contract
           between author and reader and i
           think ending your book in the
           middle of a sentence kind of
           violates that contract

                          hazel
           but thats part of what i like
           about it it portrays death
           truthfully you die in the middle
           of your life in the middle of a
           sentence but i do  god i do want
           to know what happens to everyone
           else

                          gus
           yeah like her mom

                          hazel
           the dutch tulip man

                          gus
           sysiphus the hamster
          hazel beams gus totally gets the book a bond between them

                          gus
           have you tried contacting this
           peter van houten

                          hazel
           ive written letters hes never
           responded apparently he moved to
           amsterdam became a recluse hasnt
           published anything doesnt do

                          gus
           sad

                          beat
           hang on
           turns to isaac
           isaac!
          gus stands and takes the pillow out of isaacs hand

                          gus
           pillows dont break
          gus hands isaac one of his basketball trophies

                          gus
           you need to break something
          isaac looks at it then back to gus as if asking permission
          gus nods isaac holds it over his head and smash! the trophy
          breaks into a million pieces isaac almost smiles gus hands
          him another

                          gus
           go to town my friend
          and isaac does smashing them one by one hazel looks at gus

                          gus
           ive been looking for a way to tell
           my dad that i kinda hate
           basketball think maybe weve found
           it
          isaac grabs more of the trophies smashing them to pieces
          gus and hazel enjoy the spectacle when there are none left
          isaac is panting standing over the bronze carnage

                          gus
           feel better
          isaac thinks about it shakes his head no gus puts his arm
          around him but looks at hazel

           29

                         

                          gus
           thats the thing about pain it
           demands to be felt
          hazel smiles and on her face we cut to

                         

          int lancaster house  dining room  another night
          where hazel is having dinner with her parents

          hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow cut to

                         

          int hazels bedroom  later that night
          hazel sits at her computer van houtens assistants email
          address staring her in the face the cursor blinks on a blank
          page and then hazel starts writing

           hazel vo
           dear mr peter van houten my name
           is hazel grace lancaster my friend
           augustus waters who read your book
            at my recommendation  just
           received an email from you at this
           address i hope you will not mind
           that he shared that email with me

           32

                         
          while hazel reads the letter we see a series of scenes
          showing the next several days they include
           hazel and gus drinking coffees at a cafe hes
          enthusiastically telling a story and shes enjoying every
          moment of it
           hazel helping gus become a better driver its no use

           hazel vo
           i was wondering if you wouldnt
           mind answering a few questions i
           have about what happens after the
           end of the book specifically the

                          following
           in his kitchen laughing trying to make omelettes

           hazel vo
           does annas mom marry the dutch
           tulip man is the dutch tulip man
           up to something  or is he just
           misunderstood what happens to
           annas friends
           watching tv their bodies almost touching but not quite

           hazel vo
           lastly i was hoping you could shed
           some light on sisyphus the hamster
           these questions have haunted me for
           years and i dont know how long i
           have left to get answers to them
          and finally back in hazels bedroom she finishes reading
          this letter into the phone

                          hazel
           i know these are not important
           literary questions and that your
           book is full of important literary
           questions but i would just really
           like to know
          intercut w/ gus bouncing a ball against the wall listening

                          hazel
           reading it aloud to him
           and of course if ever you do
           decide to write anything else even
           if you dont want to publish it
           id love to read it frankly id
           read your grocery lists yours with
           great admiration hazel grace
           lancaster age 16

                          gus
           not bad

                          hazel
           you think

                          gus
           bit pretentious but then again
           van houten uses words like
           tendentious and bacchanalia
           so i think hell like it
          hazel smiles looks at a clock

                          hazel
           is it really almost 1

                          gus
           guess so

                          hazel
           i gotta get to sleep

                          gus
           ok

                          hazel
           ok
          neither one of them want to hang up the phone

                          gus
           ok

                          hazel
           ok
          they both laugh at this

                          gus
           perhaps ok will be our always
          hazel smiles

                          hazel
           ok

                          gus

           doesnt pun your disability

                          hazel
           gets blood on the first try

                          isaac

           needle now so there might be a
           little ouchie

                          hazel
           you doing alright isaac

                          isaac

           than my eye is that crazy thats
           crazy

                          hazel

           35

                         

                          isaac
           but i believe in love you know i
           dont believe that everybody gets
           to keep their eyes or not get sick
           or whatever but everybody should
           have true love dont you think
          hazel thinks about it as isaac presses the button on his pain
          pump selfadministering morphine

                          isaac
           gus was here earlier

                          hazel
           trying to be nonchalant
           was he
          isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in

                          isaac
           mmm thats better

                          hazel
           the pain
           off his slow nod
           good good isaac
           isaac closes his eyes
           what about gus
          but isaac is already asleep whatever he was going to say
          about gus is gone hazel nods pats his hand cut to

                         

          int hazels bedroom  morning
          hazel rolls out of bed stumbles to her computer she
          casually checks her inbox and is shocked to discover  hes
          written her back!

                          hazel
           holy shit!

                          reading aloud
           dear ms lancaster i cannot
           answer your questions at least not
           in writing because to do so would
           constitute a sequel which you
           might publish or otherwise share on
           the internet not that i dont
           trust you but how could i trust
           you i barely know you
          hazels jaw hangs open as she reads the next part

          hazel laughs elbows him

                          hazel
           youre not a virgin
           off his look
           are you really
          gus picks a stick up from the dirt draws a big circle in it

                          gus
           see this this circle is virgins
          now gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle

                          gus
           and this is 17 year old dudes
           with one leg
          hazel laughs point made he grabs her hand helps her walk
          up a tiny hill once up there gus lays a blanket on the
          ground they sit looking out over a rather odd sculpture  a
          set of giant white bones where children can jump and play

                          gus

                          explaining

           he sounds dutch

                          gus
           and he is much like rik smits and
           tulips
          hazel raises an eyebrow at gus hes sure taking this
          amsterdam/dutch thing pretty far he removes some sandwiches
          and orange juice out of a basket

          gus stands up takes a cigarette puts it in his mouth he
          clears his throat

                          gus

           cheese sandwich and drinking orange

           jersey

                          gus
           you were young impressionable the
           grim reaper staring you in the
           face and the fear of dying with
           your one true wish left ungranted
           led you to rush into making one you
           didnt really want for how could
           little hazel grace having never
           read an imperial affliction ever
           know that her one true wish was to

          hug their faces close lips inches apart and just when it
          looks like something might happen

           its too much haze we cant
           accept something like that from a
           virtual stranger

                          hazel

           just dont know how long itll stay
           that way what if you get sick in a
           foreign country

                          hazel

           cancer someone will know what to
           do

           44

                         

           dr maria

           familiar with your particular case

                          hazel
           turns to her mom

           loaded

                          frannie

                          i

           black
          over which we hear

           hazel vo
           and then this happened

                         

          int hazels bedroom  night
          [note theres no sound in this sequence just images]
          hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night shaking
          and holding her head
          frannie and michael burst in mom grabs her crying daughter
          frightened beyond belief waves to michael to call for help

           hazel vo
           people talk about the courage of
           cancer patients and i do not deny
           that courage
          he leaves the room to do so and fran stays behind rocking
          with her daughter promising her itll all be ok whatever
          nightmare this is its going to end cut to

                         

          int frannies car  moments later
          still silent michael drives trying to keep it together
          frannies in the back with hazels head in her lap

           45

                         
          hazel continues to scream in silence whether from pain or
          terror we do not know

           hazel vo
           id been poked and stabbed and
           poisoned for years and still i trod
           on

                         

          int emergency room  moments later
          michael carries hazel into the chaotic emergency room
          theyre practically running theres still no sound

           hazel vo
           but make no mistake
          the doctors rally to assist the screaming crying child
          shes wheeled away from her family who can only watch we
          stay with her and we hear

           hazel vo
           in that moment i would have been
           very very happy to die

          end sequence

                         

          int hospital room  icu  morning
          the sound returns and its the sound of a heart monitor
          beep beep beep its also the sound of a working heart
          hazel has made it through her eyes open a nurse is there

                          hazels nurse
           hello

                          hazel
           hi

                          hazels nurse
           youre ok hazel
          even hazel seems surprised by that

                          hazels nurse
           would you like to see your parents
          hazel nods the nurse goes to get them soon they come
          bounding in crying and kissing her repeatedly so much
          relief cut to
          later hazels bed has been raised up so she can talk to her
          parents comfortably

                          frannie
           they thought it was a brain tumor

                          michael
           it wasnt  thank god 

           46

                         

                          hazel
           so what happened

                          frannie
           the usual fluid in the lungs
           preventing oxygenation they put
           that in
          theres a tube in hazels side draining fluid into a plastic
          bladder that hangs off her bed

                          frannie
           drained a liter and a half last
           night
          thats a lot of fluid

                          michael
           the good news is no tumor
           growth no new tumors in your body
          hazel nods that is a relief

                          michael
           were all so relieved
          frannie embraces her daughter

                          frannie
           this is just a thing hazel its a
           thing we can live with
          hazel nods again only in the universe of hazel grace
          lancaster is something like this just a thing meanwhile

                         

          int hospital icu  waiting area  later
          heres gus his foot tapping nervously on the floor its
          unclear how long hes been waiting there he sees michael
          walk down the hall races after him

                          gus

                          michael
           better thank you much better
          gus nods as relieved as the rest of them

                          gus
           they wont let me in family only

                          michael

                          gus

           you tell her i was here

           47

                         

                          michael
           of course i will
          gus smiles and sits back down though he wont get to see
          her he still wants to stay

                          michael
           gus
          michael really likes this kid

                          michael
           why dont you go home get some
           rest
          gus looks up that might be for the best cut to

                         

          int hospital  conference room  days later
          hazel and her parents sit at a very large conference table
          along with dr maria and three other oncologists  her whole
          cancer team

                          oncologist #1
           the great news is phalanxifor
           continues to control your tumor
           growth

                          beat
           the not so great news is were
           still seeing serious problems with
           fluid accumulation

                          beat
           so how should we proceed
          silence hazel looks around the room waits for someone to
          answer no one does

                          hazel
           um i feel like im not the most
           qualified person to answer that

                          oncologist #1
           i was talking to dr simmons
          dr simmons late 60s white beard old school speaks next

           dr simmons
           its a strange case normally the
           tumors start resisting the
           treatment but that hasnt happened
           here  yet
          hazel hears the yet the loudest

           dr simmons
           unfortunately the drug may be
           worsening the edema

           48

                         

           dr maria
           but if we stopped it entirely
           were likely to face even graver
           dangers

                          michael
           so were gonna do nothing

           dr maria
           thats what we have to decide the
           truth is very few people have
           been on phalanxifor as long as
           hazel has we dont really know the
           long term effects
          that comforts no one

                          hazel
           cant i just get like a lung
           transplant or something
          the doctors look at one another like who wants to take that
          one eventually

           dr maria
           you would not be considered a
           strong candidate for a transplant
          hazel takes that in nods tries to pretend it didnt bother
          her sensitive michael on the other hand starts to cry a
          little bit he grabs frannies hand

           dr simmons
           were trying to prevent endothelial
           growth while at the same time
           preventing immunosorbent
          as dr simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook
          hazels eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents she hates
          what shes doing to them and seeing them holding hands
          crying but trying not to cry  it jogs a memory cut to

                         

          int hospital icu  flashback
          we saw this once before it looks like the end for 13year
          old hazel her father is weeping off to the side while her
          mom stands over her holding her hand and asking

                          frannie
           through the tears
           are you ready sweetie
          13year old hazel nods the doctors get to work the
          anaesthetic takes hold and hazel goes under but not enough
          cause she totally hears her mother say

                          frannie
           i wont be a mom anymore

           49

                         
          she falls into her husbands chest and were back to

                         

          int hospital  conference room
          hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
          staring at them she tries to shake it off dr simmons is
          still talking nonsense when

                          hazel
           i have a question

           dr maria
           yes hazel

                          hazel
           can i still go to amsterdam
          dr simmons cant help himself he laughs everyone looks at
          him he clears his throat

           dr simmons
           that would not be wise at this
           juncture

                          hazel
           why not

           dr simmons
           excuse me

                          hazel
           why not dr simmons

           dr simmons

                          i 
          the doctors are trying to be delicate here

           dr maria
           it would increase some risks 

                          hazel
           so does going to the mall 

           dr maria
           yes but an airplane

                          hazel
           they have oxygen on airplanes

                          frannie

                          hazel 

                          hazel
           its my life right

           dr simmons

           have again if the medicines
           working i dont see why 

           dr simmons

           say this youre just too sick
          and this is like a punch in the gut

          gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt
          hazel takes slow careful steps through the metal detector
          she seems determined to get through this without any help
          but upon reaching the other side its clear that even these
          few steps without oxygen were a struggle
          hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
          herself as soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
          back in place still lightheaded hazel closes her eyes and
          focuses on her breathing she catches her mom looking at her
          nervously

           before
          gus shakes his head he has not and hes nervous he pulls a
          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth within
          seconds a flight attendant rushes over

           him

          suddenly its as if theyre transported  not only to
          another universe but to another time as well
          we see multicolored row houses lined on both sides of a
          windy canal houseboats float against the edges and everyone
          rides bicycles down cobblestone streets theyre astounded

                          hazel

                          beat
           i wont accept it
          hazel thinks about it she appreciates his conviction but is
          still not sure she agrees the hand theyve been dealt too
          unfair hazel looks out at the water as she says

                          hazel
           i hope youre right

                          gus

           im in love with you and i know
           that love is just a shout into the
           void and that oblivion is
           inevitable and that were all
           doomed and that there will come a
           day when all our labor has been
           returned to dust and i know the
           sun will swallow the only earth

           more stars
          hazel is still too speechless to respond her eyes fixed on

          hazel leans into his body just a little they stay like
          that savoring the best night of both of their lives cut to

                          she doesnt
           all representations of a thing are
           inherently abstract a drawing of a
           thing is not the thing itself nor
           is a tshirt of a drawing of a
           thing the thing itself
          frannie is still at a loss but shes impressed

                          frannie
           when did you get so grown up i
           feel like it was yesterday i was
           telling 8year old hazel why the
           sky was blue you thought i was a
           genius back then

                          gus
           as opposed to other days
          she playfully hits him he takes her arm picks up the oxygen
          tank and up they go towards his front door
          as they approach theres a noticeable noise coming from
          inside the house its the deep thump of a bass beat loud
          like obnoxiously loud
          hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks they wait theres
          no response

                          gus
           maybe he cant hear over the music
          gus tries again this time with more force still nothing he
          tries a third time finally the music stops they wait
          still excited
          a moment later the door swings open
          its a man in pajamas 60s with a huge potbelly thinning
          hair and a weekold beard all he says is

           man in pajamas
           what!
          gus and hazel look to one another could it be

                          gus
           mr van houten
          at which point the pajama man slams the door in their faces
          hazel and gus are too stunned to react through the closed
          door they hear this

           man in pajamas os

           young fans with whom youve been

          help things take a turn for the better

           man in pajamas os

           i will not do this peter be nice
          at which point the door opens  opened by the woman whose
          voice theyd been hearing  van houtens assistant lidewij
          30s dutch pretty in a bookish way she virtually shoves
          van houten towards a stunned gus and hazel
          and they are again facetoface with van houten one beat
          two beats no one knows what to say finally

                          van houten
           which of you is augustus waters
          gus raises his hand tentatively
          van houten sizes them up without another word he turns and
          walks inside  at least this time leaving the door ajar

                          lidewij
           please i am sorry come in
          hazel and gus share one more awkward glance before gus takes
          a step hazel follows they walk

                         

          int van houtens home  same
          lidewij leads gus and hazel into a living room so sterile
          its creepy the walls are empty and white theres a single
          couch a small ottoman and a single lounge chair thats it
          van houten sits in the chair
          off to the side are two large black garbage bags full and
          twisttied

           fan mail 18 years worth he never
           opens it
          van houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
          slippers he motions for them to sit on the couch

                          van houten

           which ive replied and look where
           that got me
          hazel and gus take their seats

                          van houten
           scotch

                          hazel

                          van houten

           problem

                          lidewij
           i also think the earth is round
          nevertheless lidewij pours peter half a glass and hands it
          to him he takes a sip then sits up straight

                          van houten
           so you like my book

                          hazel

           meeting you his wish so that we
           could come here and talk to you
          van houten says nothing takes a long pull on his drink

                          van houten
           did you dress like her on purpose

                          hazel
           looks at her shirt
           kinda

           73

                         
          van houten says nothing to that

           govern england and do anything i
           want to do except not drink
          he glances over at lidewij who dutifully refills his glass

                          gus
           incidentally thank you for dinner
           last night

                          van houten

                          to lidewij
           we bought them dinner last night

                          lidewij
           it was our pleasure

                          van houten

                          sighs
           youve come a long way so what
           is it i can do for you

                          hazel
           we have some questions 

                          van houten
           uhhuh

                          hazel
           about what happens you know
           after the end of your book
           specifically to those who anna
           leaves behind like her mom the
           dutch tulip man sisy 

                          van houten

                          interrupting
           how familiar are you with swedish
           hiphop
          hazel looks at gus is he kidding

                          hazel
           i would say limited

                          van houten
           but presumably you know afasi och
           filthys seminal album flacken

                          gus
           um

                          van houten
           lidewij! play bomfalleralla
           immediately

           74

                         
          lidewij sighs but she does as shes told a few seconds
          later some loud swedish rap song blasts from the speakers
          hazel and gus sit through this totally baffled

                          hazel
           yelling over the music
           im sorry sir we dont speak
           swedish

                          van houten

                          yelling
           who the hell speaks swedish the
           important thing is not what
           nonsense the voices are saying but
           what the voices are feeling
          the song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
          gus has enough he gets up and turns off the music

                          gus
           are you messing with us

                          van houten
           pardon

                          gus
           is this some kind of performance

                          van houten
           rudolf otto said that if you had
           not encountered the numinous then
           his work was not for you and i say
           to you my friends if you cannot
           hear afasi och filthys bravadic
           response to fearfulness then my
           work is not for you
          hazel is really getting worried at this point they came all
          this way for this

                          hazel
           so anyway when the book ends
           annas mom 

                          van houten
           raising a hand to silence

                          her
           let us imagine that you are racing
           a tortoise
          hazel and gus fidget in their seats lidewij frowns clearly
          feeling bad for them van houten continues

                          van houten
           the tortoise has a ten yard head
           start in the time it takes you to
           run ten yards the tortoise has
           moved maybe one yard and so on
           forever

                          more

           75

           van houten contd
           you are faster than the tortoise
           but you can never catch him you
           see you can only decrease his
           lead now certainly you can run
           past the tortoise as long as you
           dont contemplate the mechanics
           involved but the question of how
           turns out to be so complicated that
           no one really solved it until
           cantors proof that some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities

           fictions they cease to exist the
           moment the novel is over

           on a roll
           you are fated to live out your days
           as the child you were when
           diagnosed the child who believes
           there is life after a novel ends
           and we as adults we pity this so
           we pay for your treatments for
           your oxygen machines we give you
           food and water though you are
           unlikely to live long enough 

                          lidewij

           peter!

                          van houten
           you are a side effect of an
           evolutionary process that cares
           little for individual lives

          they get to the street van houten has one more thing to say

                          van houten
           have you ever stopped to ask why
           you care so much about your silly
           questions

                          hazel
           go fuck yourself
          van houten doesnt have a response to that he just shuts the
          door and when he does thats when hazel gets emotional

                          gus
           hey its ok its ok

           guts and sacrifice youll love it
          hazel nods then wipes away tears she fakes a smile and gus
          gives her a hug afterwards

                          hazel
           i spent your wish on that asshole

                          gus

          outside clearly shes been crying too

           im so sorry circumstance has made
           him cruel i thought meeting you

           lives but im very sorry

           79

                         
          hazel says nothing gus holds her in a very protective way

                          lidewij
           perhaps we can do some sightseeing

           he is not invited

                         

          ext anne frank house  later
          lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news

                          lidewij
           im afraid theres no elevator

                          hazel

          hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
          today they are going inside cut to

                         

          int anne frank house  ground floor  moments later
          a video plays on a monitor showing the nazi invasion of
          holland hazel and gus stand with lidewij in a pack of
          backpackers and travelers about to take the tour many of
          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs

                          lidewij
           shall we
          hazel nods both hazel and gus walk slowly up the stairs so
          far so good they find themselves in an office space

                          lidewij
           this is the bookcase that hid the
           frank family and four others
          the bookcase is half open behind it is an even steeper set
          of stairs only wide enough for one person at a time

           80

                         
          some of the travelers begin to walk up the stairs gus looks
          at hazel  are you sure we should continue she begins the
          climb determined lidewij trails behind carrying her oxygen
          tank
          hazel moves very slowly we are aware of her labored
          breathing the entire time
          angle on other tourists watching and quietly commenting
          just like at the airport except now in foreign languages
          hazel arrives on the next floor  an empty room shes
          definitely starting to struggle she leans against the wall
          to catch her breath gus comes to her side wipes her brow

                          gus
           youre a champion
          hazel smiles when shes feeling up to it they walk into the
          next room also empty and another staircase even more
          narrow and steep  practically a ladder when gus sees this
          he looks at hazel

                          gus
           thats enough 

                          hazel

                          resolute
           im ok
          hazel very slowly begins the climb again were aware of her
          every breath its dark and its becoming very difficult
          near the top hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
          herself through
          once there she falls to the floor slumping against the
          wall trying to catch her breath gus crouches next to her

                          gus
           were at the top thats it
          hazel becomes aware that tourists look at her with concern
          she smiles stands up nothing to see here
          and now theyre in the final room  a long narrow hallway
          this is where anne frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
          for as long as they could theres a time line detailing
          their story

                          lidewij
           the only member of the whole family
           to survive was otto annes father
          gus takes hazels hand

                          lidewij
           i dont know how you go on without
           your family

           81

                         
          lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit gus leads
          hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a video
          details the last days of anne franks life over it we hear
          a young girls voice reading from the diary
          the travelers stand to watch and listen gus and hazel do the
          same the room is dark

           girls voice os
           at such moments i dont think
           about the misery
          gus and hazel stand very closely together the video is the
          cherry on top of a very emotional day hazel watches it

           girls voice os
           but about the beauty that still
           remains
          gus meanwhile is just watching hazel the same way she
          watched him on the airplane after a beat she catches him
          their eyes meet the emotions build

           girls voice os
           try to recapture the happiness
           within yourself think of all the
           beauty in everything around you
           and be happy
          and hazel kisses gus a most passionate intense youandme
          againsttheworld kind of kiss better than any theyve
          experienced or could even imagine it seems to last for a
          small eternity
          eventually they break away and open their eyes they quickly
          notice all the travelers staring at them for a brief second
          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do
          when suddenly everyone starts clapping for them moved by the
          whole thing one european even shouts bravo! hazel blushes
          gus smiles bows he grabs her hand cut to

                         

          int guss hotel room  later
          they fall onto guss bed kissing hazel is very in the
          moment and now its gus who seems nervous as they kiss

                          gus
           its above my knee
          she ignores him more kissing she takes off his shirt

                          gus
           it tapers a little and then its
           just skin 

                          hazel
           what

           82

                         
          hazel pulls away from him

                          gus
           my leg

                          beat
           just so youre prepared 

                          hazel
           oh get over yourself
          hazel kisses him again now he tries to pull her shirt off
          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube he cant figure
          it out eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them they
          shake their heads  laughing  certainly not your typical
          hollywood movie moment and yet for them

                          hazel

          they resume kissing and we cut to

                         

          int hotel room  morning
          gus wakes up in the bed he looks around for hazel but she
          isnt there on the bed is a piece of paper a note
          it reads dearest augustus
          beneath that is a big circle labeled virgins and in that
          circle is a smaller second circle labeled 17 year old dudes
          with one leg well notice part of that circle is now
          outside the bigger circle gus flashes that signature smile

           imagine

                          frannie
           and then what happened

                          hazel
           then we went to the anne frank
           museum

                          frannie
           and after that
          a quick glance between hazel and gus

                          hazel
           we just walked around
          hazel and gus smile thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
          in check in front of her mother

                          frannie
           sounds lovely
          a few beats later

           time to talk

                          hazel

                          thats weird
           um ok
          as she stands up to leave hazel thinks she catches gus and
          frannie making eye contact for a brief second once frannie
          has left them

                          hazel
           that was weird
          gus doesnt respond except to say

                          gus
           shall we

                         

          ext amsterdam street  later
          they start to walk gus takes a cigarette out of his pack
          sticks it between his lips hazel notices hes struggling
          with something

                          hazel

           84

                         

                          gus
           theres something i have to tell
           you
          they walk in silence a few beats

                          gus
           just before you went into the
           hospital there was this i
           felt this ache in my hip
          hazel grabs onto his arm a lump already forming

                          hazel
           oh no
          gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth clenches his teeth
          tightly trying not to cry

                          gus
           i had a pet scan
          gus sits down on a bench looks up at her tries to smile
          before he even says it she knows

                          gus
           it lit up like a christmas tree
           hazel

                          hazel
           oh god

                          gus
           the lining of my chest my liver
           everywhere

                          hazel
           oh my god no!
          hazel loses it in that moment falling on top of him hugging
          him for dear life her head in his lap

                          hazel
           im so sorry augustus im so so

                          sorry 

                          gus
           im sorry too 

                          hazel
           its so unfair 

                          gus
           i should have told you 

                          hazel
           its so fucking unfair!
          a beat gus still trying not to cry

           85

                         

                          gus
           apparently the world is not a
           wishgranting factory
          and at that point gus lets it go lets himself cry and be
          sad and feel awful
          but just for a second then he shakes it off pulls hazels
          face up to his tries again to smile through the tears

                          gus
           dont you worry about me hazel
           grace ill find a way to hang
           around and annoy you for a long
           time
          she hugs him perhaps a little too tightly he winces

                          hazel
           does it hurt

                          gus
           its ok

                          beat
           im ok

                          hazel

                          gus
           ok
          but of course its not ok not by a mile
          hazel takes a moment to look at him touches his cheek

                          gus
           what

                          hazel

          he grabs her hand and holds it

                          gus
           i dont suppose you can forget
           about it treat me like im not
           dying

                          hazel
           i dont think youre dying
           augustus youve just got a touch
           of cancer
          gus nods squeezes her hand

                          gus
           would it be absolutely ludicrous to
           make out right now

           86

                         
          hazel doesnt answer she just kisses him hard and on the
          two of them so in love we cut to

                         

          int airplane  later

          is allowed to ride with him in the back as the car starts

           one of the less bullshitty
           conventions of the cancer genre is
           the convention known as the last
           good day

                         

          ext guss house  another day

          his own bed he sleeps in a hospital bed set up in a guest
          room hazel is with him theyre watching sports on tv

           hazel vo
           this is where the victim of cancer

          ext guss backyard porch  another day
          hazel and gus getting some fresh air she sits there reading
          a book gus just sits there his eyes staring off into
          nothing hazel waves to him gus looks over as if waking
          from a dream she manages a smile he manages one back

            when it seems like the
           inexorable decline has suddenly
           plateaued when the pain is for a

          her food

           hazel vo
           the problem of course is that
           theres no way of knowing that your
           last good day is your last good
           day at the time its just
           another decent day

                          hazel
           looks around the room
           how did you even get in here

                          gus
           would you believe they leave the
           door open at night

                          hazel

                          gus
           as well you shouldnt
          he smiles and for a brief moment its old gus hazel laughs
          isaac clears his throat

                          isaac
           augustus waters was a self
           aggrandizing bastard but we
           forgive him we forgive him not
           because he had a heart as
           figuratively good as his actual one
           sucked or because he got 18 years
           when he should have gotten more

                          gus

           17

                          isaac
           im assuming youve got some time
           you interrupting bastard! i mean
           seriously
           back to the speech
           augustus waters talked so much
           that hed interrupt you at his own
           funeral and he was pretentious

                          more

           102

                          isaac contd
           sweet jesus that kid never took a
           piss without pondering the
           resonances of human waste
           production and he was vain but
           that comes with superhuman
           handsomeness
          gus nods  that part is true

                          isaac
           but i will say this when the
           scientists of the future show up at
           my house with robot eyes and they
           tell me to try them on i will tell
           the scientists to piss off because
           i dont even want to see a world
           without augustus waters
          hazel smiles  but its one that triggers an immediate
          emotional waterfall

                          isaac
           and then of course having made
           my rhetorical point i will put my
           robot eyes on because i mean
           robot eyes!
          gus has a big smile on his face

                          isaac
           so anyway augustus my friend
           godspeed
          gus nods a couple times

                          gus
           thank you isaac
          this causes isaac to lose it he clings to the lectern

                          isaac
           goddamn it gus

                          gus
           hey dont swear in the literal
           heart of jesus

                          isaac
           shit! ass! balls!
          isaac sighs wipes away the tears and another beat passes

                          isaac
           can i get a hand here hazel
          hazel remembers isaac cant see she rises goes up to get
          him walks him back to her seat

                          gus
           hazel grace its down to you

           103

                         
          hazel takes out a piece of paper walks up to the dais takes
          a beat to ready herself

                          hazel
           augustus waters was the great star
           crossed love of my life ours was
           an epic love story and i wont be
           able to get more than a sentence
           into it without disappearing into a
           puddle of tears

                          beat
           like all real love stories  ours
           will die with us as it should id
           hoped that hed be eulogizing me
           because theres no one id rather
           have
          and thats all she can get out before falling apart she lets
          it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together

                          hazel
           beat composing herself
           i cant talk about our love story
           so instead i will talk about math
           i am not a mathematician but i
           know this there are infinite
           numbers between 0 and 1 theres 1
           and 12 and 112 and an infinite
           collection of others of course
           there is a bigger infinite set of
           numbers between 0 and 2 or between
           0 and a million some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities a
           writer we used to like taught us
           that i want more numbers than im
           likely to get and god i want more
           numbers for augustus waters than he
           got but gus my love i cannot
           tell you how thankful i am for our
           little infinity you gave me a
           forever within the numbered days
           and for that i am eternally
           grateful i love you
          gus smiles nods and closes his eyes cut to

           black
          over which we hear a ringing telephone

                         

          int hazels bedroom  night
          hazel turns on the light by her bed her house phone is
          ringing and its 4am
          she knows instantly

           104

                         

           hazel vo
           augustus waters died eight days
           later in the icu
          hazels head falls into her chest

           hazel vo
            when the cancer which was made
           of him stopped his heart which
           was also made of him
          her bedroom door opens its frannie and michael this only
          confirms her worst fears she starts to cry her parents
          embrace her in the bed

           hazel vo
           it was unbearable the whole thing
           every second worse than the last

                         

          ext hazels house  driveway  same
          hazel sits in the car in the dark shes blaring the loudest
          music she can possibly blare  a means of drowning out the
          horrors of the world over which we hear this

           hazel vo
           one of the first things they ask
           you in the er is to rate your pain
           on a scale from 1 to 10 id been
           asked this question hundreds of
           times and i remember once early
           on when i couldnt catch my breath
           and it felt like my chest was on
           fire and the nurse asked me to
           rate the pain and though i couldnt
           speak i held up 9 fingers
          the loud music isnt protecting hazel as well as she hoped
          she falls apart nonetheless

           hazel vo
           later on when id been feeling
           better the nurse came in and she
           called me a fighter you know how
           i know she said because you
           called a ten a nine

                         

          int hazels bedroom  another morning
          hazel puts on her funeral dress she looks in the mirror

           hazel vo
           but that wasnt the truth the
           reason i called it a nine was i
           was saving my ten

           105

                         

          int church  day
          the place is filled today with mourners for augustus waters
          hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back
          watching people shes never seen before approach the waters
          family and extend their deepest condolences

           hazel vo
           and this was it the great and
           terrible ten
          when mr and mrs waters see hazel they open their arms

           mrs waters
           he loved you so much
          hazel nods hugs them back

                          hazel
           he loved you so much too
          more mourners approach the family leaving hazel stranded in
          the receiving line her eyes turn towards the coffin shes
          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
          breath wills herself to walk towards it
          gus is there in the same suit he wore to oranjee
          immediately hazel breaks down and immediately she catches
          herself

                          hazel
           its ok you hear me its ok
          she leans forward and kisses his cheek she looks around
          once in the clear she pulls out a hard pack of camel lights
          and sticks them in the space between gus and the lining of
          the coffin a minister approaches at that moment

                          minister
           i think were ready to begin
          hazel nods and walks back to her parents taking her seat in
          the middle of the room

                          minister
           augustus waters fought hard for
           many years his battle was a
           courageous one and his strength was
           a source of inspiration for each
           and every one of us
          hazel frowns this is all such bullshit and she hears

                          male voice
           what a load of shit eh kid
          hazel recognizes that voice but it doesnt make sense she
          turns around and sure enough its peter van houten

           106

                         

                          minister
           let us pray
          everyone clasps their hands closes their eyes hazel keeps
          staring at van houten too shocked to do a thing

                          van houten
           we need to fake pray now
          van houten bows his head hazel still stunned slowly turns
          back to the minister trying to make sense of this unexpected
          appearance

                          minister
           now i call on augustuss close
           friend isaac to say a few words
          isaac stands walks up to the podium with someones help
          hazel sneaks one more look at van houten yup its really
          him that makes no sense to her isaac starts to speak

                          isaac
           of all the things ive lost in my
           life this hurts the most
          and isaac stops talking its unclear if that was the end or
          if he just cant go on he returns to his seat the minister
          walks back up

                          minister
           and now well hear from guss
           special friend hazel lancaster
          hazel stands walks up to the podium a few titters in the
          room at the words special friend

                          hazel
           i was his girlfriend
          some laughter from the crowd she takes out her notes

                          hazel
           theres a beautiful quote in guss
           home that reads if you want the
           rainbow you gotta deal with the
           rain
          hazel continues to speak but we over it we hear instead

           hazel vo
           i didnt believe a word of course
           but that was ok funerals id
           decided arent for the dead
           theyre for the living
          guss parents arm in arm nod along with every word cut to

           107

                         

          ext cemetary  day
          everyone is watching guss body be lowered into the ground
          everyone but hazel she looks off into the distance
          off to the side we see van houten also not watching the
          burial hes watching hazel cut to
          later ceremony over we see hazel with her parents

                          hazel

                          hazel

           a while
          hazel hugs mom and dad walks alone towards the parking lot
          as she gets to the car van houten approaches

                          van houten
           could i hitch a ride
          hazel doesnt want to help this man

                          van houten
           just to the bottom of the hill
          hazel exhales fine once theyre both in the car

                          hazel
           how did you even 

                          van houten

          hazel is inside the car rummaging crazily through the trash
          in an effort to find what van houten gave her shes about to
          give up when she sees it  crumpled up into a ball beneath
          the passengers seat she reaches under pulls it up and
          unwraps it as she reads we hear

                          guss voice

           trying i just i could use a
           little flair see the thing is
           we all want to be remembered
          she smiles to herself remembering
           that first time gus and hazel ran into each other
           the staring contest in support group

                          guss voice
           we all want to leave a mark
           driving badly in guss car
           their first kiss at the picnic by funky bones

                          guss voice
           but not hazel hazel is different
           hazel knows the truth she didnt
           want a million admirers she just
           wanted one and she got it maybe
           she wasnt loved widely but she was
           loved deeply and isnt that more
           than most of us get
           and back to hazel reading the letter tears in her eyes

                          guss voice
           when hazel was sick i knew i was
           dying but i didnt want to say so

          she sleeps he kneels by her side

                          guss voice
           she was in icu and i snuck in for
           ten minutes and sat with her before
           i got caught her eyes were closed
           her lungs were intubated

          gus takes her hand and holds it

                          guss voice
            but her hands were still her
           hands still warm and the nails
           painted this dark blue back color
           and i just held her hands and i
           willed myself to imagine a world
           without us and what a worthless
           world that would be
           and back to hazel reading the letter she never knew that

          tank dragging behind her she lays down on the grass and
          looks up at the stars  the same image that opened the movie

                          guss voice
           shes so beautiful you dont get
           tired of looking at her you never
           worry if shes smarter than you
           cause you know she is shes funny
           without ever being mean

                         she remembers
           the magical dinner at oranjee
           the bench in which they sat overlooking the water
           the passionate kiss in anne franks house
           falling onto the bed together

          [all of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
          movie only now we see the oxygen tank we see guss leg we
          see the fumbling and the difficulties etc they dont make
          these images less beautiful they make them twice as
          beautiful  because theyre real]

                          guss voice
