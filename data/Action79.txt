          land on a runway of my designation
          where it will not be molested that
          will conclude my interest in that
          plane and your responsibility for

          these are the old plans when the
          longer runways went in thats
          twelve years ago and it looks like
          they did some modifications on site
          moved tracon phone ils  all the
          underground stuff so they could
          handle drainage if im right all
          of it would run along the edge of

          past this neighborhood

                         they struggle
          too  bad  mcclane 
          the sound of metal sliding  a knife appears in grants hand

          too late he realizes hes over the front edge of the wing! he
          screams and falls 

                         417 new angle 417
          right into the engine intake! theres an awful grinding sound a
          scream  mcclane winces as red snow splatters him 

          418 rear of engine 418
           it could be hamburger pouring out  but before we can dwell on
           it the engine pod blows!

          18a mcclane  on the wing 418a
           wipes red snow from his arm

          419 in the cockpit 419
          a fire indicator goes on esperanza hits extinguisher
          handles it  increases power to the other engines

                         420 stuart 420
           tryingto see  finally  a glimpse of what has to be mcclane
           with a savage grin stuart takes off his rifle  discards the
           bulky coat  knife in hand he steps out

                         421 mcclane 421
           moves hand over hand to a trailing section of the wing looks
           over and down at

          422 fuel port  upside down  his pov 422

                         

                         

                         

                         

          423 back to scene 423
          he reaches for it too far stretches gets it  fucker is
          tight wincing he turns it a bit  then looks up just in time
          to see stuart knife whizzing down 

                         424 new angle 424
          mcclane rolls but the knife catches his shoulder in pain he
          manances to kick stuarts knee  stuart falls almost goes over
          the wing  mcclane goes back to work on the fuel port itturns
          another 1/4 turn and then he has to abandon it to deal with
          another charge from stuart

                         425 esperanza 425
          he turns the plane now hes on the runway proper

          426 mcclane and stuart 426
          fighting for the knife withall his strength mcclane jams
          stuarts knife hand the aerilon crack! the next wiggle of the
          metal crunches both hand and knife! stuart screams and loosens
          his grip on mcclane who punches him away goes back to work
          on the fuel port!
          but hes hardly at it when stuart recovers and mangled hand
          held clawlike kicks mcclanes injured shoulder kicks again
          blood on stuarts shoe  mcclane is being worked over the edge
          of the wing! he catches at the last moment  now he ignores
          stuarts blows because 

          427 under the wing 427
          mcclane feels for the fuel port  turn turn  it opens! fuel
          spigots down  mcclane feels the wetness on his hand 

                         428 the runway 428
          a ribbon of fuel twists behind the moving plane slick and light

                         reflecting 

          429 back to scene 429
          stuart stomps on mcclanes hands on the wing  crunch stomps
          again  mcclane smiles and then stuart kicks him off the wing!

                         430 mcclane 430
          drops 20 feet slams into the snow at the edge of the runway
          bounces like litter thrown from a moving car  the big rear tire
          almost rolls over him 

                         431 stuart 431
          with a victorious shout he yanks the coat from the aerilon
          throws it away  heads for the door

          crawls to a painful sitting position face impassive he watches
          the jet move away and  incongrous as it seems  he lights a

                         435 mcclane 435
           battered like a car wreck victim now he looks up into the dark
           sky trying to find the sound of jet engines then he sees 

          436 lights of hollys plane  his pov 436
           careening down in a desperate fight against gravity

          about to close it he looks back and for the first time sees

          439 the jet fuel  his pov 439
          winding endlessly down the runway

           sees the flame racing towards him  turns to shout to esperanza

          but as the craft rises so does the flame climbing the fuel
          ribbon right into the sky and to the nearest engine which

          explodes!

          442c esperanza 442c
          turns at the explosion in time for a wall of fire that shoots up
          the wing and through the cockpit floor and then hes on fire

                         and then

                         443 stuart 443
           is blown to little pieces as a fireball blows right out the door
           taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then

          444 the plane  long shot 444
           it explodes itself wings and tail and body going nine different

          dives for the ground as the explosion rolls towards him

          447 in the cab 4471
          they watch the fireball in the distance 

                         448 mcclane 448
          gets to his knees and looks at the huge conflagration

                         mcclane
          towards the sky
          honey theres your landing lights

          449 int hollys plane  cockpit 449

          blackness and driven snow outside  and then  in an almost
          cinematic fade  through the glass we see the burning wreckage
          and more importantly  the line of fire running clean and
          straight for almost a mile 
          a line right along the runway

                         copilot
          look  !
          the pilot grabs controls desperately trims the plane

          451 ext her plane 451

          it descends a bit erratic but now its alongside the line of
          fire coming in from the wrong end of the runway and then the
          wheels bounce once twice and then a tire blows but the pilots x
          hold it as it swerves and finally skids to a halt turning onto x
          the grassy field
          already we hear rescue sirens

          452 in the cab 452

                         barnes
          listening to headset
          one forty is down! they used the

          and sure enough there it is  the sound of engines 

          453 ext sky  landing pattern 453

          and now the lights come down from the sky in a neat and patient
          row the closestfilling the screen the others dwindling down to
          the size of stars

          454 mcclane  on the runway 454
          stumbles along maybe thinking hes dead or dreaming ignoring
          the giant plane landing beside him ignoring the flames beyond
          that  his concentration is totally on hollys plane now
          another giant plane skids down behind him  its an assembly
          line like b29s coming home from war  then he sees what hes
          praying for  breaks into a run

          as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers
          pour down the steps into arms of friends families loved ones

          461a mcclane 461a
          sets holly down kisses her  then both turn at a honk
