          rack focus beyond her arm to the erect nipples that are
          piercing through her sheer top like small tents
          back on rick as his eyes go wide with terror and he looks
          away

          illuminated digital type reads 69!!! he quickly punches the

          steering wheel tight at tenandtwo

          well it would be inappropriate
          ricks voice has taken on a firmer more adult tone paige
          seems amused by it

                         paige

                         smiles

          rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep
          so he just pulls the covers over her shoulders
          as rick walks around the bed and into the bathroom in the
          bg we hold on maggie until she opens her eyes she
          listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge
          of guilt and when he shuts off the faucet she closes her
          eyes again and we

                         cut to

          approaches carrying a tennis racket we see several tennis
          courts in the bg

                         fred

          better if they did cheat and get it
          over with

          the girls look to dr lucy

          dr lucy contd
          im just saying maybe a little
          freedom would be good for them and
          for you

                         beat
          have you ever considered giving
          them a hall pass

                         grace
          a what

          dr lucy
          a hall pass a week off from
          marriage
          grace and maggie stop chewing

          im saying give them a week off
          from marriage

                         beat
          look most married men have foggy
          memories of their single days and
          they somehow get under the
          impression that if not for you
          theyd be able to be with ail those
          women who entice them

                         grace
          thats fred he thinks because he
          sees big tits everywhere and then
          still comes home for dinner that i
          should be welcoming him at the door
          like some conquering hero
          dr lucy smiles

          dr lucy
          well maybe its time to let them
          go out there and find out what its
          really like

                         maggie
          wow youre talking about the
          nuclear option
          maggie ponders the idea

                         grace
          and remind me again what good
          could possibly come from this

          dr lucy
          theres a wonderful principle in
          psychology called reactance
          theory it basically states that
          if youre constantly told you cant
          do something you want to do it
          more than ever and conversely if
          you remove the taboo you remove
          the obsession
          grace makes a t sound

                         grace

                         sarcastic
          i got an idea doc why dont you
          try a hall pass out on your husband
          and let us know how it works out

          dr lucy
          oh i have
          grace and maggie react to this

                         maggie
          youre telling us you let charlie
          sleep with another woman
          dr lucy takes a moment before answering

          dr lucy
          i am not telling you that i am
          telling you that i gave him the
          freedom to choose for himself

                         grace
          and

          dr lucy
          all i know isour marriage is
          better than ever
          grace and maggie think about this

                         grace
          i dont know theres a reason that
          men evolved and apes didnt its
          because women demanded more
          without a wife einstein wouldve

          int another part of the upstairs  moments later

          rick walks down a hall and finds fred in a guest room
          watching a baseball game on tv

          maggie grace and the others follow ed into a safe room

          i think having a safe room is a bit
          over the top but ed feels with our
          two little ones you can never be
          too cautious

          rick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while maggie
          stands across from him rubbing her temples it looks like
          the norman rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her
          little boy for sneaking a frog into the house

                         maggie
          you know what really troubles me
          the thing that youre all so
          obsessed with is meaningless to
          you its really just about numbers
          with you guys
          rick looks up confused

                         maggie contd

          well virginity is different for
          guys

                         maggie
          occasionally
          rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come
          clean

          looking through the passenger window at fred hes sitting
          in the drivers seat his eyes are closed and his head is
          slung back as he jerksoff just below frame to the music
          a police cruiser passes in the bg then a moment later
          backs into frame and stops next to fred
          as the two police officers look on from their car trying to
          figure out what the guy is doing the oblivious fred
          continues to stroke his meat to the beat

          officer #1 gets out of the drivers side he disappears from
          frame and then reappears at freds drivers side window now
          only inches from fred he bends over and looks inside the

          car
          the officer motions for his partner to join him as fred
          continues to pound himself to the music officer #2 climbs
          out of the cruiser he takes out his flashlight and shines
          it on freds os lap as the weary officers look at each
          other with a nowweveseenitall expression we

          gathered on their front lawns to see whats going on
          pan to freds front steps where we see a handcuffed fred
          standing meekly as the two police officers confer with a
          furiouslooking grace in her bathrobe

          of course im concerned but what
          choice did we have

                         grace
          we couldve kept the status quo i
          mean were things really that bad
          that we had to try something this
          extreme

                         maggie
          for me they were

                         beat
          look you may call this a hall
          pass but for me its more of a
          hail mary pass im serious i
          dont know what else to do

          that night when we got home rick
          and i were gonna you know and i
          was waiting for him in bed while he
          tucked the kids in and i started
          wondering who he would be thinking
          about during sex would it be the
          girl he checked out on the way into
          the party or would it be missy
          frankenfieldbecause i noticed him
          gawking at her or how about one of
          the waitresses or maybe somebody
          he saw at work that day then when
          he came into the room i did
          something id never done before i
          pretended to be asleep

                         grace
          youre kidding me youve never
          done that i do that all the time!
          maggie almost smiles

                         maggie
          look i understand that people have
          fantasies and that youre not
          always thinking about the person
          youre with

                         grace
          thats for sure

                         maggie
          but its justi dont know its
          been too long since i felt that he
          was thinking about me

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45

                         maggie contd
          i need this hall pass to work
          grace because if it doesnt i
          dont know whats going to happen

          rick is taken aback by this

                         rick

                         waning confidence
          well of course i mean if wed

          days in and the only woman ive
          spoken to was our waitress at
          outback and she never even made
          eyecontact

                         rick
          i dont really care if some
          waitress makes eyecontact i want
          to go homei miss my wife and
          kids

                         fred
          let me explain something to you if
          grace and maggie find out we cant
          get laid on our own theyll start
          thinking we need them to get laid
          do you know what thatll do to the
          balance of power in our homes
          itll destroy it!
          rick thinks about this and grows alarmed

                         rick
          well what if we just tell them
          that we did hook up

                         fred
          we cant gracell know she always
          knows when im lying

                         rick
          hey what about a massage parlor

                         fred
          no! thats giving up
          fred glares at him

                         fred contd
          you dont get it do you a hall
          pass aint all about sex its
          about being man enough to pick up a
          woman even though you may not be
          whatin the traditional senseis
          considered
          makes quotes with

                         fingers
          goodlooking or
          finger quotes again
          appealing
          rick seems stung by this news

                         fred contd
          look if we cant show that
          something positive can come from
          having a hall pass then the whole
          concept is dead not just for
          usbut for all mankind
          rick thinks about this for a moment then stands up with a

          renewed sense of purpose

                         rick
          all right lets get out of here i
          know exactly where we should be

          thrilled to be in such capable hands grace is getting
          tossed around a bit but its clear that maggie can hold her
          own on a dance floor

          well as it turned out nothing

                         blushing
          i guess the original plan was to go
          to new york and try to hookup with
          one of the big dance companies but
          then i got married and  your
          priorities change

          maggie appreciates the sentiment she makes strong eye
          contact with rick for a moment but catches herself and looks
          away

                         maggie

          sink while he washes his hands a young naked metrosexual
          type whips his leg into the sink beside him rick slowly
          turns to look
          ricks pov  as the metrosexual talks to another naked man
          he fills his hand with shaving cream and the hand disappears
          between his own legs the guys continue their conversation
          unfazed then the metrosexual starts to shave his balls
          as rick dries his hands he cant contain himself

          rick enters the empty hot tub room takes off his towel and
          eases into the steaming water he hits a button and the jets
          kick on full blast turning the hot tub into a bubbly

          cauldron

          settles in and closes his eyes

                         dissolve to

          same scene  later
          rick is in a deep sleep his mouth is wide open but his head
          is barely above water as he snores loudly he dips beneath
          the surface and as he begins to choke and cough he wakes up
          rick takes a moment to get his bearings then struggles to
          get out of the hot tub but his muscles have turned to jelly

                         rick

                         weakly
          little help
          when none comes a lifeanddeath struggle ensues as the
          flabby middleaged dad tries to climb to safety

                         rick contd
          help me
          just as rick starts to go under the two young naked
          metrosexuals hear his moans and come to his rescue they
          jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore as rick gasps for
          air one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts ricks
          head onto his naked lap

                         paige
          so rick hows the hall pass
          going
          paige smirks at rick who shrinks a little

                         paige contd

          in fact i thought it was very
          classy of you to be staying at the
          holiday inn express instead of
          bringing girls back to your home
          with all the kids pictures and
          schoolwork taped up everywhere
          rick forces a smile

          never happen again
          gerry looks confused

                         gerry

          husband

                         gerry
          so what does that have to do with

          than just what it was
          she looks at him and shrugs apologetically gerry barks out
          a laugh

                         gerry

          your guys hall pass they
          convinced their wives to give them

          heard about it at the pool

                         rick
          no! at the pool!
          rick rubs his face distressed

                         boshane
          yep and then about three days ago
          after some hardcore negotiating
          we managed to push the bill
          through
          the guys laugh rick can hardly believe what hes spawned

                         rick

          just then gary comes around a corner

          to freedom!
          the guys tap their beer cups then exit toward the back deck
          a dejected and defeated rick watches them go then turns and
          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door as he
          opens the door to leave he finds himself facetoface with

          leigh

                         leigh

          thought we were gonna play some
          games
          she smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away we go

          int coakleys house  second floor  night

          rick and leigh walk down the hall to the game room he opens
          the door and flips on the light
          their pov  theres a pool table a few pinball machines a
          bar and a bed

                         leigh

          use the bathroom
          rick nods then watches as leigh walks off and disappears
          into the bathroom he takes a deep breath this is it
          just then he hears os laughter rick heads down the
          hallway and pushes open a door

          coakley os
          hey
          reverse angle reveals coakley sitting all alone in a small
          study off the hall he has a bowl of capn crunch on his lap
          and is watching a rerun of the andy griffith show

                         coakley
          all partied out pal
          rick nods understanding coakley laughs once again at the

          tv

                         coakley contd
          man that barney fife still kills
          me
          he looks back to rick

                         coakley contd
          hey i was thinking about this hall
          pass business its really ironic
          isnt it
          rick glances down the hall to see if leigh has returned

                         rick
          hows that

                         coakley
          well think about it theres two
          kinds of guys who cheat on their
          wives the guy who does it behind
          her back and a guy like you who
          has his wifes permission

                         rick
          well its not really cheating if i
          have permission

                         coakley
          yeah whatever the point is if
          you asked a hundred people who the
          better cjuy is ninetynine of em
          would pick you because youre
          being honesttheres no deceit
          involved
          rick is growing uncomfortable

                         coakley contd
          but the funny thing is the other
          guy the cheater the bad guy he
          has to live with all that guilt and
          anxiety while his wifes running
          around happy as a clam because she
          doesnt know anything and you the
          good guy youve got no guilt at
          all because you just laid it all on
          your wifes shoulders

                         rick
          well i didnt really think of it

                         like

          coakley chuckles and rick deflates

                         coakley contd

                         rick

          and that my friend is why you are
          a genius
          as rick lets this all sink in we

                         cut to

          int rick & freds hotel room  night

          kind of guy to say no to a
          beautiful young girl like that

          as aunt meg climbs on top of fred we

                          cut to

          int coakleys house  game room  night

          rick enters to find leigh playing a pinball machine leigh
          turns and smiles at rick

                         rick

                         leigh

          doing this i have you know
          commitments
          leigh nods at this then unties a shoulder strap and her
          dress falls to the floor suddenly shes naked before him
          and shes perfect

                         rick contd

                         weakly
          um you dropped something
          for a moment nobody moves we can almost hear ricks heart
          beat then leigh steps closer to him and rick instinctively
          leans back

                         leigh
          relax dont think so much youre
          gonna have your wife for the rest
          of your life but tonight  you
          have me
          leigh smiles and its the kind of smile you only get two or
          three times in your life if youre lucky and probably never
          from a woman this beautiful
          she reaches down and unbuckles his pants then she pulls off
          his shirt they stand facetoface now the middleaged guy
          and the young beauty and its happening exactly the way rick
          had hoped it would the dream
          she presses her body against his and starts to kiss his neck
          her hand disappearing somewhere below his waist then she
          leans her head against his chest as he looks down at her
          we push in on a suddenly conflicted rick

                         rick
          nope i cant do this
          he reaches for his shirt

                         leigh
          what are you doing

                         rick
          im sorry
          she stares at him confused as he buckles his pants

                         leigh
          your wife didnt give you a hallway
          permission slip did she

                         rick
          yes she did but look youre
          insanely beautiful and
          pathologically sexy and every cell
          in my body is telling me to dust do
          this but
          rick points to his chest

                         rick contd
          see this area this spot right
          here the first time maggie and i
          slept together back in college
          she fell asleep right here and she
          left a puddle of drool and it
          didnt bother me it actually felt
          good thats when i knew i was
          going to marry her

                         beat
          and when my kidsemma and gunnar
          when they were babies this is
          where they slept or sometimes at
          four oclock in the morning emma
          would just lay there and stare up
          at me it was where we first got to
          know each other

                         beat
          so im sorry leigh but as amazing
          as i think you arei gotta go
          home
          rick shrugs apologetically

                         leigh
          well i think you have a screw
          loose and youre probably going to
          regret this for the rest of your
          life but  right on man

                         rick
          umdo you want me to give you a

          back down to the party
          rick raises two fingers

                         rick
          peace it

                         leigh
          rock in the usa
          as they smile at each other one last time we

                         cut to

          int freds minivan  night

          rick is pulling away from coakleys house when the car phone
          rings rick pushes a button to answer

          thought hed go through with it
          he brushes her hair from her face and they look into each
          others eyes he leans in and she does too and right when
