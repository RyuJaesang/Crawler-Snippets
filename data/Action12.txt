               carnbys taxi accelerates down the street pulling away from
               pinkertons taxi
          
               as soon as its evident that they are on to him pinkertons
               taxi speeds up to give chase
          
               the two taxis rocket down the streets swerving past cars
               screeching around corners
          
               carnbys taxi speeds down the streets narrowly avoiding
               collisions with other cars and pedestrians
          
               pinkerton just plows through whatevers in his way smashing
               past other cars forcing pedestrians to jump out of the way
          
               pinkerton accelerates and tries to force carnbys taxi off
               the road the taxis grind against one another
          
               carnbys taxi screeches around a corner speeding into a side
               street that leads to the market street

                a busy street crowded with pedestrians open shops and
                produce stalls
          
                carnbys taxi races down the busy market street followed by
                pinkerton
          
                they swerve and screech down the street cutting off other
                cars and narrowly avoiding pedestrians
          
                but then pinkertons taxi zooms up beside carnbys taxi and
                bumps into it with a grinding crush of metal
          
                not stopping pinkertons taxi continues to grind into
                carnbys taxi the momentum pushes carnbys taxi around
                sideways
          
                pinkertons taxi then slams carnbys sideways taxi into a
                parked car with a crush of metal and shattering glass
          
                theres a moment as carnby trapped inside the crushed taxi
                and pinkerton flooring the accelerator to add more pressure
                exchange a look pinkertons expression is fierce
          
                pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse backing up in order to
                smash into carnbys taxi again
          
                the cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi his
                face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts the cabbie
                struggles to get loose
          
                                      cabbie
                            im trapped man!

                            ill draw him away
          
                as pinkertons taxi backs up it crashes into a van driving
                by knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents
                of the van onto the street
          
                this gives carnby the brief moment he needs to extract
                himself from the crushed taxi he wrenches himself out the
                window just in time to see pinkertons taxi accelerating
                towards him
          
                carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped
                cabbie
          
                pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi aiming it right for
                the running carnby pinkertons taxi rockets towards him
          
          
                                                                  continued

                the side of a building narrowly missing him pinkertons
                taxi is crumpled in a crash of metal and glass
          
                carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the
                building with fluid grace carnby rolls to safety landing
                on his feet with a quick look back over his shoulder at
                pinkerton in his crumpled taxi carnby runs
          
                pinkerton steps out of his taxi seemingly unhurt by the
                crash he looks around but cant see carnby anywhere on the
                street
          
                pinkerton runs for an ironwrought staircase that leads up to
                a pedestrian bridge that hangs over the street
          
                at the top of the pedestrian bridge pinkerton looks up and
                down the street
          
                he spots carnby running through the crowd of pedestrians
          
                pinkerton leaps off the pedestrian bridge arcing through the
                air with superhuman force
          
                pinkerton tackles the running carnby to the ground slamming
                into him with a tremendous impact
          
                but carnby is quick he takes the hit and spins pinkerton
                around with a martialarts kick the kick sends pinkerton
                crashing through the front window of a bakery

                pinkerton comes crashing through the display window landing
                in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass
          
                but seemingly unfazed he just picks himself up and walks

                carnby stands in a crowd of bystanders watching in surprise
                as pinkerton exits the bakery his expression fierce
          
                pinkerton immediately spots carnby and comes after him

                and smashes it against the floor once then twice
          
                pinkerton tears open carnbys trenchcoat he pulls out the
                burlap sack he opens the sack confirming the stone carving
                is inside it
          
                while pinkerton inspects the stone carving carnbys hand
                quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them
          
                carnby smashes the glass jar over pinkertons face

                out into a small cluttered alley
          
                carnby lands hard in the debris but he rolls with the fall
                and is back up on his feet running
          
                the alley ends in a high wall with a billboard on top of it
                the wall has a railing along one side
          
                carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running

                loading dock of the ice factory

                barely bumping into him
          
                but as carnby passes him he deftly grabs the beat cops gun
                from his holster
          
                the beat cop doesnt even notice his gun is missing as he
                turns annoyed to see carnby racing away

                runs directly at the high wall
          
                pinkerton leaps up scrambling right up the side of the wall
                he hauls himself up the billboard until hes standing at the
                top of the billboard itself
          
                pinkerton looks down below and spots carnby running into the

                the crates on it the worker pushing the dolly falls back
                shocked pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing
                after carnby
          
                the beat cop fumbles for his gun its not there pinkerton
                smashes the beat cop out of the way as he pursues carnby
          
                the beat cop flies into a pile of crates knocked out

                the refrigerated ice factory is filled with neat rows of ice
                blocks factory workers mill about transporting the blocks
                of ice through the factory
          
                carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks he checks the
                beat cops gun to make sure its loaded it is
          
                carnby stops sensing something
          
                in one fluid motion carnby suddenly spins turning in the
                other direction and firing the gun
          
                we follow the bullet as it rockets through the ice factory
                it whizzes along until we see carnbys intended target
          
                pinkerton comes through the ice factory running at carnby
                the bullet flies directly at him
          
                the bullet hits pinkerton in the shoulder but it only seems
                to anger pinkerton further he keeps running at carnby

               pinkerton leaps at carnby carnby fires again but pinkerton
               dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice shattering it
               in a hail of ice shards
          
               pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks
               of ice blocks
          
               carnby tries to track pinkertons movements through the ice
               stacks he hears the sound of pinkerton moving but cant see
               him his gun is ready he searches around
          
               suddenly theres a rush of movement behind him carnby
               dodges just as pinkertons fist comes flying out pinkerton
               connects with an ice block shattering it
          
               carnby is backed into a dead end in the ice factory he turns
               to face pinkerton gun ready
          
               but pinkerton is on him too quickly he lunges at carnby
               hoisting him over his head and slamming him down on a
               conveyer belt
          
               pinkerton drags carnby along the conveyer belt but carnby
               grabs a hanging chain to steady himself with a quick kick
               carnby uses the momentum to flip pinkerton over him
          
               pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick
               wedged into the wall the sharp point of the ice pick punches
               right through pinkertons torso impaling him he is
               immediately killed
          
               carnby leans up against the wall steadying himself he pulls
               the stone carving out of his pocket to check it in the
               fight the carving has been cracked into pieces
          
               but the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it a
               small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving
          
               the artifact is a gold circle flat on the top and bottom

               hudgens still holding the boxcutter strains against the
               door using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut the
               metal rod wedged against the door is starting to buckle

               is even more intense but the door holds
          
               finally the thrashing stops all is quiet again

               back on hudgens listens straining to hear anything at all

                off only low glows flickering sporadically
          
                the display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows
          
                the guard walks through the room shining his flashlight
                around he cant see anything out of the ordinary
          
                a whoosh of movement slips past the guard he turns quickly
                nothing
          
                he shines his flashlight around looking for anything out of
                the ordinary he stands with his back to a display case
          
                from out of the shadows behind the display case a long
                segmented tail emerges
          
                 the tail is covered in hard dark scales at the end of the
                tail is a sharp spike
          
                the tail suddenly flicks at the guard piercing him through
                the back of the head and out his mouth the tails spike
                glistens with fresh blood
          
                the guards flashlight clatters to the floor the bulb
                breaks

               aline and carnby quietly come out a service door that leads
               to the ceramics room they conceal themselves behind a pair
               of columns scanning the area before they step out
          
               the lights are dim with long shadows stretching out through
               the area
          
               aline is about to speak but carnby puts a finger to his
               mouth and shakes his head no
          
               the dead body of the guard lies in a pool of blood on the
               ground there seems to be no one else around
          
               but then silently moving with a fluid grace a xenomorph
               creature emerges out of the shadows
          
               the xenomorph creature is huge terrifying it is seven feet
               tall covered in thick dark scales it stands on two legs
               with long powerful arms that end in razorsharp claws and a
               segmented spiked tail poised behind it
          
               its demonic head has black sunken eyes and a severe jaw
               lined with jagged fanglike teeth the head is identical to
               the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased
          
               carnby and aline look shocked they freeze not moving a
               muscle
          
               another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows
          
               the two creatures congregate in the middle of the room they
               are the same hulking grotesque brutes
          
               the two creatures start to communicate an unintelligible
               language passes between them
          
               suddenly one of the creatures looks up sensing something
          
                the creature looks directly at carnby and aline hiding
               behind the columns
          
               the creature delivers a sharp whisper
          
               and with that the creature fades into invisibility it has
               totally disappeared
          
               the second creature immediately follows suit also fading
               invisible

                an invisible creature comes racing after them all that is
                visible is the effect of the creatures movement it knocks
                over a statue as it chases after them the statue smashes to
                the ground

                but his bullets dont hit anything except the wall on the
                other side of the hallway

          the claws cut deep gashes into her she screams in pain

               female and marko male burst through the skylight
               rappelling down on ziplines from the hovering helicopter
          
                they each carry a sleek hightech assault rifle with a lamp
               mounted on the top they all wear full bureau 713 combat

               dark visor mounted on it
          
               the creatures hiss in reaction and scramble out of the
               spotlights from the helicopter
          
               the agents immediately open fire their bullets glow with a
               pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air
          
               all carnby and aline can see is the agents shooting glowing
               bullets into the unnaturally long shadows
          
               but the squeal of one of the creatures shows that the agents
               bullets have found their target
          
               as the glowing bullets hit the creature it momentarily
               flashes visible then invisible again
          
               the two invisible creatures scatter slipping away into the
               shadows
          
               the agents cut their ziplines dropping to the ground
          
               as they land they all flip on their riflemounted lamps the
               bright blue beams cut through the darkness
          
               their movements are precise controlled they all have their
               rifles out scanning the area

                immediately at her side firing at the invisible creature
                their bullets glow as they streak through the air

               fischer pulls the spinalworm out of pinkertons open back
               with a pair of tongs it hangs limply motionless
          
               the spinalworm is long and thick covered with hard dark
               scales it has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were connected
               to pinkertons spine
          
                ischer drops the spinalworm in a tub
          
                ischer notices the handheld scanning device is beeping

               on himself running it up and down his torso nothing
          
               fischer looks at carnby carnby gets it it might be him

                    priority ever since but its been almost
                    exclusively in rural areas this kind of
                    urban infiltration is unprecedented

                    have you isolated any weaknesses
          
          fischer brings up an image of the periodic table
          
                              fischer
                    most metals pass right through them so
                    normal bullets and blades are useless
                    but theyre vulnerable to elements 76 to

                    if they disrupt electricity why did my

                              fischer
                    the closer the current to its power
                    source the less disruption
          
          fischer takes a handheld parameter scanning device off a
          rack it is a sleek updated version of carnbys parameter
          similar to the agents riflemounted scanners

                    this is calibrated to track their
                    disruption field it wont help you see
                    them but youll know when theyre
                    nearby
          
          fischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures
          disruption field displaying how it works

                    they live almost exclusively in darkness
                    sunlights lethal in large doses but
                    only certain light frequencies hurt them
          
          fischer takes a rifle off the rack and lays it down on the
          counter in front of them

                lamp into place at the top of the rifle

                fischer takes out several magazines of ammo out of the
                cabinet he discharges a bullet it glows yellow in his hand

                          but for maximum damage we use bullets

                warily carnby holds out the handheld scanner checking to
                see if it registers anything but the loft reads clean

                hudgens walks through a dank cement room various pieces of
                scientific equipment sit in a corner shelves are lined with
                ancient artifacts small sculptures and masks
          
                hudgens stops at a work station and pauses a look of pain
                crosses his face he winces holding it in he steadies
                himself
          
                at the other side of the lab is a large recess in the space
                the opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold
                the cage appears to be empty
          
                but suddenly an invisible creature slams into the bars of
                the cage trying to lunge at hudgens
          
                as it hits the bars fingers of electricity jolt through it
                making it visible for a split second
          
                hudgens watches calmly he goes to a small dial built into
                the wall beside the cage hudgens turns up the dial
          
                in the cage jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the
                invisible creature it squeals and hisses from the
                electricity

                creature is unconscious but still alive
          
                hudgens turns the dial back down
          
                hudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to
                the cage
          
                he injects the syringe into the creatures neck between two
                of its scales he withdraws a syringefull of the creatures
                black sticky blood
          
                he goes back to the work station rolling up the sleeve of
                his shirt his arm is pocked with injection marks
          
                hudgens ties off his arm preps a vein and injects himself
                with the syringe of creatures blood he closes his eyes
                feeling the substance flow into him

               shocked

          fischer is suddenly grabbed and slammed into the wall the
          impact knocks several framed photos of fischer and his wife
          off the wall they shatter as they hit the floor
          
          fischer is punched in the face hard he is stunned
          
          fischer is hurled over the couch he lands heavily on a glass
          coffee table shattering the glass tabletop
          
          the impact knocks his revolver out of his hands
          
          fischer lies dazed in the broken glass he looks up at his
          attacker
          
          its hudgens standing over him
          
          hudgens slams his fist into fischers face fischer is now
          only semiconscious
          
          hudgens pulls out a long thin spinalworm its many clawed
          feet and razorsharp jaws snap away its segmented scaled
          body writhing in his grip
          
                              hudgens
                    if you cant beat us fischer join us
          
          hudgens grabs fischer by his hair and pulls his head back
          forcing his mouth open
          
                                                                 cut to
          
          we follow the spinalworm as it enters fischers mouth
          slipping down his throat
          
          we continue to follow the spinalworm as it makes its way
          through fischers body weaving through the twists and turns
          of his digestive system and internal organs
          
          the spinalworm tears through layers of fischers insides
          finally making its way to his spine the spinalworm then
          wraps itself around fischers spine its tiny clawed feet
          grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length
          
          we move up fischers spinal cord to his brain the spinal
          worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts
          we travel through fischers brain and out of his eyes
          
                                                                 cut to
          
          fischers expression is now calm hudgens regards fischer
          looking pleased with himself

                something catches his eye carnby fiddles with the artifact
          
                suddenly the artifact telescopes out instead of one thick
                ring it is now three successively smaller rings one piled
                on the other with a common hollow middle

                in the medium and small rings into place
          
                the four pieces fit together perfectly creating a

                          something smells amazing

                carnby sits down across from aline they eat while they talk
          
                                    aline
                          i figured out a connection with the
                          symbols on those artifacts they
                          correspond to constellations but

                          maybe this will help
          
                carnby takes out the assembled abkani device and puts it down
                on the table between them
          
                aline picks up the device fascinated she runs her fingers
                over the abkani symbols carved into the lynchpin artifact
          
                she goes to her bag and pulls out the map she was working on
                and the cd she hands carnby the cd
          
                                    aline
                          can you run the program on this
          
                carnby goes over to his computer and inserts the cd

                connecting up constellations with locations on the map she
                writes out latitude and longitude calculations
          
                aline comes up to carnby at the computer the program is
                waiting for her calculations
          
                she leans past carnby and enters the latitude and longitude
                numbers into the program the computer processes the
                information hundreds of map images flash across the screen
                as the computer searches for a match

                          the abkani used constellations to pin
                          point a geographical location but i
                          dont think i can isolate it closer than
                          a hundred mile radius
          
                the computer finds a match a specific map appears onscreen
                with a 100 mile radius circle marked in the center of it

          chamber in his revolver the bullets glow
          
          carnby looks up sensing something he spins around ready
          
          a figure stands behind him it is john
          
          john looks fierce his face drawn gaunt his eyes are sunken
          into dark recesses with nearly clear irises

          john lunges at carnby carnby is too surprised to defend
          himself john slams carnby against the wall knocking his
          revolver out of his hands
          
          john picks carnby up and hurls him across the loft carnby
          crashes through furniture as he lands heavily
          
          out of the shadows behind aline two figures emerge they are
          both missing orphans one male one female they have the
          same gaunt faces and clear irises as john
          
          carnby picks himself up he spots the orphans behind aline
          
                              carnby contd

          the two orphans lunge at aline but shes able to dodge out
          of the way the orphans are fast and fierce aline leaps
          forward sliding across the floor towards carnbys revolver
          
          she grabs it and spins to face the two orphans theyre gone
          
          
          
          
                                                                 continued

          hitting the female orphan in the shoulder
          
          the female orphans jumps away into the shadows aline
          scrambles to her feet the revolver ready but the female
          orphans has disappeared
          
          aline runs over to carnby he grabs a shotgun from the
          weapons cabinet and loads it
          
                              aline

          carnby pumps the shotgun carnby and aline creep forward into
          the darkness of the loft they listen
          
          suddenly john lunges at him his teeth bared
          
          carnby smashes john across the head with the shotgun but
          john keeps coming slamming him against the wall carnby
          breaks johns hold and swivelkicks him out of the way john
          skitters off into the shadows
          
          the female orphan leaps out at aline trying to tear into her
          with her teeth
          
          carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for
          aline
          
          the male orphan lunges out at carnby he smashes the male
          orphan across the face with the pipe

          chest with a shotgun blast john flails back dead
          
          the male orphan jumps out at carnby now working on instinct
          carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut impaling him
          the male orphan stumbles to the ground and dies
          
          aline gets away from the female orphan as the female orphan
          lunges at her again aline fires shooting her three times in
          the chest

          female orphan falls back dead

          carnby throws aline the pistol she catches it in midair
          she checks it like a pro
          
          aline and carnby stand together guns drawn ready
          
          theres a moment of quiet they listen
          
          the lights in the loft flicker the scanner beeps
          
          something smashes into the lofts front door
          
          carnby grabs the parameter it beeps more insistently
          
          the front door bursts open knocked right off its hinges by
          the invisible creature crashing through it
          
          pov creature
          
          the invisible xenomorph creatures skewed inhuman pov as
          it looks across the loft searching it locates carnby and
          aline and heads directly for them
          a
           ll that is visible of the creatures trajectory is furniture
          being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them
          
          the creature smashes right through a glasstopped work table
          shattering it papers whirl around in its wake

          carnby and aline leap out of the way at the last moment
          rolling away in opposite directions they simultaneously open
          fire their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on
          
          the creature squeals flashing visible from the multiple
          impacts their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it
          tumbles to the ground dead
          
          the creatures invisible corpse lies motionless broken

          the computer monitors also go dark
          
          the scanner starts beeping frenetically electromagnetic

               but the first thing they hear isnt a creature its the
               sound of automatic gunfire
          
               streaks of glowing bullets fly through the air
          
               it is a 713 unit laying down suppressing fire as the agents
               enter the loft through the broken front door

               the muzzle flashes and glowing bullets pierce the darkness of
               the loft
          
                hadows swim through the space as the invisible creatures
               move around them attacking the agents with their razorsharp

               an invisible creature swoops out of the shadows towards an
               agent who is firing in the opposite direction the creature
               whips past the agent slicing him open with a fluid slash of
               its claws the creature keeps moving directly for carnby
          
               carnby and aline standing together fire their weapons in
               the darkness oblivious to the creature rushing towards them

          but at the last second carnby turns instinctively as the
          creature lunges at him
          
                               carnby

          carnby and aline turn and open fire on the creature it
          flashes visible from multiple hits flailing off into the
          darkness
          
          agent barr fires controlled bursts of glowing bullets into
          the dark loft he screams into his commlink

          the sound of a helicopter can be heard outside the loft
          
          pov creature
          
          another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall
          avoiding the gunfire it locates its target an agent firing
          up at the ceiling it races towards the agent
          
          the agent turns to the attack and tries to fire but the
          creature is too fast it slams the agent back against the
          wall and impales him with its spikedtail
          
          agents barr and cheung spot this and open fire on the
          creature it flails about fading visible from the impacts
          
          the creature tries to scurry away but barr and cheung are on
          it with precision and speed they blow the creature away
          
          but more creatures attack the fighting is fierce glowing
          bullets streak through the darkness the agents are calm and
          determined as they engage the creatures
          
          carnby and aline hold their own sticking together shooting
          at whatever shadows move around them
          
          six agents in full combat gear burst into the loft leading
          the unit is commander burke agent miles is with him as is

          incendiary flashgrenade at the upper level of the loft
          with a flash of blinding light the grenade explodes
          creatures squeal as flames swoop up through the upper level
          
          glowing bullets fill the dark loft creatures squeal and
          flail from the hits
          
          in the darkness of the loft carnby aline and the agents
          finish off the remaining invisible creatures
          
          the last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets the
          agents strafe the creatures corpse to make sure its dead
          
          agent barr and carnby exchange a look between them barr
          clearly respects carnbys abilities

          totally trashed a small fire burns in the upper level
          
                               burke

          miles runs a handheld scanning device over johns corpse
          the scanner beeps indicating the presence of a spinalworm
          
                              agent miles
                    sir this ones infected too!
          
          agent turner scans the female orphans corpse his scanning
          device beeps she has a spinalworm too
          
                              agent turner
                    got another one here!
          
          burke immediately turns his weapon to carnby the red laser
          sight makes a glowing dot on carnbys chest
          
          taking their cue from burke the other agents in his unit all
          train their weapons on carnby several glowing red dots
          hover on his chest

                    organism he could be under its control
          
          aline turns to carnby

          carnby holds his weapon at his side he doesnt drop it but
          he doesnt move either

                    forget to pay your power bill carnby
          
          an agent standing at the other end of the loft hears
          something shuffling behind him he turns to look
          
          something grabs the agent slams him back against the wall
          and rips out his neck
          
          its another orphan with the same fierce gaunt look and
          clear irises
          
          burke turns away from carnby for a moment trying to figure
          out whats happening
          
          carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at burke
          burke sees this but before he can react carnby fires
          
          carnbys bullet whizzes past burke and hits an orphan dead
          center in the gut sending him flailing back dead the
          orphan was about to pounce on burke
          
          theres a moment as burke and carnby look at one another
          burke realizes carnby just saved his life
          
          the orphans attack
          
          they are the grownup children from carnbys orphanage like
          pinkerton they are difficult to kill immune to pain fast
          and deadly they all have the same gaunt wild look with
          sunken eyes and nearly clear irises
          
          the orphans leap out at the agents quick and fierce they
          bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw
          around the agents and tear them apart
          
          the dark loft is again lit up with glowing bullets streaking
          through the darkness the agents riflemounted lamps shine
          around but the effect is chaotic disorienting
          
          
          
          
                                                             continued

          continued 5
          
          
          as the orphans attack they make quick work of many of the
          agents glowing bullets fly around everywhere the screams of
          agents being torn apart mix with bursts of automatic gunfire
          
          carnby and aline stay together dodging the attacking
          orphans and firing into the darkness
          
          an orphan rises up behind carnby he spins and shoots her in
          the side but she just keep coming carnby shoots the orphan
          again this time dead center in the chest the orphan
          collapses dead
          
          carnby checks the corpse the bullet came out the other side
          a mixture of red blood and black sticky ooze drips from a
          bullet hole right over the orphans spine
          
          carnby grabs the commlink off the body of a dead agent
          
                              carnby into commlink
                    all agents! youve got to kill the
                    organism to stop them! aim for the spine!
          
           cross the loft burke listens to the commlink
          
          an orphan is attacking agent miles burke takes careful aim
          and shoots the orphan in the back right on the spine the
          orphan falls over dead
          
                              burke into commlink
                    confirmed spinal shots a kill shot
          
          with this information the agents quickly gain the upperhand
          against the orphans attack the orphans are fast and deadly
          but they have no organization now that the agents have a
          handle on this new threat their precision and speed returns
          
          soon the battle is over dozens of bodies of dead agents and
          dead orphans lie littered around carnbys destroyed loft
          
          only carnby aline burke miles barr cheung marko and
          turner remain alive
          
          burkes and carnbys eyes meet burke approaches carnby
          
          the other agents all stand by waiting for an order from
          burke aline watches them ready to step in

          agent miles pulls off his commlink
          
                              agent feenstra
                    i cant walk if i lay down suppressing

                              agent miles
                    i die fighting or i dont die at all
          
          agent miles opens fire into the night his bullets glow as
          they streak through the air feenstra picks herself up and
          opens fire alongside him
          
          creatures squeal in the distance as the bullets find their
          marks feenstra empties out her last magazine
          
          an invisible creature leaps over the barricade and pounces on
          feenstra tearing into her
          
          miles shoots at the creature emptying his last magazine but
          hes too late to save feenstra her tornup body slumps
          against their barricade
          
          agent miles is alone he is out of ammunition he pulls the
          trigger futilely miles stands firm he flips up his visor
          
          miles closes his eyes he is hoisted into the air by an
          invisible creature and thrown to the ground invisible
          creatures tear him apart

                carnby aline barr and burke take cover behind the stone
                column burke holds a remote detonator it is active
          
                burke tries to get a signal on his commlink but all he gets
                is static looking grim burke prepares to press the button
                on the detonator
          
                                       aline
                             you sure this is going to work
          
                burke shrugs and presses the button the detonator counts
                down 3 2 1
          
                a tremendous explosion rocks the sand chamber sand whirls
                through the air concrete fragments blow out from the recess
          
                as the smoke clears carnby aline burke and barr approach
                the recess the concrete wall has been blown open smoke
                rises up off the ruined wall
          
                the sand chamber now opens up into another dark room

                carnby aline barr and burke step over the rubble of the
                concrete wall they shine their lights around the dark room
          
                they are in a large abandoned bureau 713 lab thick dust
                covers all surfaces but it was once a hightech facility
          
                on one side of the lab is a sliding metal door
          
                                       aline
                             what is this place
          
                medical equipment scientific instruments and computers have
                been left as they were untouched for two decades
          
                a series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall in each
                tube a spinalworm lies dead floating in gelatinous liquid
          
                aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to another
                wall they are anatomical schematics for the spinalworms
                there are also diagrams of the human body with markings
                isolating key areas of the spinal cord
          
                carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass basins
                each about the size of a child
          
          
                                                                       continued

          continued
          
          each basin has a small metal tag on it carnby wipes the
          layer of dust off one of the metal tags
          
          the tag reads e carnby

                    this is where it happened

                    who did this to you
          
          burke and barr continue to explore the room with their rifle     
                                                                            
          mounted lamps barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors
          
                              agent barr
                    commander
          
          carnby burke and aline approach barr at the hangar doors
          
          next to the hangar doors is a control panel barr pulls the
          front off the control panel revealing a rusted handcrank
          
          barr pulls on the handcrank it wont give carnby joins him
          and together they strain to move the handcrank the hand
          crank clanks into the open position
          
          an old mechanism is engaged the hangar doors slide open
          revealing another doorway behind them but this one is
          clearly not part of the lab
          
          it is an ancient solid gold door carved with abkani
          symbols the gold door is built into a wall of rough rock it
          looks like the lab was built right around the gold door
          
          in the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening
          a
           line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door
          one symbol is prominent among the others the dark spirit

          continued 2
          
          
          aline reaches into her pack and takes out the abkani device
          it is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door
          the same dark spirit pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin
          
                              carnby
                    so its a key
          
                                                                             
          burke surveys the room with a grim expression
          
                              burke

                              aline
                    the pictograms carved here make it pretty
                    clear thats a bad idea
          
                              burke
                    two we set enough c4 to bury this

                    here for good
          
          carnby stares at the gold door
          
                              carnby
                    the answers ive been looking for my

                              aline
                    some doors are locked for a reason
          
          carnby looks away from the gold door                              
          
                              carnby
                    barr how much c4 you got left
          
          barr pulls open his pack revealing several packages of c4
          
                              agent barr
                    enough to blow this place to
          
          barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head
          
          blood spurts out as barr collapses to the ground dead
          
          hudgens stands behind them carrying two pistols

          before they can react hudgens presses a pistol to alines
          throat he points the other pistol at burke and carnby

                    our early work was crude i admit but                     
                    eventually we perfected the implant                        
                    process you were our last failure

                    you couldnt have opened it anyway not
                    without this
          
          hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on
          the erebus he hands it to aline
          
          aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at
          the bottom of the device turning it into place the device
          is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom

               hudgens steps through the doorway
          
               the doorway opens up into a vast cave hundreds of feet high
               and wide stretching off into darkness the cave walls are
               roughhewn rock untouched by human hands
          
               the walls of the cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds
               of tunnels pocking the rock like a hive leading off into
               the depths of the mountain
          
               hudgens moves into the cave tentative but excited
          
               suddenly theres a scratching scurrying sound
          
               a xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels
          
               out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph and a third
          
               across the vast cave dozens of xenomorphs creep out of
               individual tunnels
          
               hudgens steps further into the cave the xenomorphs approach
               him their heads darting about
          
               the xenomorphs surround hudgens on all sides his steps are
               careful he reaches his hand out to one of the creatures
               t
                he creature moves up to hudgens hand smelling it
          
               the creature lunges at him ripping into him with its teeth
          
               the other xenomorphs surrounding hudgens pounce on him as
               well the creatures tear hudgens apart
          
               like a dam breaking hundreds of xenomorphs start streaming
               out of the hivelike tunnel system of the cave

                the hangar doors in front of the abkani doorway start to
                close aline backs away from the doorway
          
                aline opens fire with an assault rifle the glowing bullets
                streak into the dark cave hitting several of the approaching
                creatures but there are too many of them they keep coming
          
                the hangar doors are almost closed the xenomorphs are only a
                few feet from the doorway
          
                the hangar doors slam closed just in time
          
                a heavy impact thumps against the other side of the hangar
                doors then another the xenomorphs are trying to get though

                carnby approaches the sliding metal door at the side of the
                lab the dust around the door has been swept back

                             where hudgens got in
          
                carnby engages the opening mechanism and the door slides
                open revealing a dark tunnel leading away from it

                he has to do is press the button on the detonator

                sound of impacts against the doors echo down the tunnel

          we look down at carnby and aline alone in the intersection
          empty streets all around them we start to float up above
          them getting a wider and wider birds eye view of the city
          
          we swoop up higher above them but still no one is visible
          anywhere in the city we float up until the entire city
          stretches out below us nothing moves no one can be seen
          
                              carnby vo contd
                    heres what i know there are two worlds
                    on this planet a world of light and a
                    world of darkness for millions of years
                    these worlds were in balance but now
                    the lights of human civilization burn
                    everywhere the dark places are
                    disappearing we forced them to come out
                    of the shadows now its my job to force
                    them back in my name is edward carnby

          we start to drop back down faster and faster the ground
          rushing towards us we are descending directly above carnby
          and aline standing alone in the empty intersection
          
          we swoop down right in front of carnby his trenchcoat blows
          in the wind aline stands next to him ready
