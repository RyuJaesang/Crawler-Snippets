          scarlet stops shoveling wipes dirt from her face
          
                              scarlet
                    im gonna use it as a showpiece for
                    clients thanks for asking
          
                              mike
                    kind of a big undertaking isnt it
          
                              scarlet
                    i am a landscape designer then
                    again you barely took an interest
                    in my work so i guess thats a fair
                    question
          
          an awkward silence   then
          
                              mike
                    i didnt get it
          
                              scarlet
                    im sorry but maybe this is what
                    you needed maybe its time you
                    looked for something else
          
                              mike
                    thats a great idea scar because
                    there are so many options out there
                    for a 36 year old with only a high
                    school diploma

                              scarlet
                    and its all my fault isnt it

                    it would be way too easy to say
                    stan preys on the weak because hes
                    simply a dick no stans more
                    complex than that according to
                    leading psychiatrists stan is a
                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons 1 under
                    all that male bravado theres an
                    insecure little girl banging on the
                    closet door trying to get out 2
                    like a caveman stans brain is
                    underdeveloped therefore stan is
                    unable to use selfcontrol so he
                    acts out aggressively and the
                    third reason
