          sticks into the target  the maid spins around flustered
          wayne at the other end of the long room lowers a composite
          bow picks up his cane

           reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother it cant be the same
           one  her pearls are in this safe 
          he reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau revealing a safe door
            which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable

                         
          which swings open with an awkward creak

                          maid

           of course sometimes exceptions
           have to be made

                         
          the maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window
           goodnight mr wayne
          she flips backwards through the window wayne smiles then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace

          alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
          lower becoming a ramp at the bottom alfred is level with
          a series of dark slate obelisks  a bridge over the water to
          where wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube

           orphanage see my mom died when i
           was small car accident i dont
           really remember it but a couple of
           years later my dad was shot over a
           gambling debt i remember that just
           fine looks at wayne not a lot
           of people who know what it feels
           like do they to be angry in your
           bones people understand foster
           parents understand for a while
           then they expect the angry kid to
           do what he knows he can never do
           to move on to forget

                         
          wayne stares at blake

                          blake
           so they stopped understanding and
           sent the angry kid to a boys home
            st swithins used to be funded
           by the wayne foundation see i
           figured it out too late you have
           to hide the anger practice smiling
           in the mirror like putting on a
           mask you showed up one day in a
           cool car pretty girl on your arm

           the reactor is beneath the river so
           that it could be instantly flooded
           in an event of a security breach

                         

                          miranda

                          wayne
           if it worked it doesnt
          wayne leads miranda to the core two perpendicular rings of
          electromagnets suspend a bowlingballsized mass of metal
          wayne hits buttons  the ball glows then dies to cold

                          wayne

                          miranda
           youve built a lot of security
           around a damp squib
          nothing
           about three years ago a russian
           scientist published a paper on
           weaponized fusion reactions one
           week later your reactor started
           developing problems looks at
           wayne i think this machine works

                         

                          wayne
           miranda if it were operational
           the danger to gotham would be too
           great

                         

                          miranda
           would it make you feel better to
           know that the russian scientist
           died in a plane crash six months
           ago

                         

                          wayne

           pavel did someone else will figure
           out how to turn this power source
           into a nuclear weapon i need you
           to take control of wayne
