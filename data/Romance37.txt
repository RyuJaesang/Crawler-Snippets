           i think there will be a groundswell
           movement towards simplicity
           people will start to listen to

           audi because the economy is tanking

           job soon you bought a samsung cell
           phone because you think it makes
           you seem more businessoriented
           unlike the iphone which is for
           teenage girls you go to yoga
           because you went to a sub ivy
