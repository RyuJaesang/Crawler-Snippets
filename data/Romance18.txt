               with due respect i should

          and port!!
                    lady mansfield
          which has gone to my head already!

elizabeth is knelt at the ponds edge with james  a paper
boat floats on the water toppling over to a unanimous cry

oliver watches as dido approaches his eyes light up
                    elizabeth
          oh dido look  mr james has made
          me a boat and it has capsized
james stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat

                    dido
          what a dreadful shame

oliver collects paper from the grass close on his hands as
he folds it into a boat under didos nose
                    oliver
              to dido earnest
          for you

          thank you
he places it in the water stands and examines dido from
afar lady mansfield watches
                    oliver
          miss lindsay would you do me the
          honour of taking some air with
          me some time
dido is dumbstruck  what to say james is halted
                    james
          dont you care what people will say

     dido is jolted by the antangonism in james tone 
     elizabeth too  it pierces her and she speaks up
                         elizabeth
               what is that to mean mr james
               what should anyone say!
     james hesitates then

                         james
               that he should compromise a
               ladys reputation by stepping out
               with her  scarcely having made
               her acquaintance!
                         oliver
               i think you are a great deal too
               anxious brother we should merely
               take a turn around vauxhall
     dido observes james  his protestation is bitter she
     traces olivers features warmly
                         dido
               i should be delighted mr oliver!

he chuckles brings his hand up to brush her cheek gently
she smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentlemans
head shoulders  his movement somehow familiar
the sight roots her uncertain of what she sees and then
he turns to address another and his profile becomes clear

it is john davinier
in that moment he flicks his head round and his gaze falls
on her  a beat between them then his eyes fall on oliver
john excuses himself from others and makes his way across

          i am under a third cousin  a
          solicitor here nothing more
          than petty disputes between
          unsavoury landlords and debauched
          tenants but i cannot discount it
                    dido
          not what you wished for
                    john

              agitated
          tis pitiful! such inability to

          anothers life
                    dido
              bitterly
          what price a worthless negro

                    john
              frustrated
          you utterly misunderstand me
          i am saying that no man may have
          the value of that of cargo!!!
          human beings cannot be priced
          since we are priceless!! freemen
          and slaves alike!
her eyes begin to sting at the integrity in his words

              enthused
          i am with others here we are
          all students in law  applying
          pressure on the insurance companies
          to refuse from here on to insure
          slaves on any ship a simple clause
                    dido
          but that would require a change
          of law i know nothing but

                    john
          a change in law  something the
          insurance companies can lobby for
          if they can be persuaded to band
          together
              softly
          we may only be students
          butchange is most always
          precipitated by the young
              shrugs  poignant
          someone has to have the courage
          how can we expect to be civilised
          if we live in a barbaric world
his words wind her as john shakes his head frustrated she
takes him in  he is so very handsome!

          industrial slaughter of so many
dido stares at him earnestly
                    dido
          no it is more than that its
          the shame of a law that would
          uphold a financial transaction
          upon that atrocity
she is scathing and accepting all at once affecting him
                    john
          that is indeed the truth

their eyes are locked an intimate beat that perturbs her

          good bye miss lindsay
              he pauses
          i suspect we will never see each
          other again

                whether the jettison clause of
                marine insurance law may be brought
                to bear in this appeal this is
                the question that is first
                whether the slaves were drowned
                as an anticipatory act an act to
                avoid the disease caused by their

                    lord mansfield contd
          or secondly whether they were
          jettisoned as cargo! to save
          captain and crew from certain death
          when the extended journey threatened
          shortage of drinkingwater
              steely eyed
          let me be clear loss of water on a
          ship constitutes a singularly
          dangerous affair  insurrection of
          thirsty and hostile slaves at its
          extreme  and an impossible task to
          share diminished water reserve among
          all those living at best each
          implies severe threat to the lives of
          the seamen in such circumstances our
          law is transparent and equivocal 
          the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
          is legal!
              he spells it out
          and in these circumstances combined
          with unavoidable loss of water our
          laws leave the shipowners securely
          within their rights to make a claim
          and behoves the insurers to pay
          losses
                    dido
          no!

gasps from around the roomgasps that turn into cries
including didos own john is rigid anger rising

                    lord mansfield
          the ships owners chose a tight
          packing fashion to transport
          the slavesa popular fashion of
          transportation that is known for
          causing death and disease

his voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court
                    lord mansfield contd
          this choice of laying the slaves
          tightly together is undertaken at
          the captains own risk in the
          event that over packing renders
          an avoidable lack of drinking water
          on board a protracted journey
          such a decision may be viewed as
          simple bad management on a
                    more
                                                             98

          captains part and further weigh
          as his own risk an extended journey
           one in which the destination is
          overshot may also be viewed as
          the captains own mismanagement
the noise lowers to silence lord mansfield settles on john

                    lord mansfield contd
          it is not legalto discharge lives
          from a ship into the waters to
          prevent those lives dying on land
          and to facilitate insurance
          compensation whether they be the
          lives of horses or human beings
          slaves or otherwise  it is
          not legal neither is it right

dido lets out a gasp  breathless relief
                    lord mansfield contd
          further the claim of shortage of
          water is illegitimate shown by the
          evidence put forward to my
          mind it is clear a fraud has been
          committed in claiming insurance on
          slaves who weredrowned solely
          for financial gain
he looks around the room  sees lord ashfords acceptance
his eyes fall on dido now and here they remain
                    lord mansfield contd
          it is my opinion that the state of
          slavery is so odious a position that
          nothing may support it this case
          has displayed with searing clarity
          the depravity of any such nation
          whose choice is to practice it you
          may be certain that i have laboured
          over my judgement and statements
          today and am in full understanding
          of all of the ramifications justice
          be donethough the heavens may fall
johns eyes brim at the realisation of those words

                    lord mansfield contd
          i find in favour of the insurers
          and overturn the decision of the
          lower court i order a retrial

stunned confusion in the courtroom then all kinds of
commotion  anger cheers amid shock lord mansfield stands

          no! that your feelings for me are
          so that you would be my wife

through his own sobs then tears turn to laughter
