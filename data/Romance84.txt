           carpet by the security

           sidney vo
           the lookyloos dream is that one
           day they will somehow get to
           mingle with the stars but the
           industry cant allow any
           mingling stars have to be kept
           away from civilians have to be
           quarantined so they dont become
           normal like us
           they pass a ravishing hollywood actress walking the other
           way she looks curiously at the pig as she passes sidney
           stares after her longingly

           shadow boxing he opens the blinds and turns to the couch
           the woman wakes up from where she has been sleeping on
           the couch and gazes blearily at sidney

          35 int heywood building  entrance security  morning 35

           as the song continues sidney still swaggering is escorted
           through the formidable looking security by a thin and chic
           assistant the entrance hall arches above them a vast and
           impressive cavern of chrome and glass

           sidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift
           examining the chic assistant and two stunningly beautiful
           models who are in conversation sidney manages to catch the
           attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes
           is a rakish smile in return he receives an icy glare

           sidney vo
           these are my models

           the chic assistant leads sidney down a curving red
           carpeted corridor past a chrome wall inscribed with the
           giant logo of the magazine they reach a set of double
           doors which the assistant opens for sidney

           what the fuck are you wearing
          the song grinds to an abrupt halt sidney loses a quantity
          of swagger he examines his tshirt

                          sidney

                          clayton harding

                          gravely
           that is some consolation
          sidney notices that the copy of the postmodern review is

                          sidney

                          clayton harding

                          interrupting

           room its not nothing dont get
           me wrong but there are plenty of
           people in this town who never
           made it past the first room
           after a year or so maybe longer
           youll discover a secret doorway
           at the back of the first room
           that leads to the second
           eventually if youre lucky
           youll discover another doorway
           back of the second room that
           leads to the third
          he gazes at sidney through narrowed eyes

           clayton harding contd
           there are seven rooms in all
           youre in the first im in the
           seventh and doncha forget it
          sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration

                          sidney

                          beat

           room  will i become a true jedi
           knight
          harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette

                          clayton harding
           which brings us to the subject of
           your sense of humour i had a
           look through your magazine
           here

                          sidney
           whatd you think
          clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out
          over the manhattan skyline

           the lift stops and a tall woman enters she is expensively
           dressed wears chanel dark glasses an expression of
           granite and an air of superhuman froideur
           alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares
           tensely ahead only sidney busy chewing is oblivious to
           the plunge in temperature
           for a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift then
           sidney begins to choke on some burger he wheezes for a
           moment gagging
           the woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of
           having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her
           alison closes her eyes
           sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger
           and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back
           of the oblivious womans prada jacket
           sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the
           offending item away
           before he can move alison silently takes his wrist in a
           vicelike grip

           she cant work her way through the crowd she turns to her
           right but finds her way similarly blocked
           she hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs
           down into the pool the water up to her chest and begins
           to walk through the floating flowers towards them
           sidney stares at her transfixed alison notices this with
           some contempt
           gradually everyone notices sophie and stops to look
           having reached the other side sophie ascends the pool
           steps laughing her dress clinging to her venus rising
           from the waves the photographers appear snapping merrily

           motion
           sidney springs forward leaping onto the desk and then in
           one bound onto a filing cabinet by the window sending it
           rocking slightly forward
           cuba bounding forward jumps into the air
           sidney just manages to slam the window shut as

           back in normal time
           cuba bounces off the glass with a yelp and drops to the
           floor
           sidney heaves a sigh of relief
           then a metal sculpture on the tilted filing cabinet slides
           forward and drops with a terminal thud on the dog below
           silence

          89 ext pool  evening 89

           sidney lies beside the pool staring darkly into the water
           and nursing the beginnings of a hangover we hear faint
           music and laughter from where the party continues in the
           house behind
           he notices the reflection of the starry sky in the water
           and reaching out gloomily to hold one of the stars the
           reflection dissolves into ripples when the water settles
           sophie maes reflection stares back at him

           entrance to a park a sign advertises an outdoor screening
           of la dolce vita

           near the back

          she is holding her notebook watching the movie beside her
          is the remains of a picnic with lit candles
          sidney smiles and starts towards her then stops she is
          sitting next to a man as sidney watches she rests her head
          on his shoulder
          sidney watches numb then turns to walk away
          bob stands in front of him in full drag waving
          frantically he starts to run towards sidney who sighs and
          closes his eyes  as if things werent bad enough
          then bob runs straight past him sidney turns to see the
          man next to alison standing up to embrace bob the two
          kiss

          on the grass
          alison watches bob and her friend embrace with a touch of
          sadness suddenly she realises someone is standing beside
          her she looks up and sees sidney
          she stares at him long beat
          sidney holds out his hand
          alison hesitates and then takes his hand and stands up

                          sidney
           hows the novel

                          alison
           finished
          sidney smiles he takes the notebook from her and tosses it
          back onto the picnic blanket then he kisses her as he
          does so he takes the ring and slips it into alisons coat
          pocket
          then they begin to dance chachachaaing happily at the
          back of the park as the music swells lit by the
          flickering light from the screen
          suddenly sidney freezes staring over alisons shoulder to
          where we can see he has accidentally thrown her notebook
          onto a lit candle
          it is now on fire
          sidney shoves alison aside and dives for the book

           cut to black
