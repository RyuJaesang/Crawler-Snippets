     fade in

     ext cityscape  night

     the place is gotham city the time 1987  once removed

     the city of tomorrow stark angles creeping shadows 
     dense crowded airless a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete selfgenerating almost subterranean in its 
     aspect as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing a dangling fat moon shines overhead ready 
     to burst

     ext cathedral  night

     amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate gothic 
     anomaly old city cathedral once grand now abandoned  
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition

     on the rooftop far above us stone gargoyles gaze down from 
     their shadowy windswept perches keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below sightless guardians of the 
     gotham night

     one of them is moving

     ext gotham square  night

     the pulsing heart of downtown gotham a neon nightmare of 
     bigcity corruption almost surreal in its oppressiveness 
     hookers wave to drug dealers street hustlers slap high
     fives with threecard monte dealers they all seem to know
     each other with one conspicuous exception

     a tourist family mom dad and little jimmy staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag theyve just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out and 
     now  playbills in hand  they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of gothams meanest street

                              mom
               for gods sake harold can we
               please just get a taxi

                              dad
               im trying to get a 
                     shouting
               taxi!!

     three cabs streak pass and disappear mom grimaces in 
     frustration as little jimmy consults a subway map

                              jimmy
               were going the wrong way

     nearby street types are beginning to snicker dad surveys 
     them nervously gestures toward the subway map

                              dad
               put that away well look like
               tourists

     two cops lean on their patrol car outside an allnight 
     souvlaki stand sipping coffee and chatting with a hooker 
     the hooker smiles at jimmy  jimmy smiles back mom yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at dad

                              dad cont
               well never get a cab here lets
               cut over to seventh

                              jimmy
               seventh is that way

                              dad
               i know where we are!

     ext side street  that moment  night

     a deserted access street sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     strippeddown cars mom dad and jimmy take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street a voice startles them

                              voice
               hey mister gimme a dollar

     the voice belongs to a derelict  nineteen or twenty 
     acnescarred  who sits between two garbage cans his palm 
     uplifted his ratty tshirt reads i love gotham city

     mom dad and jimmy pause for the merest of seconds then 
     move on  pretending not to hear

                              derelict
               mister how about it one dollar
                     standing up
               one dollar man are you deaf
               are you deaf  do you speak
               english

     by now the tourists are halfway across the street 
     mercifully the derelict doesnt seem to be following

     they pick up their pace they dont see the shadowy figure 
     in the alleyway they dont see the gun until a gloved hand 
     brings it down buttfirst across the back of dads neck

     dad crumples mom grabs jimmy and backs up against a brick 
     wall too terrified to scream the derelict races across 
     the street to join his confederate the street punk whos 
     already searching for dads wallet

     moms mouth opens in panic they can see shes about to 
     snap  so  the street punk still in a crouch trains his 
     gun on jimmy

                              street punk
               do the kid a favor lady dont
               scream

     the poor woman is utterly horrified tears stream down her 
     face but she keeps her wits about her stifles the urge to 
     shriek and hustles jimmy off down the street

     the two punks watch them break into a run  then chuckle 
     slap hands race off in the opposite direction

     ext rooftop  night

     six stories up the punks  nick and eddie  hunker down 
     on the tarandgravel roof sizing up their take

                              nick
                     emptying the wallet
               all right the gold card
                     tossing the credit card
                     in eddies face
               dont leave home without it

     a chill wind whips across the roof as nick extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it theres a distant indistinct 
     clang metal on metal eddie hears it and tenses up

                              eddie
               lets beat it man i dont like
               being up here

                              nick
               what scared of heights

                              eddie
               i dunno man after what happened to
               johnny gobs 

                              nick

               walked off a roof all right no big
               loss

                              eddie
               that aint what i heard that aint
               what i heard at all
                     beat
               i heard the bat got him

                              nick
               gimme a break will you shut up 

                              eddie
               five stories straight down there
               was no blood in the body

                              nick
               no shit it was all over the
               pavement

     nick has no patience with campfire tales  but here on the 
     roof in the pale moonlight he cant ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine 

                              eddie
               there was no blood man
                     beat
               my brother says all the bad things
               you done they come back and
               haunt you 

                              nick
               listen to this how old are you
               there aint no bat

                              eddie
               my brothers a priest man

                              nick
               no wonder youre such a chickenshit
               now shut up
                     conclusively
               there aint no bat

     as they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof some fifteen yards away 
     where at the end of a line a strange black silhouette is 
     dropping slowly implacably into frame 

                              eddie
               you shouldnta turned the gun on
               that kid man you shouldnta 

                              nick
               do you want this money or dont
               you now shut up! shut up 

     both punks freeze at the sudden inexplicable sound of 
     boots crunching on gravel they turn slowly their jaws 
     drop

     standing at the edge of the roof bathed in moonlight is a 
     black apparition it does not move

     eddie stands rooted to the spot a choked gurgle in his 
     throat as if hes just seen his own death the black 
     figure advances spreading  its arms or rather its wings 
     great black batwings flapping in the wind

     nick drops to the gravel gropes for the gun brings it up

     and still the black figure draws closer deliberate 
     menacing on its chest the emblem of a bat in an oval 
     yellow field glowing like a target in the darkness 

     nick fires twice two clean hits the strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof

     trembling sweating buckets nick gets to his feet he 
     whacks a motionless eddie on the arm 

                              nick cont
               im gettin outta here

      and bends to retrieve his loot eddie lets out a 
     strange preverbal squeal 

      and nick sees the human bat back on its feet 
     nightmarish undead moving slowly and inevitably closer

     panic sheer raw unrelenting panic stolen money flutters 
     out of nicks hands he scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down the black spectre is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape trapped like a rat nick fires wildly

     eddie is frozen in place his eyes glazed over his face 
     drained of blood the bat treads calmly past a leg snakes 
     out a black boot catches eddie high on the chest 

      lifts him cleanly off his feet 

      and sends him flying through the air eddie slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious a broken 
     weightless puppet

     this action is so smooth so automatic that the bat does 
     not even break his stride nick sees his chance and charges 
     past the black wraith scrambling toward the fire escape 

     a gloved hand slices through the air and nick pitches 
     forward his legs ensnared in a tangle of wires screaming 
     now he drags himself across the gravel roof the looming 
     figure of the bat at his heels 

      until theres no place left to go nick cowers against 
     the ledge his pants torn his hands and knees bloody he 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria

     almost by reflex nick keeps shooting hed do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes by now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber but nick continues obsessively to 
     pull the trigger he weeps he moans he wails 

     the bat grabs a fistful of nicks shirt and with 
     supernatural ease hoists him into the air

                              nick cont
               dont kill me dont kill me 

     when nick finally opens his eyes he realizes the bat is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof  holding him out at 
     arms length over six stories of nothingness

     the gruesome black apparition speaks in a rasping whisper

                              batman
               i wont kill you i want you to do
               me a favor

     nick looks down far far below cars wink silently past

     he looks up and sees in the mirrored lenses where 
     batmans eyes should be the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face

                              batman cont
               tell your friends tell all your
               friends

     nick howls almost as an afterthought the batman heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof and then  casually 
     without a moments hesitation  steps off the ledge of the 
     roof into midair

     trembling nick crawls to the ledge and looks over 
     finding absolutely no trace of the batman

     nick is still screaming as we pan up to the bilious yellow 
     globe of gothams moon main credits roll

                              batman

     int gotham city democrats club  night

     an oversized campaign poster fills one wall a new gotham 
     harvey dent for district attorney we tilt down to find 
     the man himself determined dynamic harvey dent 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium

                              dent
                it is no longer enough to go
               after the smalltime punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               gotham city crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     another angle  the audience

     civicminded politicos decked out in fundraiser finery 
     they applaud dents tough talk wildly theyve just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner and by god theyre 
     going to enjoy this

     tuxedoed waiters move among the tables deftly refilling 
     water glasses as they do we see an empty place setting  
     the only one in the hall some wellmeaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up

     the engraved placecard reads bruce wayne

     angle on dent

                              dent
               if elected my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against boss carl

     int apartment  night

     a womans apartment decorated in pastel pinks and mauves 
     original paintings and sculptures everywhere the place 
     reeks of money

     in the foreground a mans hand long elegant manicured
     manipulating a deck of cards doing a onehanded shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse

     in the background a tv set tuned to the 11 oclock news 
     with highlights of harvey dents campaign speech

                              dent
                     on the tv screen
               together we can make gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play

     the hand sets the deck on an end table raps it twice 
     turns up four aces off the top this most unusual deck 
     sports a 22 calibre bullet hole straight through the 
     middle

                              jack napier
               decent people shouldnt live here
               theyd be much happier someplace
               else

     jack napier 32 is righthand man and chief enforcer to 
     boss carl grissom his features are delicate almost 
     feminine and he takes a vain gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance he is also absolutely merciless

     he trains a cold eye on dents televised image as alicia 
     hunt  26 beautiful carl grissoms kept woman  glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up

                              alicia
               anything new

                              jack
               the usual gas if this clown could
               lay a hand on grissom i wouldve
               had to kill him by now

     alicia finds jacks necktie draped over a nearby chair she 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck

                              alicia
               if grissom knew about us he
               might kill you

     jack seems uninterested in her affections his eye darts 
     back and forth between the tv and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity

                              jack
               dont think so angel im too
               valuable thats the way ive
               planned it
                     pause
               and besides he doesnt know

     jack checks his watch reaches for his topcoat and stands 
     in front of the vanity he runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair checks out his albert nipon ensemble

                              alicia
               you look just fine jack

     he smiles at himself before turning to the door

                              jack
                i didnt ask

     knox spots eckhardt and the medic waves cheerily and 
     saunters down the alley eckhardt curses under his breath

                              eckhardt

               a bat i tell you a giant bat!
               he wanted me to do him a favor!

     knox tilts one eyebrow eckhardt and the medic trade 
     disgusted looks

               no offense boys but these guys are
               seeing something up there

               sixfoot bat in gotham city

     knoxs tone is jokey but only halfjokey eckhardt snorts 
     in disgust and turns away knox shouts after him

     hes headed for his car when he spies a stretch limo idling

     eckhardts lap he looks down and laughs daring eckhardt 
     to pick it up  just as the two enormous goons from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement

     eckhardt wipes blood from his mouth as jack  an aone 
     crazyboy grin on his face  reaches down for the gun

     knox and vicki are taking an unauthorized tour of bruces 
     house wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world

                              knox

     of bruce wayne 32 tall athletic impeccably mannered 
     and intensely handsome

                              knox

               ive just insulted the host
                     extending a hand

               me to miss vale

     knox blinks at vicki bruce already seems to know who she 
     is knox shrugs and forges bravely ahead

                              knox
               this is miss vale  that felt
               redundant

                              bruce
                     to vicki
               youre just back from corto maltese

               thats intriguing they havent been
               published yet

     bruce smiles and ignores the implied question

                              bruce
                you have an extraordinary eye

     hes laying on the charm now knox his territorial 
     instincts aroused pipes up

                              knox
               some people think she has two

     vicki shoots knox a sidelong glance

                              vicki
               dont mind my friend hes a little
               nervous tonight

     knox chastened calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition bruce is charming all right but theres 
     something formal maybe even calculating about it  he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards its 
     almost as though hes an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm

     this is a man who thinks three moves ahead knox doesnt
     like him but vicki  whos used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off at will  doesnt seem to mind at all

                              vicki cont
               this is an amazing house id love
               to shoot it sometime

               into each other

     suddenly alfred the butler appears in the doorway behind 
     them he clears his throat bruce turns

                              alfred
               excuse me sir commissioner gordon
               was compelled to leave  very
               unexpectedly he asked me to convey
               his regrets

                              bruce

               great pleasure meeting you
                     to knox
               and you

     without bothering to shake hands bruce does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room

                              knox
               i know the rich are different but
               that guy is real different

     vicki staring off after bruce doesnt seem to hear him

                              knox cont
               hello vicki

                              vicki

               looks hes got a mirror in every
               room

     and indeed the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     wall mirror eight feet wide running from floor to 
     ceiling

                              vicki
               i get it bruce vain

     she pokes knox he groans at the dumb pun and suddenly we

                                                 cut to

     reverse angle  through the mirror

     looking down on knox and vicki  through oneway glass  
     as they continue to chat behind the mirror recording 
     everything that happens in the room is a small silent 
     stateoftheart surveillance camera

     closeup  video monitor

     showing knox and vicki in the library camera pulls back to 
     reveal that the screen were watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors from this control 
     center we can see everything thats happening in the 
     house

     now we zero in on a single screen guests moving backward 
     with exaggerated speed as a videotape rewinds

     at the panel bruce wayne hits a button and now we see 
     commissioner gordon talking to a uniformed policeman

                              patrolman
                anonymous tip tonight the ace
               chemical company

                              gordon
                     obviously agitated
               good lord it we could put our hands

                              gordon
               eckhardt oh my god 

     and suddenly commissioner gordon is grabbing for his coat 
     the monitor goes black bruce reaches up loosens his tie

     ext ace chemical co  parking lot  night

     unmarked police cars are pulling into the lot headlights 
     off eckhardt circulates among his armed swat team handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a photograph

     the photograph is a fullface shot of jack napier

                              eckhardt
               shoot to kill

     int ace chemical  file room  night

     sparks fly a safecracker in welders mask trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe behind him jacks hoods are 
     at work on the filing cabinets

     the safecracker kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe giving jack a good look at its contents

                              safecracker
                empty

                              hood i

               cleaned out already what do we need
               five men

     jack shakes his head his boys are antsy ready to mutiny 
     by now its depressingly obvious theyve been set up

     then as if they needed any proof  a siren blares 
     outside

     ext ace chemical  night

     eckhardts swat team goes wideeyed as a convoy of police 
     blackandwhites roars into the ace parking lot uniformed 
     cops pile out of their squad cars relieving the swat team 
     eckhardt goes livid as commissioner gordon approaches

                              eckhardt
               what are you trying to do blow the
               collar

               napier will answer to me

     eckhardt tries to slink off gordon grabs him roughly

                              gordon cont
               you stick around

     int ace chemical  that moment

     jack and his hoods ducking out of the office its two 
     stories above the refinery floor accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and catwalks running between the walls

     down below a corrugated metal door begins to rise

                              cop
               freeze!

     one hood goes into a crouch and opens fire half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office looking for a rear 
     exit the others take off across the catwalks

     angle on gordon

     standing in the doorway as his men rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery shots ring 
     out as the hoods scatter

                              eckhardt
                     snidely
               nice work commissioner

                              gordon
               im in charge here not carl
               grissom

     int hallway  that moment

     two hoods run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex theyre almost at the end of the hall when 
     a caped black shadow steps into their path

     it stands there motionless extends its arms  like giant 
     wings  revealing the yellowandblack insigne on its 
     massive chest batman

     one millisecond later the shocked hoods are racing back in 
     the opposite direction

     the batman flings a handful of steel ballbearings across 
     the tiled floor hood i tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard losing his breath hood ii rolls and pulls a gun

     batman hurls a boomerang  its edges scalloped like a 
     bats wing hood ii finds his gun hand pinned to the wall 
     by the twin prongs of the batarang

     the batman strides briskly toward them businesslike 
     taking his time he grabs a handful of hood is hair lifts 
     his head off the floor knees him in the face

     he turns to the petrified hood ii chromesteel talons 
     spring out of his fingertips he strolls past hood ii
     reaching out casually to give him a quick nick on the chin

     hood ii slumps against the wall unconscious

     angle on jack

     down on the floor racing along a wall throwing switches 
      anything to create a diversion with every switch he 
     throws another gigantic machine roars to life centrifuges 
     spin huge polymer extruders spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk overhead chemical tanks rotate into place 
     over giant basins

     jack sees a squad of cops on his tail moving from machine 
     to machine keeping covered he shoots and runs

     angle on catwalks

     blasting away hoods iii and iv scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways keeping down avoiding police fire one of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up

     batman plunges past on the end of a rope a blackgloved 
     hand snatches at hood iiis collar as he climbs and yanks 
     him cleanly off the ladder they drop to the lower catwalk

     hood iv gapes he levels his gun at batman who stands his 
     ground holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support 
     a bullet hits him squarely in the chest he does not fall

     hood iv turns and scrambles batman goes to his belt for a 
     miniature spear gun he points it at hood iv and fires 
     planting a barbed hook in the hoods leg

     angle on cops

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk

                              cop
               look!

                              gordon
               my god its him

     angle on catwalk

     hood iii on his feet now charges batman from behind 
     batman  not even turning to face him  drops hood iii 
     with an elbow now he has a hood on either side

     he takes a steel billy club from his belt whips it once 
     through the air it telescopes out into a fourfoot staff

     like a drum majorette from hell he whirls the staff as the 
     hoods converge on him hood iii takes a debilitating jab 
     under the jaw batman spins on his heels and slams the 
     staff into hood ivs back  knocking him off the catwalk 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     int ace loading bay  that moment

     jack spots a possible out he hits a button on the wall 
     steel doors rise to reveal ace cargo trucks in the parking 
     lot outside beyond the trucks an army of cops waiting 
     for jack to make his move

     no go he turns behind him other cops  the inside team 
      are rushing at him in full riot gear jack ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room

     int chemical supply room  a moment later

     jack sprints through the room firing four shots at the 
     metal chemical tanks on the wall toxic chemicals gush out 
     onto the floor in streams the streams run together 
     begin to smoke and sizzle

     cops right behind him jack cant resist taking one last 
     potshot at a fifth chemical tank

     an explosion knocks him off his feet

     int factory floor  a moment later

     cops look on in puzzlement as a river of chemicals courses 
     out into the main refinery a second later they go up in 
     flames a wall of fire bisects the factory floor

     jack races along behind the spreading wall of flame the 
     cops cant see him now he ducks behind a huge machine 
     hits a switch  and sluice gates open chemical sludge 
     begins to churn a big hole in the wall appears as a gate 
     opens on the east river its the waste dump!

     up on the catwalk batman has a perfect view of jack if 
     jack can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot hell make it to the river batman hooks a rope to 
     his batarang flings it at a catwalk across the floor

     jack bolts bursts through the wall of fire and just as he 
     does 

     batman leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     his foot catches a thirtyfoot roll of plastic six feet in 
     diameter one of several standing upright on the floor the 
     plastic roll drops into jacks path blocking his exit

     an instant later batman lands on top of jack wraps an arm 
     around his throat and raises his free hand drugtipped 
     steel talons appear but before he can paralyze jack 

                              voice
               hold it!

     in all the ruckus hood v has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery now hes got a gun pointed directly at 
     commissioner gordons head

                              hood v
               let him go or ill do it

     batman releases jack and stands back jack chuckles to 
     himself what loyalty then with plenty of time he 
     strolls across the floor to a jacobs ladder mounted on the 
     back wall and begins to climb toward the catwalks

     all action stops batman doesnt move the cops dont move 
     hood v stands there sweating his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for jack to climb safely out of shooting range

     eckhardts piglike eyes glisten his hand drops to his 
     side hes halftempted to pull a gun and get the 
     commissioner plugged

     angle on jack

     at a crouch groping his way along the rail of the catwalk 
     he reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod its a fortyfoot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the east river and freedom

     hes about to climb out when his eye falls on a 38 
     automatic  which lies abandoned on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away

     angle on factory floor

     the hood one arm around gordon with his gun at the 
     commissioners temple he backs slowly toward the door

                              hood v
               nobody makes a move we go out
               clean

                              jacks voice
               eckhardt!!

     all eyes turn to the catwalk overhead where jack stands 
     poised with the 38 in his fist a single shot drops 
     eckhardt cleanly

     the moments distraction is all batman needs he hurls a 
     ninja wheel  a small ratcheted razorsharp disc  at 
     the forearm of hood v one jerk of a thin filament wire  
     a sudden shriek  and gordon is free

     the thug lurches forward his gun drops to the floor 
     discharging accidentally

     an ungodly howl of pain echoes out from the catwalk above 
     jack reels and staggers his hands clutching at his cheeks 
     blood gushes from between his fingers

     jack napier has been shot through the face

     a young cop unnerved by the sight of jacks agonized 
     pirouette draws his gun and opens fire

                              gordon
               no!!

     but the bullet has caught jack in the arm he spins 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk and topples over the 
     cops look on helplessly as jack plunges two stories down 
     into a catch basin full of bubbling toxic waste screaming 
     all the way

                              gordon cont
               goddammit we had him we

     cloud and catches on a catwalk overhead

     the cops are firing wildly into the smoke but its too 
     late at the end of a cord the black majestic figure of 
     the batman whips upward rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel  and disappearing into the shadowy 
     heights safely out of range

               not since the shooting started

                              vicki
               we went there once when i was
               little i played on the beach and
               at nights  they had a band  i
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio
                     shrugging
               that was corto maltese when the war
               broke out i had to go back and i
               promised myself that this time i
               wouldnt look away

                terror

     the conversation is getting rather intense  at both ends 
     vicki seems to have hit some weird chord within bruce

                              bruce
               theres terror everywhere some
               types are just more  familiar
               than others

     for a moment bruce seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar preoccupied mode vicki laughs apologetically

                              vicki
               im sorry i didnt mean to  i
               know it all seems a million miles

     cant quite grasp he seems to be challenging her

               things i dont mean to criticize
               you

               i think you see things very clearly

               else i dont want to be depressing

               do you assume that if i know you
               better i wont like you as much

     if this is a comeon its like no comeon shes ever seen

                              vicki
               im sorry bruce i have to ask are
               you like this with the other women
               you know  because i just cant
               seem to get a handle on this

               vicki if i say anything cryptic or
               ambiguous i think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it because even
               if it doesnt sound that way 
               thats how ill mean it

     also rather touchingly almost childishly sincere before

               to take me jack you may get me
               now but your life wont be worth a
               dime

                              jack
               ive died once already it wasnt so
               bad  in fact i recommend it

     grissom is beginning to panic now its obvious that jack 
     is utterly hopelessly deranged

                              grissom
               jack listen  well cut a deal 

                              jack
               jack jack do i look like a jack

     and now for the first time he flings away the hat rips 
     the muffler from his face and  as grissom gasps in shock 
      stands revealed in his full horrendous glory

     his flesh is bleached bonewhite his hair is a luminous 
     seaweedgreen and his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound twisting his mouth into a hideous 
     perpetual harlequins grin

                              jack cont
               im not a jack any more
                     pause cackling
               you made me a joker!

     the cackle builds into furious hysterical laughter 
     grissom revulsed terrified pushes himself away from the 
     desk back toward the window which overlooks the city

                              grissom
               jack  im warning you wipe that
               lunatic grin off your face

                              jack
               ha! thats the best part i cant!!

     and with that jack pulls the trigger and fires and fires 
     again until the clip is empty

     ext grissoms building  night

     we tilt up the chromeandglass facade of the skyscraper 
     arriving finally at the top floor a plate glass window 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where jacks bullets hit

     int grissoms penthouse  that moment  night

     the room is still dark jack  or as well know him from 
     this moment on the joker  sits in grissoms swivel 
     chair staring out at the moondrenched skyline

                              joker
               what a view our little city it
               always brings a smile to my face

     he reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     grissom  who lies dead on the floor the towel still 
     wrapped around him the joker laughs softly to himself

                              joker cont
               guess its my little city now
               wonder what itll look like when i

     int bruce waynes bedroom  morning

     the sun is just up and vicki finds herself alone in bed a 
     soft offkey baritone voice drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom bruce in the shower singing honeysuckle rose

     she breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed somehow 
     shes wound up wearing bruces ribbed formal shirt

     int bathroom  a moment later  morning

     bruce in his opulent deco shower stall still singing to 
     himself vicki sneaks up behind him opens the door he 
     instantly stops singing  as if hes been hit by a brick

                              vicki
               i didnt mean to scare you i just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing

     she smiles teasing him he doesnt respond he acts as if 
     shes caught him doing something shameful  exposed him

                              vicki cont
                     singing

               sugar 
                     no response from bruce
               bruce you are such a case

     bruce seems somehow unable to sing along but be quickly 
     recovers his composure  and forces a crooked almost 
     childish smile

                              bruce
               i dont sing very well

                              vicki
               then theres one thing in the world

               what it is  now youll have to
               kill me

     he kisses her good morning steps out and reaches for a 
     towel his body is one big mass of bruises and abrasions

     apartment building on the east side of gotham through the 
     glass doors we see alicia outside in the chill wind 
     peering inside hesitant to enter

     as silently as possible she uses her key and steps in 
     tiptoeing past the doorman trying not to wake him shes 
     almost made it when he sits bolt upright startling her

                              voice
               honey  im home!

     she pivots her eyes widen she shrieks

     sitting crosslegged in an easy chair a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face is the joker hes in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers reading the paper a dry martini at his side

     this grim parody of domesticity sends poor alicia into a 
     dead faint

     int penthouse suite  day

     it looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom at a 
     long table sit gothams most distinguished criminals 
     ganglords and rackets bosses from every corner of the city 
     they stare suspiciously at the head of the table

                              joker os
               so thats how it is gents until
               grissom decides its safe to come up
               for air im running the show

     now we see what they see the joker dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat his face is layered with 
     fleshtoned makeup and his hairs been rinsed black

     unfortunately he cant conceal his ghoulish smile

                              gang boss
               so why dont we hear this from

     carmine rotelli an especially oily mobster speaks up

               grissom and i especially dont like

                              joker
               thats it

     the joker extends a hand rotelli reaches out to shake it 
     he doesnt see the joy buzzer concealed in the jokers 
     palm

     40000 volts course through rotellis body he drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk smoke pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar

     the crimelords recoil in horror before they can make a 
     move a squad of armed thugs burst into the room

                              joker cont
               looks like carmine got a little hot
               under the collar

                              crimelord
                youre insane!

     the joker is a wee bit agitated he removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow exposing a patch of chalkwhite 
     flesh  to the great bewilderment of the onlookers

                              joker
               thats what they said about lee
               iacocca now get out of here  and
               think it over!

     the sickened criminals file out cautiously that leaves the 
     joker alone in the room with the charred corpse of rotelli 
     the joker sinks into a chair and  as is his wont  
     addresses the stiff

                to tell you the truth id just
               about given up waiting

               much like someone i used to

     he stops and laughs she smiles crookedly takes his arm

     another angle  across plaza  that moment

     philly ricorso  another crimelord from the boardroom  
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of paid bodyguards

     on bruce and vicki

     a painted street mime walks alongside them feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall vicki groans

                              vicki
               all street mimes should be executed

                              bruce
                looks like a convention

     and indeed there are half a dozen street mimes converging 
     on the center of the plaza

     ricorso and co approach the mirroredglass entrance of a 
     skyscraper in the lobby a mime  whos been annoying the 
     passersby  throws a bolt locking the doors from inside

     a bodyguard bangs on the glass nearby another mime 
     reaches into a trash bin  and pulls out a machine gun

     sudden screams of terror from the onlookers

     vicki turns to bruce before she can get his name out hes 
     hoisted her bodily and thrown her behind a marble fountain

     series of shots

     bruces eyes darting birdlike around the plaza  intercut 
     with the following pov shots all in slow motion

         two mimes with machine guns one of them lining philly 
          and co up against the glass doors the other holding 
          the crowd at bay

         a woman in the crowd fainting a third mime gleefully 
          imitating her swoon to no ones amusement

         philly and his goons cowering hands in the air as 
          other mimes cruelly mimic their terrified poses 

      and suddenly bruce is running frantically looking for 
     a secluded spot an alleyway anything no go hes out in 
     the open with onlookers everywhere in his civvies hes 
     just another citizen totally impotent

     he darts around a corner backs against a wall women 
     children grown men race past no privacy hes 
     practically quaking now in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety he looks up at the sky overhead terrified

     a brilliant sun bears down on him as machine guns chatter

     angle on philly and bodyguards

     bodies jerking as glass rains down in shards

     angle on bruce

     his back arched his mouth agape his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza its 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him

     a moment later its all over but the screaming vicki 
     emerges from the crowd and finds bruce slumped against the 
     wall nearly catatonic she moves to touch him

     as if by reflex he reaches out and grabs her by the arms  
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone she gasps looks 
     up  and sees in his traumatized eyes a look so raw so 
     desperate that it virtually defies comprehension

                              vicki
               bruce!!

     he blinks rapidly he relaxes his grip before vickis 
     eyes hes changing becoming the bruce she knows

                              bruce
               oh my god are you all right

     he reaches for her involuntarily she steps back

     he sees her reaction and his face goes slack  frightened 
     pleading this time she lets him embrace her but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt

     more significantly an old contract dating back to the mid

     results of preliminary experimentation across its title

     and finally a sheaf of photos laboratory apes chimps and
     orangutans all dead their lips are drawn back exposing

     on one wall postersized blowups of the grinning apes

     on the opposite wall a largescale photographic

               called her agent

     the joker nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor like a happy kindergartener with paste pot and 
     scissors hes clipping photos from a magazine  horrible 
     scenes of death destruction panic mutilation

     one by one hes pasting these shots on the blowup of 
     gotham city  all along sidewalk level  creating a

     unnatural involuntary vicki sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong lays a hand on claires arm

     smoke is billowing out of an airconditioning vent

     trays of food crash to the floor as waiters pass out art 
     lovers drop forks go face down in their pasta salad

     vicki hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth 
     within seconds shes the only one conscious in the room

     int museum  that moment

     green smoke plumes up toward the ceiling as we tilt down 
     toward the floor of the atrium patrons and security guards 
     lie sprawled on the floor twisted at odd angles out cold

     the mist is beginning to clear now the doors swing open 
     and in strolls the joker looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and big purple pimps hat

     a squad of goons enters behind him some of them are 
     carrying large cartons they lock the entry doors place a 
     closed sign in front of them and begin uncrating large 
     cans of black paint

     the joker steps up onto the ramp examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye

                              joker
               okay boys lets broaden our minds

     he stops in front of an ingres odalisque stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look then pulls out a straight 
     razor and cuts a long diagonal gash in the canvas

     he ambles up the ramp stepping over collapsed patrons 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting monet water 
     lilies a degas ballerina  all get the razor treatment 
     behind him his cronies work their way up the ramp heaving 
     black paint on every canvas the joker has missed

     he cocks an eyebrow at edvard munchs the scream

                              joker cont
               i kinda like this one leave it

     int tea room  a moment later  evening

     vicki at her table still wearing the gas mask scared as 
     hell the overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark 
     the joker saunters over and pulls up a chair

                              joker
               i think its safe to take that off

     vicki recognizes the deranged smile instantly she removes 
     the gas mask tries to gather her wits

                              joker cont

               unfortunate but i think we can work
               around it

     he sets a couple of candlesticks on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter a long jet of flame shoots out jerry 
     lewisstyle as he lights the candles

                              joker cont

     she nods he opens it begins leafing through the record of 
     vickis career newspaper photos from the globe at first
     then fashion layouts magazine covers of celebrities 
     artier b&w shots from vickis first couple of exhibitions

                              joker cont

               armless screaming fellows you
               know the atrocities
                     smirking
               somehow when you shoot it it all
               comes out so clean so lovely

     vicki is squirming but she doesnt think it wise to debate 
     the point not with this lunatic anyway

                              joker cont
               i guess im just an old cornball
               but i live for beauty i look
               around at my little city it gets me
               down
                     indicating the photos
               we dont have anything like this
               well it came to me that what this
               city needs is beautification kind
               of a big makeover
                     enraptured
               miss vale i finally realized that
               one man can make a difference you
               know the saying in his image 
               created he them

     vicki gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary 
     getting more frightened by the minute

                              vicki
               and you want a 

                              joker
               a visual record yes a beforeand
               after kind of thing
                     leaning closer
               this could make your reputation

     her first impulse is to get up and run but she fights the 
     impulse she wont run not until she gets this maniac
     on film she reaches for her camera bag

                              vicki
               maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist people might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup

                              joker
                     momentarily puzzled
                behind the makeup

     then it sinks in by candlelight in the darkened 
     restaurant with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job he looks practically normal vicki must think shes
     looking at his real face!

                              joker cont
               oh yes i see what you mean

     he finds a pitcher pours a glass of water and very 
     carefully sets it on the table in front of vicki then  
     suddenly inexplicably  he barks at her

                              joker cont
               silly little twit  i cant take
               you anywhere!

     he sits back and grins expectantly vicki is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst a moment passes

     he obviously wants her to do something but she hasnt
     got a clue as to what it is growing impatient now he 
     points at the water glass

                              joker cont
               well what are you waiting for

     now vicki gets the point she picks up the glass and hurls 
     its contents in the jokers face

     his hands go up he writhes he shrieks  like the wicked 
     witch of the west dissolving he reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean and begins to cackle

     his awful whiteandgreen clowns face revealed behind the 
     running makeup he leers at her

                              joker cont
               you see miss vale  that was my
               makeup
                     leaning forward
               what do you think

     vicki is repulsed but shes determined to tough it out

                              vicki
               ive seen worse much worse

                              joker
               strong stomach huh i like that in
               a woman  maybe we can do business
               after all

     he seems to have calmed down a bit its almost as if hes 
     coming on to her but just then a tiny bell sounds behind 
     them and a voice intrudes

                              voice
               jack

     the joker turns alicia steps out of a rooftop elevator and 
     moves toward them drugged wraithlike shes still wearing 
     the porcelain dolls mask we saw earlier

                              joker
                     to vicki

                     rolling his eyes at
                      vicki

               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming

     vicki cant take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room

                              vicki
                     hesitantly
                why the mask

                              joker
               alicia! come here have a seat show
               miss vale why you wear the mask

     alicia sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask

                              joker cont
               you see miss vale alicias beautiful
               one in a million a work of art in 
               fact 

     were looking at alicias profile as the mask comes off 
     the side thats turned to us is indeed beautiful but the 
     side we cant see sends vicki right over the edge

                              joker cont
               she makes you look sick

     vicki lurches out of her seat knocking it over her face 
     frozen in horror she finds her camera holds it out like a 
     weapon as the joker advances on her

                              vicki
               you scum! you sick filth! you did
               that to her!

                              joker
               what i improved her a little 

     vicki backs away snapping the shutter on her camera he 
     blinks as the flash gun goes off repeatedly

                              vicki
               ill see you burn ill see you dead
                get away from me!!

                              joker
               miss vale was it something i said
                     brightly
               do you want to sniff my flower

     theres a bright purple boutonniere in his lapel he holds 
     it up for vickis inspection as he moves menacingly closer

                              vicki
               no!

     the joker squeezes a concealed bulb a jet of clear liquid 
     spurts out of the flower narrowly missing vicki

     she gasps bumps into a table acrid black smoke rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit acid

                              joker
               come on miss vale stop and smell
               the roses!!

     he backs vicki into a corner and then  abruptly 

     a skylight shatters in a hail of glass! a caped shadow 
     drops to the floor of the restaurant! and the joker is face 
     to face with 

     the batman!

     on his wrist is a steel gauntlet ha aims it at the joker 
     like a weapon then pivots suddenly  points his arm 
     through the door of the restaurant 

      and fires a metal spike into the adobe wall of the ramp 
     outside!!

                              joker cont
                you!!

     on the end of the spike is a cord leading to batmans belt 
     in the wink of an eye hes grabbed vicki  dragged her out 
     of the tea room  and plunged over the ramp wall four 
     stories straight down to the atrium floor below!!!

     the joker races to the edge of the ramp

                              joker cont
               get em!! get em!!

     his goons are stationed at various points along the ramp 
     still defacing masterpieces they pull their guns and open 
     fire as batman and vicki plummet past

     angle on batman and vicki  as they fall

     he holds the gauntlet overhead rope whistling through it 
     as we watch the gauntlet sprouts steel wings  forming a 
     bulletproof shield over their heads!

     two feet above the marble floor the rope jerks them up 
     short  like a bunjee cord guns blaze as batman and vicki 
     drop safely to earth and make for the exit

     the doors are locked batman spots the black closed sign 
     on a metal stand he heaves it through the glass doors

     vicki hustles through he points her to a side alley

     ext side alley  that moment  dusk

     vicki rounds the corner just as batman lobs a smoke pellet 
     into the doorway of the fluegelheim

                              batman
               get in the car!

                              vicki
               which car

     vicki suddenly feels quite stupid because  while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley  there is only 
     one batmobile

                              vicki cont
                oh

     the batmobile is sleek futuristic and well 
     indescribable imagine your own vicki climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry

                              batman
               ignition!

     as batman sprints down the alley a computer display on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint a tinny 
     synthesized voice repeats the command

                              computer
               ignition

     the engines are revving up even as batman vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside vicki

     guns in hand the jokers goons are stumbling out of the 
     fluegelheim hacking coughing blinded by smoke they dive 
     for their lives as the batmobile comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour

     the joker emerges just as the batmobile careens off

                              joker
               i want him!! i want him!!

     the joker climbs into the back of a van labelled monarch 
     playing cards  half his goons pile into the van behind 
     him the other half into a second car nearby

     ext streets  that moment

     sirens howl as police cars converge on the flugelheim

     int batmobile  that moment

     roaring out into city traffic

                              vicki
               look! police!

                              batman

                              vicki
               shouldnt we 

     a police car whizzes past the batmobile tires skid the 
     cop car does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     batmobile batman floors the accelerator in response

     int van  that moment

     tight on the demented face of the joker a goon calls out 
     from the front of the van

                              goon
               there they are! dead ahead!

     the joker screams into a radio dispatchers mike

                              joker
               all units! southbound on riverview!

     series of shots

     intersection nearly causing a pileup the jokers van 
     makes short work of a sabretts hot dog stand in its path

     int batmobile  that moment

     pedestrians gawk as the sleek supercar rips up the 
     pavement

                              vicki
               what about her what about the girl

                              batman
               he wont kill her
                     gritting his teeth
               goddammit!

     theyre moving up on an empty block  a night construction 
     team a huge piece of heavy machinery backs up slowly and 
     inexorably blocking the intersection

     batman guns the engine swerves left tries to slide past 
     and hits the brakes  stopping inches short of a headon 
     collision with a lamppost

     he jumps out of the car no chance to get through the 
     jokers van is two blocks back and coming up fast

     onlookers and construction workers are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them

                              vicki
               cant we

                     as she scrambles out
               shields!!

     the batmobiles computerized voice replies

                              computer
               shields

     with a series or clangs chromesteel plates slide into 
     place  across the cockpit over the tires  leaving the 
     batmobile an inert impenetrable block of black metal

     batman and vicki sprint through the construction site 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble

     int van  moving  night

     three police cars red lights blazing overtake the jokers 
     van and bear down on the abandoned batmobile

                              goon at wheel
               are they ours

                              joker

     the van does a discreet uturn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street

     ext side street  that moment  night

     batman and vicki zigzag past storefronts and candy stands 
     dodging astonished pedestrians

     int car  moving  that moment

     four goons with guns they spot batman and vicki coming off 
     the side street goon i the driver speaks into a radio

                              goon i

     ext street  that moment  night

     batman and vicki race down the sidewalk the car is gaining 
     on them and then from behind 

     batman and vicki are caught in a spray of bullets they 
     dive drop behind a parked car and dont come up

     theyve ducked into a blind alley

     int alleyway  night

     hunkered on the pavement they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley vicki sighs in relief batman  still 
     alert his muscles tensed  puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm he looks overhead sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up

                              batman
               how much do you weigh

                              vicki
                a hundred and eight

     he does some quick mental calculations a beat then the 
     car reappears  backing up  blocking their only avenue 
     of escape batman unfurls a rope heaves a batarang upward 
     and grabs vicki roughly about the waist

                              batman
               hang on!

     the jokers thugs pile out of the car the batarang catches 
     on the catwalk and batman triggers the springaction reel 
     on his utility belt  jerking him and vicki into the air

     bullets zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line 
     one story two stories and then 

     they slow they stop they dangle in midair as the jokers 
     goons advance batman wriggles twists they lurch upward 
     another few feet  and stop again vicki screams

     her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism theyre
     stranded two stories up  sitting ducks

                              batman cont
               whatever happens  dont let go!!

     in the wink of an eye hes detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around vickis belt before she has a 
     chance to protest he lets go

     vicki rockets upward at blinding speed shrieking all the 
     way batman his cape billowing plummets downward

     vicki slams up into the catwalk and bobs on the end of the 
     line as batman lands with a loud crash overturning a row 
     of garbage cans the goons are on him in a flash  one per 
     limb random kicking and flailing batman manages to slam 
     two goons into a wall but before he can get to his feet 

      goon #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull

     batman is down for the count the thugs dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form still wary

     the lead thug holds his colleagues back draws his gun and 
     fires two shots pointblank at the yellowandblack 
     insigne on batmans chest the body jerks

     they move closer and stop

                              goon i
                no blood

                              goon ii
               jesus

                              goon iii
               wait a minute

     goon iii screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body he examines the batmans tunic and rips it open

                              goon iv
                what is that

                              goon iii
               some kind of body armor

                              goon i
               hes human after all  take that
               mask off

     ext rooftop  on vicki

     five stories overhead vicki has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building she watches transfixed as 
     the thugs bend over to remove batmans cowl but at this 
     height  and this angle  she cant see his face on a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her camera bag

     angle on goons

     peeringdown openmouthed at the unconscious face of bruce 
     wayne blood seeps from bruces left nostril

                              goon i
               well who is this guy

                              goon ii
               i dunno you seen him before

                              goon iii
               maybe hes got some kind of id

                              goon iv
               good idea lets check his wallet

                              goon i
               well worry about it later plug
               him
                        beat
               in the head

     goon ii draws his automatic and at that very instant a 
     flash gun explodes overhead

     startled the thugs look up another camera flash

                              goon iii
               goddam its the redhead!

     on vicki

     a chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     goons open fire she ducks back behind the overhang holds 
     the camera out over the ledge and keeps on flashing

     on bruce

     his eyes wink open

     on vicki

     momentarily idle shes used up her roll the goons keep 
     shooting as she reaches in her bag for new film she finds 
     it loads the camera with astonishing dexterity  and 
     then on instinct reaches back inside the bag for a 
     telephoto lens all the better to see you with batman 

     on the thugs

     no response from vicki they begin to relax a little

                              goon ii
               did you hit her

                              goon i
               who cares wax that freak

     they turn their attention to bruce a gloved hand snakes 
     out with lightning speed  grabbing goon i by the coattail 
     and pulling him directly into the line of fire goon ii bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows whats happened

     in one fluid motion bruce heaves goon is lifeless body 
     through the air knocking goon ii backward over a garbage 
     can goon ii falls and cracks his head on the nearest wall

     goon iii takes a rabbit punch to the throat hes on the 
     way down when he catches a steeltoed boot in the gut

     four seconds after all this began bruce is alone in the 
     alleyway with goon iv goon iv has his gun pointed right at 
     bruce but hes shaking too much to pull the trigger

     bruce smiles goon iv screams and runs for his life

     through all this vickis telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge snapping away bruce looks up at the flash 
     gun and shakes his head he bends to retrieve his cowl

     on vicki

     she finally dares to peek down at the alley limp goons 
     everywhere and in addition the batman  leaping up 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape climbing up to meet 
     her

     vicki thinks fast she may have a clean shot of batmans 
     face she advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll then drops it down her blouse

     but batman is likely to want that roll so she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof away from the 
     alley she should have a minute or so before be gets there

     its a threefoot drop to the next roof over vicki 
     clambers down and quickens her pace tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps

     then somehow  and shell be damned if she can figure out 
     how  she walks smack into the batman and gasps

                              batman
                not even a thank you

                              vicki
               well  i think you might consider
               thanking me you were good as
               dead

                              batman
               thats because you lied about your
               weight
                     a long pause
               thank you

     vicki nods and tries to walk past him he grabs her arm

                              batman cont
               ill have to ask you for that film

                              vicki
               i just wanted to distract them i
               wasnt trying to get a picture of
               you

     batman looks down at the camera hanging from her neck the 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches vicki gulps

                              batman
               please

                              vicki
               i wont let you have it

     the batman is amused he smiles menacingly

                              vicki cont

               take it but the jokers on that
               same roll i 

                              batman

               were as good as dead so 

                              vicki
               look i appreciate what you did for
               me but this is my job and im
               keeping those pictures

                              batman

               jokers and ill keep the rest

                              batman
               because ill take you with me

     he reaches out holds her gently by the shoulders his 
     voice is deep and soothing true vicki is a little dizzy 
     from all thats happened but shes undeniably drawn to 
     him

     still cautious though she reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film the original roll  not the telephoto
     shots which are still stashed in her blouse

                              batman cont
               thank you vicki

                              vicki
                where are you going to take me

     no reply she looks up into his mirrored eyes he pulls her 
     closer to him brushes back her hair runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek 

      and breaks a tiny capsule under her nose vicki slumps 
     into batmans arms

                                                 cut to

     ext alleyway  night

     street level batman emerges carrying vickis inert form in 
     his arms he pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the batmobile two blocks down

     the car is still there the chromesteel shields intact 
     but dozens of cops and curiosityseekers are swarming all 
     over the fearsome machine

     batman snorts in frustration an enormous threeton 
     caterpillar winch rumbles up the street toward the 
     batmobile

     hes about to get towed batman takes a radio transmitter
     from his utility belt and speaks into it

                              batman
               shields open

     ext street  on batmobile

     two cops are crawling along the hood of the car from 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice

                              computer
               shields open

     the steel plates begin to retract

                              batman vo
                     over radio
               ignition

                              computer
               ignition

     the stunned cops gaze into the batmobiles cockpit

                              cop
               theres somebody in there!

     they tumble off the hood as the turbine engines roar to 
     life and the batmobile begins to move

     cops and onlookers quickly clear a path they stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto picks up speed and advances 
     toward the end of the block the left turn signal flashes 
     dutifully and the batmobile vanishes around the corner

     pandemonium breaks loose as the cops bolt for their cars

     ext street  night

     sirens wail passersby stare slackjawed at the driverless 
     batmobile as it tears down the street passing darting 
     dodging buses and cutting off taxis  all with a squad of 
     cop cars in hot pursuit

     ext alleyway  night

     batman sees the batmobile rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway he takes vicki in his arms 
     and steps directly into the path of the onrushing 
     headlights

                              batman
               stop!

     brakes squeal the batmobile stops one yard short of batman 
     and vicki a moment later batman is at the wheel

     sirens build lights flash the cop cars are now visible 
     behind them batman floors the pedal the batmobiles 
     powerful afterburners kick in and the hapless cops kill 
     their sirens as batman zooms off into the night at 140 mph

                                                 dissolve to

     ext back road  night

     a deserted stretch of road lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side the batmobile roars past

     int batmobile  night

     vicki is gradually coming to on the passengers side

                              vicki
                how long have i been out

                              batman
               quite a while i took the scenic
               route

                              vicki
                     gazing around her
               well ive certainly enjoyed it
               whats that

     hes just hit a button on the dashboard

                              batman
               garage door

     ext road  that moment  night

     at the side of the road a fallen tree surrounded by 
     underbrush rises hydraulically into the air  revealing a 
     secret road invisible from the main thoroughfare

     doing sixty the batmobile makes a hairpin turn seconds 
     later the fallen tree drops back magically into place

     int batmobile  a moment later  night

     as they cruise down the hidden road vicki studies batmans 
     face knoxs words are very much on her mind

                              vicki
               i meant to ask you up on the roof
                how did you know my name

     batman smiles in response vicki smiles with him

                              vicki cont
               im serious how did you know

     no reply vicki frowns looks through the windshield and 
     sees  much to her horror  an enormous sheer cliff wall 
     looming dead ahead

     wideeyed she looks at batman still smiling he hits the 
     gas  speeding up she lets out a scream

     angle on cliff wall

     one second to impact suddenly the cliff wall vanishes 
     altogether  revealing in its place the gaping mouth of 
     an underground cavern

     the batmobile zooms through a moment later the cliff wall 
      which is nothing more than a holographic projection  
     winks back into existence showing no trace of the cavern

     int batcave  night

     we all know this place although we havent had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos  the dinosaur the giant 
     penny  the batcave is unmistakable vast banks of 
     blinking computers a stateoftheart crime lab a fully
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys its the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for

     batman climbs out of the car he removes his cape strips 
     off his bulletriddled jersey and his body armor there are 
     two big bruises on the center of his chest

     vicki looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic  one of four she wanders over to 
     examine the row of batsuits  and the body armor

                              vicki
               what is this stuff kevlar

                              batman
               better its not on the market yet

                              vicki
               it doesnt protect your head
               though

                              batman
               thats why i wear a target on my
               chest

     the batman takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelors pad his tone is jokey almost 
     flirtatious behind the mask hes a lot looser more 
     carefree than some guys we could name 

      like bruce wayne

     vicki is to put it mildly awed she wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars worth of equipment

                              vicki
               howd you find this place

                              batman
               stumbled across it when i was a boy

     vickis head jerks up abruptly in the dim recesses 
     overhead bats are screaming she shivers

                              batman cont
               they dont come down here theyre
               afraid of the lights

                              vicki
               i dont like bats not that kind

                              batman
               they used to terrify me but i
               forced myself to keep coming back
               and 
                     smiling
                i guess i became the thing i
               feared the most ill do your photos
               now

     he goes to a highspeed photo processing machine  the 
     kind they have at fotomat only better  and loads the 
     roll

     vicki wanders over to the edge of a deep black pit she 
     kicks a pebble over long seconds pass no sound

     she looks up suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of gymnasts rings this guy is dedicated

                              vicki
               who pays for all this

                              batman
               i have sponsors

                              vicki
               the computers

                              batman

               products there is a pattern

                              vicki
               no more makeup  looks like well
               all be showing our true faces now

     she looks straight at him its almost a direct request 
     but batman is preoccupied with the matter at hand

                              batman
               ive tracked all the records every
               shipment every warehouse every
               loading dock nothing no
               opportunities for tampering somehow
               the joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients at the source

                              vicki
               wait you can just tap into any
               corporate database you want
               anywhere

                              batman
               oh no i let the fbi do that then
               i tap into the fbi  your photos
               are ready

     he holds up a hand to vicki stand back then he checks out 
     the pictures  smiling as he shuffles through the prints

                              vicki
               you couldve killed him you know
               you could have killed the joker

                              batman
               i had to save you vicki
                     turning to face her
               here you go i think ill let you
               keep the whole set

     she looks at the photos joker joker joker and four 
     shots of the batman in action hes without his mask but 
     theres no clean angle on his face

     vicki doesnt quite know why but her head is reeling

                              batman cont
               care for an autograph

     he takes one of the prints scrawls on it hands it to her 
     with the inscription to vicki love b

     now he turns to shut down the photo machine vicki is 
     trembling her hand goes to her belt finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse she steps up silently behind 
     him reaches for his cowl at the last second she stops

                              vicki
                bruce

     he freezes in place for an indecisive moment then

                              batman
               are you talking to me

     he turns in seeming incomprehension and shows her a 
     smile the same crooked curious childlike smile she saw 
     on bruces face that morning when she caught him singing

                              batman cont
               maybe weve had enough for one
               night ill take you home

     almost in a trance now she lets him lead her to the 
     batmobile as she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another knockout capsule

                              batman cont
               dont be afraid im here

     she takes one last look at the familiar smile beneath the 
     mask then breaks the capsule and breathes deep

     flame erupts from the rear of the batmobile as the after
     burners kick in and batman screeches off a fiery red glow 
     fills the screen burning out the image as we

                                                 dissolve to

     ext gotham street  1963  night dream sequence

     the red glow resolves itself into a dreamlike street scene 
     liquid weightless figures moving in a tinted soundless 
     cityscape as distant tinkly carnival music plays 
     underneath were outside a theatre watching firstnighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical

     in the crowd we pick out three figures dr thomas wayne 
     his wife martha and  in thomass arms  their young son 
     bruce bruce hasnt made it through the show hes asleep 
     head nestled peacefully against his fathers shoulder

     thomas rouses the boy gently sets him down on the 
     sidewalk bruce rubs the sleep from his eyes as thomas puts 
     an arm around his wife together they begin walking

     in a single cut the crowd has disappeared and the waynes 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street thomas and 
     martha are laughing making jokes reaching down to tousle 
     bruces hair their faces as they draw closer are full of 
     joy and then without warning 

     a handgun enters frame

     the waynes freeze in their tracks thomas steps 
     protectively in front of his wife reaches for his wallet 
     begins unbuckling his watch he wont put up a fight

     marthas hand goes involuntarily to the pearl necklace at 
     her throat

     the gunman sees it gestures for her to hand it over but 
     martha is paralyzed afraid to move

     the gunman steps past thomas snatches at the necklace

     the instant his wife is threatened thomas attacks the 
     pearl strand breaks in the gunmans hand as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk

     a silent burst of flame erupts from the muzzle of the gun

     thomas crumples martha emits a piercing shriek  a shriek 
     we cannot hear 

      a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame

     bruce stands paralyzed in shock the gunman scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk reaches for marthas 
     purse and rises slowly  his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy

     almost catatonic bruce stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents at their hands somehow intertwined at the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them

     he looks up with a gaze so bleak so petrifying that the 
     gunman turns and runs

     and we cut to an exact reproduction of the pulitzer prize
     winning photo the cops bent over the bodies the medics 
     with their stretchers the boy bruce his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of officer gordon

     theres only one difference bruces head is turned away 
     from us we cant see his face

     and now a hand enters the frame much like the gunmans 
     hand but feminine beckoning bruce hearing his name 
     looks up then agonized ashamed he buries his face in 
     gordons side gordon gestures angrily at the intruder

     but the hand keeps beckoning and ultimately bruce turns 
     showing us the tearstained face from the famous photo a
     face slack with horror the horror of his parents death 
     and more importantly the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments

     at last we see what bruce sees a woman crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby the woman is holding a camera the woman 
     is smiling prettily at bruce

     the woman is vicki vale

     a flashbulb explodes filling the screen with its blinding 
     white light scorching out the image as a harsh ringing 
     sound cuts through the silence

     concert onstage five elvis imitators dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits 
     representing the king in progressive stages of 
     deterioration

     int vickis apartment  dusk

               much good for people as bruce

     he sinks back on the sofa closes his eyes hes had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times

                              bruce
               money makes money vicki the
               foundation runs itself  im

               everybody

               what it i could save a handful
                what if i could save one

     vicki is sick of watching bruce torment himself she stands 
     up almost crying now and accuses him directly

                              vicki
               bruce at the rate youre going you
               cant even save yourself

                              bruce
                     staring right at her
               sometimes i dont know if theres
               enough of me left to save

     vicki is totally drained she heads for the kitchen

                              vicki
               oh god ive got to have some
               coffee or something

     a moments breather as bruce sits on the sofa reflecting 
     then suddenly a knock at the door

     vicki reappears and moves to answer the door bruce  on 
     his feet instantly  grabs her by the shoulder

                              bruce
               are you expecting anyone

     she nods no he goes to the peephole in the door

                              bruce cont
               whos there

     through the peephole he sees a delivery boy

               package tor miss vale

                              bruce
               set it down by the door on the
               lefthand side

     the delivery boy sets the package down and wanders off 
     tipless muttering something about cheap shits after a 
     moments interval bruce opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package

     another brownpaper parcel addressed in crayon

                              vicki
               bruce!

     he strides past her handling the parcel gingerly and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter

                              vicki cont
               its just like the last time he
               sent me a present before he 

                              bruce
               very thoughtful dont touch it

     as vicki watches he goes into the livingroom and finds 
     his alligator attache case he opens the case removes a 
     laptop computer and a handful of business papers then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his utility belt

                              vicki
               oh bruce dont tell me you carry
               it around with you

                              bruce
               i feel naked without it

     he takes out a tiny ultrasound scanner  rather like a 
     stethoscope with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be  and runs it over the package

                              bruce cont
               not a bomb but it could be rigged
               wait in the next room

     he takes a small gas mask from his belt puts it on then 
     slits the wrapping with a steak knife

     nothing cautiously he pulls back the flaps the box is 
     full of styrofoam popcorn bruce shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn and extracts a human ear

     in the doorway behind him vicki lets out a squeal

     bruce grabs the box and dumps two dozen ears on the 
     counter

                              bruce
                theyre wax

     vicki finds a handscrawled note among the ears

                              vicki

               that does it its going to be this
               weekend

     the kitchen phone rings vicki reaches for the receiver 
     her eyes go wide and she gestures him over

                              vicki
                where are you calling from

     as vicki struggles to keep the conversation alive bruce 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his laptop 
     computer he plugs it in flips open the screen punches up 
     a telecommunications program

     a moment later vicki enters from the kitchen

                              vicki

               off the line

     he freezes hes heard something in the hallway outside

     int hallway  that moment

     elevator doors open on three thugs one of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on vickis floor the key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys

     the key ring belongs to a doorman whos riding in the 
     elevator with the jokers trio of thugs hes dead alas 
     the thugs dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward vickis apartment

     int vickis apartment  a moment later

     bruce is nowhere in sight vicki is at the sink washing 
     dishes acting nonchalant she pretends not to hear the 
     door unlocking behind her

     she turns  and faces the three advancing thugs

                              thug i
               hi miss vale lets not put up a
               fight huh cause wed hate to have
               to 

     bruce steps into the doorway behind them with a single 
     sweep of the arm he flings three drugtipped ninja wheels 
     at the thugs catching one in the neck one in the 
     shoulder one in the hip they collapse in quick 
     succession

                              bruce
               theres a garage in this building

     vicki nods yes bruce  all business now that hes in his 
     element  disappears into vickis bedroom

     she peeks around the corner he reemerges carrying a black 
     nylon stocking which he stuffs into his pocket vicki is 
     full of question but he shushes her before she can speak

                              bruce cont
               ive got to take him out now

     he stoops down beside the thugs and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring  which he then tosses to vicki

                              bruce cont
               pick an apartment and stay there
               and listen call the police give
               them that address every available
               man

     he starts out the door stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded vicki in his arms for a kiss

     int underground garage  a moment later  evening

     the jokers van bearing the monarch playing card logo two 
     armed goons lean against the hood they watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out

     bruce pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs head down whistling as he walks around the van 
     his hand brushes against it  leaving a magnetized homing 
     device almost too tiny to notice stuck to the fender

     he walks another six paces then stops short he feels 
     around in all his pockets making a big show of having
     forgotten something

                              bruce
               oh hell!

     the goons eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator the doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss

                              goon
               hey boss somethings up the
               elevators working

     int van  on joker

     frustrated snarling ready to throw a tantrum

                              joker
               dammit! you cant get good help
               these days  lets move out

     from high above the street we see the jokers van pulling 
     out of vickis building were up on the roof with bruce 
     he hits a button on his utility belt and a red signal 
     light begins to flash

     bruce clamps the utility belt around his waist pulls the 
     black nylon stocking over his head and suddenly hes 
     bounding across the rooftops in pursuit of the joker

     ext cross street  a moment later  evening

     the van turns right at the intersection nothing unusual 
     but for some reason pedestrians are pointing at the sky 
     staring goggleeyed at the rooftops

     far above them a man  dressed in a suit a tie a yellow 
     belt and a black stocking mask  is gliding across the 
     intersection on a rope

     int van  a moment later

     the van driver guns through a red light brakes squeal on 
     either side in the back of the van the joker growls

                              joker
               slow down you maniac!

     ext intersection  that moment  evening

     as the van roars past a mounted policeman shakes his fist 
     his horse shies rears back turns in a circle hes just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a man in a stocking 
     mask plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horses back

     bruce elbows the startled cop now theres only one rider 
     the van turns left bruce gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection hoping to cut the joker off

     int alicia hunts apartment  that moment

     alicia peers out through the window on the street below 
     unmarked cars are converging

     int van  that moment

     the joker and co are two blocks away from alicias they 
     see a police swat team sealing off the building

                              driver
               boss! jesus! theyve 

                              joker

     ext side street  that moment  evening

     bruce on horseback charging past elegant old brownstones 
     drawing stares from passersby we get a quick look at the 
     flashing red signal light on his belt

     ext riverview drive  that moment  evening

     a yellow vw bug rips up the street at 70 mph

     int volkswagen bug  that moment

     we cant see the driver but we do see on the seat 
     beside him a video display with a shifting grid map of the 
     city  and on it a flashing signal blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on bruces belt

     ext side street  that moment

     bruce sees the vw bug rounding the corner and streaking 
     toward him he reins in the horse it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose the bug zooms past 

      and alfred the butler heaves out a brown laundry bundle 
     neatly tied in string

     bruce snatches it out of the air gives alfred a quick 
     salute  and the bug is gone

     int jokers van  evening

     the joker and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of gotham park police barricades are 
     everywhere the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala horns honk in anger

                              joker

               its some kind of detour theyre
               backed up for blocks!

     the joker snorts he happens to glance into the sideview 
     mirror what he sees there curdles his blood

                              joker
               oh my god how does he do it 

     ext street  a block away  that moment

     the batman in full costumed glory galloping up the street 
     on horseback  passing stunned cops weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos gaining fast on the joker

     int van  that moment

     the joker climbing all over the driver he hits the gas 
     runs the van up on the sidewalk and  at the first 
     opening he sees  crashes through a police barricade into 
     gotham park itself

     batman is half a block behind him now as he follows hot on 
     the jokers heels two helicopters swing into the park from 
     overhead

     ext gotham park  evening

     crowds everywhere on the central platform where we saw the 
     free concert earlier an emcee mans the microphone

     he points up at the two approaching helicopters flying 
     sidebyside in tight formation some forty feet apart

     angle on helicopters

     onlookers gasp as two trapezes drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters dangling from the trapezes are the flying 
     graysons  a husbandandwife aerialist team in spangled 
     redandgreen suits they begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters

     ext gotham park  ground level

     panic down below as the jokers van barrels through the 
     crowd horn blaring batman is moving up swiftly

     on each wrist hes wearing a miniature rocket launcher he 
     lets fly with two salvos the first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree the second hits the rear door of the van  
     driving it off the access road down into the brush where 
     it nearly topples over sideways

     grayson has just completed a double somersault in midair

     got a perfect birdseye view of the batmanjoker chase

                              pilot
               ready to go dick

                              dick
               whats all the ruckus down there

     ext park  ground level  that moment

     the van bounces over rocks and bushes narrowly avoiding 
     trees with batman in hot pursuit

     int van  that moment

     at the foot of a hill the joker spies a truck on its 
     side in bright red letters a warning danger  
     fireworks flammable load

     the joker reaches into the back for a highway flare

                              joker
               head for the truck!

     int helicopter  that moment

     hovering over the chase scene dick catches sight of the 
     joker he gasps in shock as a lit flare flies from the back 
     of the van directly into the fireworks truck

     ext park  ground level  a moment later

     the batman is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive explosion all at once the sky is full of 
     bursting incandescent colors!!

     the joker hangs out of the rear of the van looking up an 
     expression of pure delight on his face

                              joker
               i love fireworks!

     angle on helicopters

     lurching and spinning in the sky as fireworks rocket past 
     one of them takes a dead hit on the rotor john grayson 
     falls to his death instantly a moment later the copter 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding fiery crash

     mary grayson hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control onlookers scream in terror

     ext street  that moment

     the jokers van bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide cordonedoff avenue overhead the second copter 
     veers wildly out of the park now swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue

     int helicopter  that moment

     dick grayson at the mouth of the bay hanging on by a 
     canvas strap he watches helplessly as his mother swings 
     into a power line and drops three stories to the pavement

                              dick
               no! noooooooo!!!!

     his face is contorted with rage and pain the pilot 
     struggles desperately to right the copter barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building and then  before 
     the pilot can make a move to stop him  dick has jumped 
     out of the copter

     angle on dick

     with astonishing physical grace he dives grabs a 
     flagpole executes a perfect somersault flips onto a 
     nearby fire escape vaults to the next fire escape down 
     and leaps out over the street 

      making a perfect twopoint landing on his intended 
     target the roof of the jokers van!!

     int van  that moment

     the joker hears a thunk overhead he casually lifts his gun 
     and blows a hole through the roof of the van

     ext roof of van  moving  that moment

     the blast just misses dick he sprawls flat yanks at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van and breaks off 
     a fourfoot shaft of metal

     another shot through the roof dick rolls forward hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield

     int van  that moment

     splintered glass flies everywhere as dick rams the shaft 
     through the windshield the driver dodges left and loses 
     control of the wheel

     ext roof of van  moving  that moment

     the van careens wildly toward an overpass dick rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     danger  low clearance hes about to get his head taken 
     off!

     one second before impact a blackcaped shadow swings across 
     the street and scoops dick off the roof of the van

     ext street  night

     batman and dick tumble to the pavement the van knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and stops dick is already on his feet 
     ready to charge the van when batman throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist

                              dick
               let me go! let me 

     the joker steps casually out of the van two goons with 
     machine guns emerge behind him pedestrians scream as the 
     goons level their guns at the crowd

                              dick cont
               you piece of  you motherf

     dick is kicking screaming clawing biting batman has his 
     hands full restraining the kid

                              joker
               like your boyfriend hes kinda
               hot
                     glowering at batman
               hands off the belt

                              batman
               take me let the boy go

                              joker
               gosh i could kill you but then
               youd miss my party and id be
               real real sad if you couldnt make
               it

                              batman
               what are you talking about

                              joker
               batman! dont you even recognize
               your old pal jack after all 
                     cackling insanely
               you made me what i am today

     batman cocks his head in puzzlement as distant sirens 
     blare the joker and his hoods  guns still aimed at the 
     crowd  back away and race off on foot vanishing into the 
     night

     dick breaks free and bolts after them batman throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle the boy is hysterical

                              dick
               he killed my parents! he killed
               my 

     batman flinches at the sound of the words he reaches into 
     his belt and  mercifully  breaks a knockout capsule 
     under dicks nose

                                                 dissolve to

     insert  television screen

     a taped report from the hallway outside alicias apartment 
     cops and forensics men mill about in the bg

                              reporter
                on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious batman the apartment was
               boobytrapped with the jokers
               laughing gas leaving 17 policemen
               dead

               also found dead at the scene was
               alicia hunt 26 a former model 

     camera pulls back to reveal that the tv screen is part of 
     bruces bank of monitors deep in the batcave the other 
     screens show the various rooms of wayne manor all empty

     we move now to the video display of a computer workstation 
     showing two faces sidebyside a mug shot of jack napier 
     and a freezeframe of the joker from one of his pirate 
     transmissions a graphics program abstracts the twin heads 
     into threedimensional rotating topological grids  and 
     as we watch the two spinning heads collide and merge
     except for the fearsome grin they mesh perfectly

     yet another terminal bruces database the same phrase
     flashes again and again scrolling up the screen ace 
     chemical co ace chemical co ace chemical co

     and finally bruce himself slumped at a table his head 
     in his hands hes realized to his horror that he is
     responsible for the birth of the joker and frankly
     he would just as soon be dead

     int wayne manor  guest bedroom  day

     dick grayson is sprawled on a huge fourposter bed 
     unconscious softly moaning he comes to with a jolt

     breaking into a sweat almost instantly he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings a shadowy figure stands nearby

                              dick
                where am i

               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want

     bruce steps out just as alfred enters with a breakfast 
     tray dick makes a puzzled face what the hell is going on 
     here

     int hall of justice  day

     beneath the statue of blind justice bruce and harvey dent 
     march through the portico engaged in a heated argument

                              dent

                              bruce
               do you still think the joker cares
               about money

               dont have access to all your

     mexican standoff bruce stalks off fuming dent hangs back 
     a moment then turns down the hall

     ext wayne manor  establishing  day

     the ornate wroughtiron gate which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward wayne manor its bolted shut

     int wayne manor  day

     a glassenclosed room which houses an enormous heated 
     indoor swimming pool dick grayson does a couple of laps 
     then climbs out and towels himself off

     he looks out at the estate tennis courts a riding stable 
     in the distance hes not happy all this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order

     int guest bedroom  day

     an open suitcase on the bed dick fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of winged victory  then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnasts 
     costume when he looks up he sees bruce in the doorway 
     behind him

                              dick
                your butler wouldnt gimme a ride
               so i figured id hoof it

               same thing again youll go after
               the joker and youll wind up dead
                     turning to go

                              dick
               hey man look at you youre
               rich you got everything you want
               how do you know whats in my mind

     bruce turns to face him the little hellions eyes are 
     filled with raw burning hatred bruce knows the feeling

                              bruce
               i dont care whats in your mind
               youre staying

     bruce reaches for a key in his pocket without warning the 
     kid rushes him throwing a rocksolid punch with blinding 
     speed bruce sidesteps him parries the blow and winds up 
     spinning dick around  into a wall

     dick is stunned but he has to laugh this rich boy has a 
     move or two bruce stands there silently challenging him

     a second later the kid is airborne  upping the ante with 
     a scissorkick aimed squarely at bruces gut in a blur of 
     motion bruce checks the kick swings an arm into dicks 
     chest and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back

     int wayne manor  kitchen  that moment

     alfred in his apron fixing a tray of snacks he looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling from the sound of it a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom

     int guest bedroom  that moment

     dicks body  head down feet up  flies through the air 
     he smashes into a closet door and slumps to the carpet 
     shaken now and sweating profusely he looks up at bruce 
     who stands calmly over him adjusting his necktie

     a long tense moment passes between them then

                              dick
                youre him

     no reply from bruce their gazes lock and suddenly 

                              alfred vo
               freeze!

     dick and bruce look around the puny mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway feet spread in a dirty harry stance 
     a 44 magnum trained on dick

                              bruce
               its all right alfred everythings

     int conference room  afternoon

     canned applause as the joker marches out onto a makeshift 
     stage to give his quarterly report to the stockholders

     familiar faces all around  the major players of the 
     gotham underworld but despite the enormous twisted grins 
     no one here is laughing or applauding no one here is
     living the joker is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses

     one of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop

     int batcave  evening

     tight on a tiny electronic device two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together topped by a digital timer 
     bruce makes a few adjustments with a jewelers screwdriver 
     hits a trigger and watches the timer tick off seconds 30 
     29 28 at 25 seconds bruce kills the
     countdown and clamps the device into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt

     he stands up wearily hes in his batsuit minus the cape 
     and cowl behind him hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows is his loyal butler alfred

                              bruce
               wheres the boy

                              alfred
               upstairs hes quite docile

                              bruce
               i know that feeling it wont last

     bruce takes a moment to survey the batcave as alfred looks 
     on tremulously

                              bruce cont
               hes a long way ahead of where i was
               at his age
                     taking alfreds
                      shoulders
               i want you to treat him just as if
               he were me promise

                              alfred

               beyond that you know what to do
               dont let all this go to waste

     their eyes lock for a long moment alfred is unable to 
     speak finally bruce turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the batcave to wayne 
     manor on the third step he pauses

                              bruce cont
               alfred  thank you

     as bruce disappears up the stairs a shaken alfred steadies 
     himself against a lab table fighting back tears

     int bruces bedroom  evening

     bruce draws the curtains sets an alarm clock the current 
     time is 709 pm

     he sits crosslegged on the floor slumps forward slightly 
     and closes his eyes he inhales exhales taking deep 
     regular breaths his muscles relax ten seconds later 
     bruce has plunged into deep sleep

     time passes the clock shows 719 732

     at 744 we track in on bruces unconscious face drawing 
     closer and closer until his eyelids fill the frame

     the batmobile stops short of the main gate engines roar 
     and the supercar accelerates smashing through the gate and 
     taking half the chainlink fence with it

     in the guards booth armed goons pull guns as the 
     batmobile streaks across the parking lot and launches a 
     rocket at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor a thunderous explosion tears a gaping hole 
     in the door

     the batmobile cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     skids to a halt on the refinery floor the jokers men are 
     everywhere they take one look at the batmobile panic and 
     pelt the car with a barrage of machinegun fire

     stationed all up and down gothams widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable searchlights  mounted on trucks with
     portable generators unaffected by the power outage

     on the moneycovered sidewalks total bedlam but on the 
     street itself a bizarre parade is taking place just as if 
     nothings wrong rumbling up the avenue at twoblock  
     intervals moored to floats are dozens of enormous 
     balloons in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures its like a hellish thanksgivings day procession

     the leadoff balloon is a gigantic grotesque clown  
     smiling ghoulishly dressed in white pierrot frills we 
     tilt down to the float beneath it 

      and there atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be sits the joker  smiling waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal

     the three cargo trucks from ace chemical roll ominously 
     toward the reservoir on their deadly mission and then  a 
     streaking black shadow enters frame overtaking the trucks

     the batwing! a phenomenal ultralight aircraft swift 
     sleek jetblack and infinitely maneuverable it soars 
     easily past the trucks swooping low just long enough to 
     release a bomb over a concrete bridge

     ext access road  a moment later

     the bridge explodes blocking the trucks path to the 
     reservoir puzzled drivers climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next

     they spot the batwing in the distance  banking doing a 
     sharp 180 for a moment they gape in disbelief then they 
     head for the trees as the batwing dives directly at the 
     trucks firing three armorpiercing shells and 
     destroying the jokers lethal cargo once and for all

     before vicki can speak knox has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and raced out onto the street he 
     flings the tire iron through a glass storefront

     its a costume shop in the window mannequins dressed in 
     party costumes frankenstein ronald reagan and that 
     current popular sensation the batman

     as vicki catches up with him knox drags the batman dummy 
     out of the store window rips off its black cape and 
     dashes maniacally up the sidewalk

     waving the cape he vaults onto the back of a spotlight 
     truck vickis face goes slack now she gets it

                              knox
               gimme a hand up here!

     vicki climbs aboard they drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly  tilting the spotlight  aiming the beam 

      directly at the jokers white clown balloon!!!

     int batwing  that moment

     batman stares at the clown balloon dead ahead on its 
     massive distended belly a burning yellow oval and in 
     the center of the oval the black silhouette of a bat

     batmans mouth drops open he understands

     ext avenue  on jokers float  that moment

     the joker reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     miniature gas masks like party favors to his cronies on 
     the float then he pulls out a radiooperated remote 
     control device and points it up at the clown balloon

     he hits a button the clown begins to inflate its joints 
     bulge its face swells up as the compressor tank concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents the joker is 
     beaming a look of pure unalloyed joy on his face 

      when his parade float blows to smithereens beneath him! 
     the joker and his men cartwheel through the air and tumble 
     to the asphalt as the batwing whips past overhead soaring 
     through the stone canyons of gotham at a 90degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              joker
               no nooooo!!!

     as it rises rises swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night the tallest buildings are far below it 
     now finally it bursts  and the deadly gas inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind

     ext avenue  that moment

     the joker on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device at last he finds 
     it aims it up at the other balloons in the procession 
     hits a button repeatedly 

      and howls in frustration nothings happening the 
     damned thing is broken he heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique

     a screaming comes across the sky as the batwing swings back 
     for another pass buzzing the joker at an altitude of 
     twenty feet sizzling laser fire sweeps the street

     cables snap and balloons drift upward as batmans lasers 
     sever their moorings the joker can only look on 
     helplessly in stunned disbelief

     as hes watching his plans evaporate his eyes fall on 
     the makeshift batsignal

     past the parade they reach the last of the floats  the 
     one bringing up the rear  then climb aboard and disappear 
     through a concealed hatch

     wood splinters as the top of the float begins to rotate 
     mysteriously the muzzle of a cannon breaks through the 
     parade decorations and one moment later 

     a rosecovered tank is rumbling up broad avenue!

     int batwing  that moment

     batman sweeps past overhead he sees the tank unleashes a 
     burst of laser fire it bounces harmlessly off the tank 
     leaves a trail of smoking asphalt on the street he swoops 
     low overhead hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks over the tank and into firing range

     int tank  that moment

     the joker and his men clap hands to their ears as an ear
     splitting ultrasonic shriek reverberates in the tank the 
     joker screams out commands to no avail no one can hear
     him he falls on the controls begins hitting buttons

     through the night narrowly missing the batwing and 
     blowing a hole in the side of a skyscraper

     stabilizes the plane climbs for the clouds when hes 
     clear of the buildings he grits his teeth and rolls out

     speed on a suicide mission missiles streak past on either 
     side machine gun fire peppers the dome of the cockpit the 
     rear stabilizer wing takes a direct hit and bursts into 
     flame!

     the batwing trailing thick black smoke bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane bomb bays open as batman dumps 
     the last of his high explosives directly into the path of 
     the tank the batwing takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and crashes to the street

     and suddenly a gaping chasm opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off  and broad avenue begins to split wide 
     open!

     int subway tunnel  that moment

     broken concrete slabs rain down on a subway car stalled in 
     the tunnel directly beneath broad avenue support girders 
     groan and give way as the street itself collapses  and 
     the front end of the tank drops through crushing the 
     subway train beneath it!

     the rear end of the tank projects out through the rubble a 
     hatch pops open the joker crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street

     hes down to his last three goons he points to the 
     batwing bent broken wedged on its side in the asphalt 
     seam running up broad avenue  half in half out of the 
     tunnel

                              joker
               you do him im outta here

     the goons look on in dismay as the joker scurries off they 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     batwing through the cockpit dome they can see batman 
     inert in his harness beaten to a pulp all but dead

     a jet of flame drives them back momentarily they reach for 
     their guns move in warily 

                              voice

     the frightened goons turn in unison an abrupt flurry of 
     motion  feet and fists flying  quick flashes of red and 
     green 

      and three goons lie paralyzed on the street the only 
     one left standing is a fifteenyearold boy garbed in a 
     redandgreen aerialists uniform dick grayson

     batman slumps at the controls beneath him asphalt shifts 
     and buckles the batwing lurches to the right drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit shatters like an eggshell

     tongues of fire lick at his face hes helpless pinned in 
     place he manages to look up  and sees through a dream
     like haze a hand extended toward him

                              dick
               hey! come on!

     and suddenly dick is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage he gets an arm around batmans chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort hauls him out of the batwing

     ext street  a moment later  night

     they stagger across the ruptured street batman grimaces in

                hes mine now

     dick snatches an abandoned 38 off the pavement

                              batman
               dick!

     the batman tries to pull himself erect the pain is 
     unendurable his body has finally failed him

     he collapses on the pavement powerless to intervene as 
     dick races off with murder in his eyes

     ext gotham cathedral  night

     a belltowers jagged spire jutting up into the night sky 
     piercing the moon down at street level the joker is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral he pulls a walkietalkie off his belt

                              joker
               gotham cathedral come and get me

     heavy paneled doors groan on tired hinges as the joker 
     forces his way inside a beat then dick grayson appears 
     hot on his trail sprinting up the steps two at a time

     int cathedral  a moment later  night

     ancient and creepy a huge pipe organ shattered stained
     glass windows row after row of mahogany pews all 
     forgotten covered with dust and cobwebs the joker wanders 
     about staring at the statuary the rusted icons

     dick enters silently behind him he kneels behind a rear 
     pew brings up the gun and squeezes off three quick shots 
     at the joker the joker dives takes cover and returns 
     dicks fire then silence

     in a crouch groping his way along the wall the joker 
     finds what he wants a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway leading to the belltower he ducks inside and 
     starts up

     dicks gun drops with a thud his hand slips from the back 
     of the pew in the second before he slumps to the floor 
     unconscious he sees a curious sight a tiny black ninja 
     wheel imbedded in the flesh of his leg

     behind him  framed in the arched doorway  a ragged 
     black ghost begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral

     int cathedral  belltower  night

     a tiny stone chamber 8x8 open on four sides to the 
     wind the enormous church bell has long since been removed

     the joker stands in an archway gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below he hits a button on the walkietalkie

                              joker
               im in the belltower dont land

     int helicopter  moving  night

     a pilot replies through his radio headset

                              pilot
               eta two minutes hang on

     the pilot swings the copter right in a wide swooping arc

     int stairway to belltower  that moment  night

     batman broken beaten his right leg useless he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time he should be dead
     dried blood cakes his face his chest

     dizzy exhausted his body strained to the limit he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller  and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry swollen tongue

     quaking all over he tries to draw himself erect and 
     topples over landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs

     the stairway collapses turning to splinters beneath him 
     and suddenly batman finds himself dangling precariously in 
     midair hanging by one hand to an upper step

     it would be so much easier to let go he looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway still falling 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell

     then he looks up at the trapdoor a mere six feet away 
     his teeth clench in a monstrous grimace and with an 
     inhuman effort he hoists himself up onto the upper steps

     for a full five seconds hes blind with pain a ragged 
     wooden shaft is buried in his right shoulder twitching 
     trembling he reaches up and yanks it out with his last 
     ounce of strength

     the trapdoor is a foot above his head it could be a mile 
     batman finally realizes hes not going to make it

     he reaches down and rips open a velcro seal on his utility 
     belt revealing the strange timer device we saw him making 
     earlier before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side

     the batman is out like a light

     int belltower  that moment  night

     the joker glances casually down at the trapdoor wondering 
     what all the noise is about he draws his gun moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor and lifts it a few inches 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs

                              joker
                batman

     no reply the joker stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker he looks out through the archway sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter then  a look of curious amusement on 
     his face  he steps down through the trapdoor and lugs 
     batman up into the belltower

     he props batman up against a wall still no sign of life 
     the joker crouches beside him and  almost tenderly  
     pats his face

                              joker cont
               batman batman

     the batmans lips part but hes too weak to speak

               before i kill you id like to see
               who you are would that be okay

     batman emits a tiny low moan the joker takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl

     bruce wayne stares up with dulled sightless eyes the 
     joker reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief 
     moistens it dabs at the caked blood on bruces face

                              joker cont
               oh my arent we pretty
                     brightening suddenly

     the joker is enormously tickled by this discovery he claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee

               mad man 

                              joker

               bruce were both murderers think
               how many people youve killed by
               letting me live

     a spotlight cuts through the night sky the joker hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance

     bruce reaches down furtively finds the timer on his 
     utility belt flicks a switch and the countdown begins

     the joker pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly

                              joker cont
               i have to do it now bruce but it
               wont even hurt now relax the
               bats in his belfry alls right
               with the world 

     he has the razor almost up to bruces throat when bruce 
     reaches out and grabs his lapels in a death grip the joker 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection

                              joker cont
               why bruce 

     then he hears ticking

     looks down at the flashing digital display on bruces belt 
     026 seconds 025 seconds

     he shrieks horrifically and drops the razor

     bruce wont let go of him finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away sprawling on the floor of the belfry

     bruce is wearing a great big joker smile

                              joker cont
               its not funny!!!

                              bruce
               no sense of humor

     the joker reaches out for the ticking time bomb thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand

     he can see the copter approaching now slicing through the 
     clouds he screams waves a flashlight in the air his 
     signal beacon 020 and counting

     the joker scans the belltower frantically his eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor he races over flings it open starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy

     there are no stairs theyve collapsed 016 and 
     counting

     screaming insanely the joker vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway the copter is directly 
     overhead now a rope ladder drops from its belly

     ext belltower  that moment

     the helicopter descends its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral dead 
     leaves rise and swirl in the churning air

     int belltower

     the joker makes a futile grab at the rope ladder almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet he gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass 012 to go

     ext belltower

     a maelstrom of swirling leaves and now among the leaves 
      roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral 

      a horde of squealing chittering bats!! filling the air 
     like a black cloud hundreds of them taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury 

     int belltower

     the joker leaps into empty space grabs hold of the ladder 
     cackles in mad triumph 

      and suddenly the belltower is full of bats a screeching 
     swarm hideous blackwinged  swooping through the 
     archways directly at the joker 

      who screams in terror  lets go of the ladder 

      and plunges into the night

     tight on batman six seconds remain there is still time if 
     he makes his choice now

     surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings his body 
     working on pure adrenalin he unbuckles the belt lurches 
     into position heaves it out into the darkness

     it snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder

     int helicopter  pov copilot

     the copilot is hanging out one side of the copter just 
     enough to see whats going on

                              copilot
               pull up!! pull 

     ext churchyard  overhead angle

     its as if time has stopped the world has grown suddenly 
     silent were looking down at the joker whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard slowly elegantly  we have all the time in 
     the world now  we drift downward closer until his face 
     fills the screen the familiar chilling grin still intact

     sad clown aone crazy boy staring aimlessly at the stars 
     suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline glow

     pov joker

     looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks 
     bursting and burning spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence

     reverse angle  the jokers face

     its all so lovely the jokers expression is happy almost 
     childlike as he gazes up at this private show gradually 
     though the bright colors fade and the jokers face begins 
     to relax the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in

                                               fade through to

               all of me

     a hard question for vicki to answer she thinks it over for

     int batcave  that moment  day

     dick grayson stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the gymnasts rings suspended overhead he sets 
     his jaw and then  with only a moments hesitation  
     leaps into the void

     his hands find the rings he launches himself high into the 
     air and does a spectacular triple somersault catching the 
     rings on his way down

     exhilarated he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit 10point0 a smile of pleasure comes to his lips

     ext rooftop  gotham city  night

     a dark moonless night lights of the city sparkle in the 
     distance camera drifts across the rooftop settling 
     finally on the broad back of a blackcaped figure poised at 
     the edge of the roof gazing down on the streets below

     a second figure enters frame we get a brief glimpse of his 
     redandgreen suit in the seconds before our eyes turn 
     skyward to the searing yellow spotlight sweeping through 
     the clouds in its center the vast black silhouette of a 
     bat wings extended dominating the night sky

     we hold on the glaring batsignal as batman and robin 
     vanish over the edge of the roof plunging down toward new 
     adventures music builds and we

                                                 fade out
