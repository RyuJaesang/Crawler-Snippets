blow is so devastating it knocks mikeys feet out from
under him so that he topples faceforward into storms
arms out cold storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to
the ground

storm shakes a sore hand and notices its cut kneeling
down to the outstretched heap he finds the cause of his
injury  one of mikeys teeth wiggles freely in his
fingers storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the
big guys hand

the punks dont know whether to laugh or just shoot him
but it is too late for either option as storm suddenly
spins between the punks and behind the gun

the shotgun goes off and blows away part of the back wall 
bottles explode  storm locks the punks fingers into
the gun rotates the gun as a bar breaking the punks
arm

the others make their move  but now storm has the shotgun
and is using it as a sword or staff he looks like a
true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation
these pour stupid punks have become the instruments in
his spontaneous orchestra

punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at storm with his long knife
storm ducks goes to his knees and uses the gun to foot
sweep the punk the punks legs fly skyward and his head
slams against the floor as soon as he hits the shotgun
is slammed through his teeth

the last punk has produced an icepick and is staring at
his compadres in disbelief he and storm square off

                         storm
                 to punk calmly
          i know what youre thinking    i
          have this big shotgun and all   you
          have is that little icepick    mines
          bigger than yours its not    fair

storm sets the gun down    punk #3 is still frozen

                            storm
          still not fair

storm gets down on his knees

                         storm
          dont wait for the blindfold
          maricon

                         punk #3
                 clutching the
                  ice pick tightly
          chinga tu madre!

the punk lungs thrusting the ice pick with lightning
speed at storms face

storm makes a slight movement parries the thrust and
slides his body behind the punk simultaneously slamming

          a couple of things crossed my mind
          in the car coming home

another kiss they get their glasses out of the way
storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed they begin
kissing more deeply storm helps felicia slide out of
her teddy top her beautiful breasts rise into the light
storm begins to kiss them she moans with pleasure the
lovemaking increases in intensity felicias hand groping
to open storms pants he begins to help her guiding
her legs apart

                    frightened
            what

storm lunges for his 45 on the nightstand suddenly
loud and violent crash and the bedroom door is kicked in
two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door

there is an eruption of gunfire and blinding muzzle blast
and smoke in the dim light for a moment we do not know
what has happened then


storms pov

we see one of the assassins thrown backward jacket blown
open at the shoulder

                                                switch to


assassins partners pov

we see storm hit badly at close range he takes it in
the right center mass it looks like his right arm is
torn off as his 45 is literally blown across the room
felicia is now hysterically screaming  but not for long 
as she is mortally wounded we are sure storm will
collapse and this horror will be over but storm rushes
the remaining assailant and tilting his body sideways as
he enters he avoids one more ferocious blast

the momentum of storms quick spin catches the assailant
perfectly and like a fast spinning top slammed against
another storm has the puppet by the strings he clamps
down with his left and only good hand on the assailants
right hand and uses it against the gun as a tool for
more torque spinning him around until he is at the peak
of his circle storm with all his might spins his whole
body in the opposite direction quickly using the whipping
effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailants
wrist and flip him violently

there is a loud crack and   scream as he lands on his head
and neck and then  from   the side pointblank another
ferocious shotgun blast    storm is blown into the air
and back onto the bed from   which he came

trapped between sleep and death    a spectral haunting
scene full of pathos

and hope in this silent still world she runs a physical
therapy regimen on storm and seems quite expert at this
delicate work the workouts are electronically induced
by sophisticated impulse equipment

on the shelf behind his head is a framed photo of yogi
berra with the quote it aint over till its over

head

                            andy

she finishes working out storms muscles beginning
disconnecting the contact points she stops lifts the
robe off storm so that she can see his lower body naked
underneath

                            andy
             besides  youve got so much to
             live for

as andy replaces the sheet her wristwatch alarm beeps a
reminder checking the watch she leans over and smooths
storms sheet touching him tenderly

int coma ward  close on storm  night

his hand moves! a beat  then another somethings
happening another beat and then we see him draw several
sharp intake breaths then a very deep breath suddenly
he shudders intensely 


montage  subliminal sequence

storms return to consciousness like a disjointed dream
sequence we meld optically distorted footage of scenes
into a quick sequence depicting storms journey up the
tunnel from unconsciousness and back to life

a storm emerging from the door of his house the night
of the oscars felicia smiling taking his arm 

b sonnys bedroom the night of the oscars   sonny with
the stuffed toy embracing storm 

c the masked assassins shotgun blasts detonating point
blank into storm and felicia 


int coma ward  storm

his eyes open he grimaces with pain as if even the dim
illumination of the ward blinds him his eyes keep
blinking and squeezing his tongue working for saliva 


int nurses station  andy

alone doing paperwork concentrating totally on her work


int coma ward  storm

his hand slowly rises finds his face he discovers the
electrodes pausing to determine what they are everything
a slow painful effort

glances up a light flashes on one screen she studies

over an iv unit  which shatters on the floor!

she turns and sprints from the room


int hospital corridor  tracking storms gurney  night

from them overlaps  as the doors swing shut behind them

int close on storm

doesnt need to see to recognize that sound he gropes
at once for the wall corner trying to propel his litter
back through the swinging doors and out of sight

storm strains for it his limbs maddeningly uncooperative
 stretching pawing  until  he claws far enough
to reach where the janitors mop rests against the wall


coma ward  hallway  ford

steps into the hallway peering up and down  just as
storm slides out of view the killer grabs dannys body
by the ankles to drag it back out of sight just then


andy

backs   through the double doors at the other end of the
hall   trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies
shes   carrying she and ford are momentarily in full
view   of each other  but backs turned suddenly 
ford   hears andy! he spins  gun ready

andy carefully   heads   that way  the two corpses visible
ahead and the   killer   poised to waste her but shes
concentrating   on the   overloaded tray traveling closer
 closer    until    she turns off into the medicine
room

ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight


at elevators

storm weakly awkwardly rows himself toward the elevators
with the mop handle then using his hands trying to
grasp the wall and push himself along

out toward the hall when the elevator bell dings

the killers form  just as storms doors close

storm blows huge relief looks to see what he finally

mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all hes
got  the gurney wheels around and places him right next
to the control panel storm twists onto his side and
slams a hand over the emergency stop button but the
button jams! and storms thrusting hand has pushed his
gurney even farther away! he cant reach it!

he feels the elevator about to stop at a floor  claws
at the mop as a weapon  raises it with all his feeble
strength the doors open and 

andy crashes into him!

grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch she
exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of
rice and begins to try to feed him of course he takes
the fork away and tries it himself but by now his arms
are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake
his hand trembles and he misses his mouth  getting the
rice all down his beard spilling a little too much to
ignore and at first it looks like hes going to explode
he looks up at andy who looks so sad

storm breaks out laughing and so does andy they howl
together for a while and then settle down now andy begins

on his knees in formal japanese posture with black dugi
pants and no shirt he unravels a package with oriental
characters handwritten on the outside

in one section what looks like an old wax baggie full
of chinese herbs in the other storm unfolds a pouch
containing an assortment of needles long short skinny
fat

storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder
with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks
it in deep he then twirls and adjusts it

it is apparent that he knows what hes doing we stay
close on the needles noting the amount in the package
has greatly diminished

pull up to reveal storm with at least 50 needles sticking
out of him

he is now frozen deep in meditation camera circles around

ext wooded clearing  day

storm again approaches the makiwara

this time it is almost as if no walls can contain him
nothing in his mind can represent a barrier he has a
sense of total domination before he has begun

he begins much harder and faster continues driving his
fist deeper and faster and harder until even those twelve
inches of solid oak are not enough for him

with one lightning blow the oak splinters and flies in
half storm walks away with a frightening calm  stalks
straight inside toward the gym


int armstead gym  night

storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is
now doing some strange martial aerobictype movements
he is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black
tank top and black sweat pants

camera pans over to a corner mirror and we see andy peeking
through a crack in the door she is enjoying this
immensely she seems to be fighting her feelings and
finally she puffs up her courage having made some
decision she enters

                         andy
          oh im sorry  i didnt mean to
          interrupt i ah well i was just
          passing by and 

they stare at each other in   quite a different way this
time its obvious what andy   wants and storm probably
wants the same thing but    he tries very hard to maintain
his one objective in life    to get very strong and win
the upcoming battle

he looks at this woman who now looks more beautiful than
anyone he has ever seen storm throws down the light
weights in his hands and walks up to her

he gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair
back and kisses her on the mouth she seems to explode
with passion as she falls to the floor pulling him on
top of her

they roll in passion growing stronger and stronger the
camera pans to the mirror and we see andys feet moving
in delight

                                              dissolve to


int gym  storm  later

alone sitting up  barechested glistening with sweat
from the lovemaking he glances across at his reflection
in the floortoceiling mirror


mirror  storm

seeing himself just after making love    his wedding ring


andy

appears in the doorway returning from the kitchen with a
tray and glasses she wears a robe and has that mussed
afterlovemaking glow

she takes one look at storm and her heart sinks

she crosses to him  lowers herself gracefully to kneel
beside him setting down the tray and glasses

                             storm
                    dead
          thanks

she looks at him she has a good idea whats tormenting
his mind she reaches her hand gently touches his
shoulder 

storm pulls back

                             storm
          please

he gets up backing slowly away from her  seeing the
pain in her eyes feeling his own pain in frustration
he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment 
furiously venting rage! andy flinches at the sound the
violence

                         storm
          im sorry 
                 wracked with
                  emotion
          sorry i

          because i cant love you! dont

          else but its only days for me

andy draws a sharp pained breath

                         storm
          how can i be with you  how can
          i want you and take you when 

he cant finish torn by guilt he stares at andy
suddenly his tone becomes harsh accusatory

                         storm
          you seduced me you came in here
          looking that way knowing just what
          the hell you were doing 

                         andy
                 defiant
          yeah i knew what of it i wanted
          you 

                         storm

          for me! i dont need you!

instead he kicks the tray and glasses  which smashes
into the floortoceiling mirror shattering like a bomb

futile expression of rage and frustration suddenly

          well   somebody hand me a cue

there is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of
disbelief between the boys and then boom! ford tries to
hand storm a pool cue as if storms head is a baseball
and the cue is a bat this doesnt work very well as
storm enters and simultaneously grabs fords cue using
his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the
pool table we hear fords skull crack and he goes down

almost instantly another pool cue in joness hands slashes
toward storms head this time storm has his own tool 
and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect
with his head

he again uses the power of the attackers momentum and as
soon as his cue goes down so does storms onto the back
of joness skull with so much force we hear the neck snap
at the same time the cue splinters in half! storm is
left with the jagged tip of the skinny end

dunne knowing hell never make it in time to the couch
at the rear of the room lunges at storm with a butcher
knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table
storm traps the knife and quickly guides it into dunnes
midsection with the other hand he  raises the sharpened
end of the pool stick and slams it down dunnes throat
via the windpipe!

                         storm
          thats for my wife fuck you and

                          storm
           ill give you more time than you
           and trent gave my wife

holland changes the point of his aim and fires again    as
he fires storm empties his gun straight at holland


wall behind holland

a louis xiii portrait  where a silver dollarsized group
of holes has just appeared two inches above hollands
head they are both out of ammo


storms pov

holland picks up a fireplace poker hes swinging like
maniac and we hear the sound of the poker slashing the
air

but he gets too close to storm who snatches the poker
away from him

they are like two vicious cats whirling we see holland
gasping in agony and hear the sound of bones breaking

storm then begins the search for trent he casually
strolls through the house calling as if hes playing hide
and seek with a childhood friend

                         storm
          vernon oh verrrrrnon where are
          you

storm opens closets looks in drawers under the toilet
seat and then proceeds into 


int master bedroom

                          storm
                  loud enough
                   for trent to
                   hear
          lets see  where could that bad
          boy be

from the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a
kiddie game we are not sure if storm has gone mad or
what he approaches the master closet as he continues
the taunting melody


master closet

storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks
aside  looking for something thats probably not there
trent is too smart for this shit  hes probably on a
jet to the bahamas by now

one more rack of clothes in the farthestback section
storm reaches to shove it aside when with shocking and
deafening suddenness a shotgun blast erupts pointblank
 shredding $10000 worth of suit jackets and barely
missing storms head instantly a figure leaps out storm
gently disarms him and the two men are for a moment frozen
eye to eye


storm and trent

storm seems to drift off somewhere far away and then
violently slams trent up against the wall pinning his
chest with the left hand storm takes the sawedoff
shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight
into trents mouth the barrel simply goes through the
teeth and in his mouth it appears storm has made up his
mind about what to do trents eyes bug out of his head

storm now takes trent by the hair and leads him through
the house shotgun still in his mouth

                         storm
          you know trent i want to kill you
          so bad i can barely contain myself
          but i keep thinking that death is
          far too merciful a fate for you
          and that a nice petite whitebread
          boy like you in a federal
          penitentiary 
                 pause
           let me put it this way  i doubt
          whether you could remain anal
          retentive for very long yeah i
          think thats best for you 

trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about
to go out of his mind about this time in their journey
through the house storm has stopped before hollands
mangled and lifeless body if you think trent was scared
before you should see him now

storm curiously turns his back on trent for a moment to
pick up handcuffs off the floor trent sees his last
chance

trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty babe ruth
impression just as storm stands up the poker comes
flying it looks like storm is dead but somehow he steps
inside the arc and does shihonage which disarms trent
and flips him backwards headfirst into the fire

trents neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron
arrows of the fireplace he is stuck  struggling to
free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire 
a fate somewhat worse than prison

storm turns away 

                                                fade out

ext cemetery  long shot  day

we are not sure where we are yet in   the distance we
see a procession of marching men all  wearing kilts and
all the accoutrements of traditional  scottish garb in
the front several paces ahead of the  neatly marching
lines of men is a single bagpiper   behind all of them
is a hearse being nobly escorted by  mounted police


full shot

now we see them fully the colors the feeling the emotion
of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen
comrade

camera pans over to reveal a section of mourners  mostly
police but with some civilians the camera moves closer
and pans to the front row where we see storm in full
police regalia a medal of valor around his neck andy
and sonny are standing near at sober attention

the procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to
play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a
section of lawn the pallbearers remove the flag from
the casket and present it to the chief of police who now
slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly
in front of sonny storm he presents the flag and salutes
sonny the lone bagpiper stops and an officer on trumpet
begins playing taps the coffin is slowly lowered


full screen  tv monitor

finally the film that storm shot that night seven years
ago on the wharf spliced with the audiotape  with
subtitles including each speakers name to make every
word and identity clear we see

the two shadow men step from the station wagon the
pushed film clearly reveals them to be trent and holland
we see them conspire with calabrese and vitale

                           calabrese vo
            murder is a serious business my
            friend and an expensive one

           of natural cause

our shot starts to widen revealing that the tv monitor
is in a news studio the nightly news is being broadcast
what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out
over the air

as the shot widens and traverses we begin to see the
actual news set  including esposito who got his well
deserved scoop  and other anchorpeople crewmen etc

                          calabrese vo

           obituaries

continue move as the wharf scene keeps playing the tv
monitor passes out of frame sound goes down were moving
past the news set and its occupants who are readying to
go back oncamera as soon as the wharf tape ends and on
up toward 


lights above news set

which now fill the frame  bright and blinding the
screen starts to bleach out  it goes white and


match cut  sun marina del rey

above a perfect peaceful sea a small powerboat the
kind that you rent from the dock moves into frame storm
steers it standing up andy and sonny in the back cockpit
seat


in andys lap  portable tv

she switches a channel up comes the same footage we just
saw on the news set

it takes a beat before she realizes what it is then

                          andy
           hey  seven year storm!
                  indicates tv
           i told you youd be famous

storm takes a step so he can see the screen   views it
for a short beat then 


storm

picks the tv up from andys lap and while its still
playing heaves it over the side and into the drink!


ocean surface  tv

splashes  bobs for a few moments then sinks beneath
the surface

                           andy
                   laughing
           hey!   whyd you do that


storm

watching the last ripples from the sinking set a moment
between him and himself  when the past is allowed to
slip away sink out of sight making way for the future

storm turns back from the water surface to his son and
to the woman he loves he sits letting the boat drift
wherever it wants to and tugs andy down beside him

then he reaches across to his son pulls the boy to him
with a playful headlock

for a moment both andy and sonny are held in suspension
wondering what storm will do or say

finally

                          storm
                  to sonny
           knock knock

for a beat the boy is taken aback    then he breaks into
a broad smile

                           sonny
           whos there

storm glances to andy pulling her tighter to him

storm hugs his son with great affection pulling andy to
him with his other arm this is their beginning

drifts its happy way across the sunshimmering sea

                                               fade out
