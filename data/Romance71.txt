                                         prologue

               berlin

               season is march

               action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours

               picture commences at approximately 1235 in the day

               time the present

                

               exterior revolving door

               show general natural action of people going in and people 
               coming out but in it is the definite inference of people 
               arriving and people leaving the big hotel

               move inside through the revolving door  very quickly camera 
               pauses on the threshold like a human being seeing and 
               hearing

               dissolve out

               dissolve into clock it is twenty minutes to one  and 
               then moves slowly into the crowd of busy midday business 
               jumble

               camera pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the 
               steps that lead up to the restaurant in its journey it 
               passes kringelein looking up he is not pointed

               the camera then saunters  getting a slow profile movement 
               across  near senfs desk senf is very busy the camera 
               now passes  profile  the desk of senf general action 
               senf stands before his background of slots and keys we 
               proceed until we are facing the elevator

               at that moment the elevator is opening among the people who 
               emerge is suzette who moves too quickly for us to distinguish 
               who she is

               the camera pans quickly with her and in the distance we hear 
               her saying to senf

                                     suzette
                         madam grusinskaya will not want her 
                         car

               this line is only just above the general clatter of action 
               but it is pickedup sharply first by senf then by bellcaptain  
               and as the camera slowly turns around we see the boy going 
               towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance 
               saying

                                     voice
                         cancel madam grusinskayas car

               the camera now backs away from the scene into the bar a 
               section it backs to the back of the bar and proceeds  in 
               profile  behind the backs of the barmen a mixed crowd of 
               people drinking before their lunch

               we pick up the doctor leaning his head upon his hands 
               looking into space the woman next to him a noisy blonde 
               is laughing the doctor glances up at her  she glances at 
               the doctor she and the audience see the scarred side of his 
               face  the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to 
               her companion who is the baron we do not get much of a 
               chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at 
               his watch his shoulders are turning away from the camera 
               and he moves out towards the lobby

               back up a few feet and lap dissolve as you move into the 
               main aisle of busy room in restaurant great activity of 
               waiters the bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime a 
               string orchestra is playing

               among other things we pick up the smiling face of the pompous 
               maitre dhotel he has apparently just shown someone important 
               to a table

               the camera watches his face and follows him his face just 
               as camera reaches service table the pompous maitre dhotel 
               now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter

                                     maitre dhotel
                         where is that gentlemans soup

               the waiter frightened and perspiring doesnt bother to 
               argue  he tears off quickly camera following him to 
               another service table the waiter seizes bussboys arm

                                     waiter
                         wheres that soup

               boy goes off at great rate of speed camera follows him 
               into service room of kitchen boy stops at soup chefs 
               counter he is not the only waiter wanting soup at that 
               moment he pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket 
               forward

                                     boy
                         quick  come on  come on

               the soup chef used to impatient waiters makes no exception 
               of the young man he looks at him as much as to say ill 
               slap you on the mouth at the same time he is pulling over 
               a cauldron of soup

                                                                    cut to

               cauldron of soup being pulled over  it dislodges a small 
               cauldron that is near the edge we see the soup fall and 
               hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face  
               she has been scalded general steamy confusion the chef has 
               filled the plate we proceed the bussboy out half way down 
               the aisle the waiter takes it from him

               the camera follows the waiter who places the soup before mr 
               preysing preysing has been waiting with his serviette 
               carefully tucked in his collar his spoon is in his hand a 
               horrible man ready for action the soup is in front of him 
               he tastes it pushes it away frowns we feel he is going to 
               tear the place down

                                     waiter

               this same music is being played by the eastman jazz band in 
               the yellow room of the hotel

               the camera does not wait but backs down the room it is the 
               hour of the teadansant

               as the camera is backing out of the room which is in reality 
               the restaurant converted  the tall figure of the baron  
               he proceeds through the door of the restaurant 

               note question here as to whether yellow room will be the 
               restaurant converted or not in which case it will be 
               necessary to add scene of baron walking through corridor 
               upstairs  giving sense of distance

               the baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra he proceeds 
               through the lobby as if on a mission he glances at a pretty 
               woman who passes and nods good evening to the doctor who is 
               seated in his chair not far from the desk he enters

                                                                    cut to

               from the door and hands him a box of orchids already tied 
               in ribbon

                         yes baron

               the baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission he 
               leaves

                                                                    cut to

               in the lobby we pick up the baron leaving the florists with 
               small box of flowers  he crosses quickly to senfs desk

               senf is busy

               the baron is whistling gaily  tapping his fingers on the 
               flower box  he is goodnatured and patient

               as the baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly 
               as he hears the voice of pimenov who has arrived apparently 
               from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre

                                     pimenov

                         yes  but the audience

               at that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little 
               japanese with his wife they are arguing with the clerk the 
               japanese speaks in japanese to his wife

                                     clerk

                         the dining car goes along

               the baron and pimenov exchange glances as the little japanese 
               speaks volubly to his wife

                                     baron
                              sarcastically

                         madam grusinskaya you would 
                         appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby

                                     baron

               this just covers the scene

               the baron and pimenov are laughing at something one of them 
               has said which brings our attention to them again

               at that moment the doctor enters the scene

                                     doctor
                         any letters

                         nobody doctor

               the doctor turns slowly away taking out a cigarette with 
               his one hand

                                     baron
                              glancing at doctor

                                     pimenov
                              looking up from his 
                              letter  glances 
                              off at the doctor

                         yes  he always seems to be waiting 
                         for something  and nothing ever 
                         comes

                                     pimenov
                         the war dropped him here and forgot 
                         him

                                     baron
                              beams
                         yes i was in the war

               cut in flash of doctor 

               he turns as he hears the baron say this

               he pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the baron 
               then he looks off at kringelein  who is trying to get 
               rohnas attention the reception clerk  at the reception 
               desk which adjoins that of senfs

                                     kringeleins voice

                         to me  i have no time

               pan back to desk

                              engaged with a lady

               rohna sensing a scene with this strange dirty little 
               gentleman looks furtively around for the manager

                                     rohna
                         just one moment sir

               second clerk is looking straight at him

               kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and 
               proceeds

                                     kringelein

               as he finishes the doctor draws into the scene  he is 
               watching

               assistant manager enters

                                     assistant manager
                         has the gentleman a complaint

               rohna and kringelein speak together

                                     rohna
                         the gentleman is dissatisfied with 
                         room number five fiftynine

               bellboy stands watching curiously and even senf pauses and 
               looks up

               during this scene the manager has been talking with rohna 
               quietly the manager how turns

                              subdued  exhausted 
                         does that mean that the bath is my

               he takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract 
               money

                                     doctor
                         that will not be necessary

               the manager is instructing the bellboy to take kringelein to 
               the new room

               kringelein accidentally drops a bill  the baron who has 
               noticed the money stoops to pick it up

               in bending himself kringelein drops his hat

               baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his 
               sleeve

                                     kringelein

                              he is impressed

               baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly 
               popular

                              collar

               zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out

               at that moment pimenov returns from the newsstand where 
               he has bought the evening papers

                                     pimenov

               kringelein turns to the desk the doctor turns up with him

               chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth  but still 
               holds it in his hand

               she crosses to elevator

               the camera rushes up behind her almost pushing into elevator 
               with her

               as she enters the elevator and the gate shuts she turns 
               around back pressed against the baron  who is looking 
               down at her the look on her face is the look we often see 
               on flaemmchens in elevators when they are pressed

               note good introduction for flaemmchen

               the lift ascends

               upper corridor

               flaemmchen steps out of the lift she is looking around for 
               the numbers she moves out of scene

               the doctor kringelein and the bellboy with the bag move 
               straight down the hall

               pimenov is chatting volubly

                                     pimenov
                              to baron

                         theatre

               we see flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to mr 
               preysings room

                                     pimenov
                              continuing
                         i must go and dress  shell be 
                         waking up and calling for me

               he proceeds up the passage pompously humming the air of 
               his ballet

               at that moment flaemmchen who has been directed to 
               preysings door by floor clerk passes the baron and there 
               is an amusing exchange of glances between them

               flaemmchen knocking at preysings door hears a voice

                                     preysings voice
                         come in

               she opens the door

                                                                    cut to

               preysings room

               preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it he 
               stands before a long mirror rubbing himself with a towel

               he sees her through the mirror wraps the towel around him 
               very cutely for a big man and turns upon her

                                     preysing
                         what! 

                                     flaemmchen

                                     preysing
                         then you will please wait outside

               he is very much affronted

               flaemmchen who has seen many large gentlemen in the 
               altogether 

                                     flaemmchen
                              lightly
                         dont hurry  take your time

               she goes out of the room and shuts the door

                                                                    cut to

               upper corridor

               flaemmchen emerges from preysings room

               baron loitering in the hall whistling as outlined baron 
               approaches he is also whistling  the same tune that 
               flaemmchen is whistling she glances at him as he continues 
               whistling with an amusing dance step as much as to say 
               are you mad

                                     baron
                         like dancing

                                     flaemmchen
                         not with strangers

               baron glances back up the passage it is apparent that he is 
               going to make conversation here with this girl in order to 
               keep legitimately in the passage until grusinskaya comes 
               out

                                     baron
                              turning to flaemmchen
                         never

                                     flaemmchen
                         youre a fool!

                                     baron
                         yes i am rather

               he glances down the passage again his hands in his pockets

               she glances impatiently at her watch

                                     baron
                         he must be very nice

                         really

               flaemmchen laughs at him

                                     baron
                         well dance

                              slowly
                         all right well dance

               at that moment we hear kringeleins voice calling from his 
               doorway at the end of the passage

                                     kringeleins voice
                         baron  oh baron!

               the baron turns and looks off at 

               kringelein

               kringelein is in his door in the distance  radiant he 
               waves

                                     kringelein
                         if i could trouble the baron to come 
                         and see this beautiful room i have 
                         ordered champagne perhaps the 
                         baroness could join us

                                                               cut back to

               flaemmchen baron and kringelein

                                     kringelein
                         waiter oh waiter! wait a minute!
                              to baron and 
                              flaemmchen
                         we are having caviar  its expensive 
                         but that makes no difference  i 
                         see the baroness is laughing

                                     flaemmchen
                         have caviar if you like but it tastes 
                         like herring to me

               at that moment grusinskayas door opens suddenly and suzette 
               comes out into the hall

                                     suzette

                         oh!

               by this time the others are entering kringeleins room the 
               baron turns back for a moment

                                     baron
                              calling back quietly 
                              to suzette
                         asleep  ssshhh  sorry!

               suzette turns back into the room

                                                                    cut to

               grusinskayas room

               it is typical hotel halfopen trunks etc curtains are 
               drawn  room is in semidarkness there is a sense of 
               silence except for distant music coming from the yellow 
               room below

               in suzettes hands we see one of grusinskayas ballet slippers 
               which she has been mending

               she is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly 
               and looks off dramatically at

               grusinskaya

               shot from her angle she is sleeping beneath a chinese robe 
               on the chaiselounge

               apparently she has changed her position because the hand 
               which is outside the robe moves

               the camera as though it were suzette moves up towards 
               grusinskaya her eyes are closed suzette crosses to the 
               chaiselounge and is looking down

               grusinskayas eyes open suddenly she looks at the ceiling 
               and then her eyes turn and look straight at suzette

                                     suzettes voice
                              quietly and reverently  
                              almost a whisper
                         madam has slept well

                                     grusinskaya
                         no i have been awake  thinking  
                         thinking

                                     suzettes voice
                         it is time for the performance

                                     grusinskaya
                         the performance

                                     suzette
                         it is time

               like a soldier called to attention grusinskaya sits suddenly 
               upright 

                                     grusinskaya
                         always the performance  every day 
                         the performance  time for the 
                         performance
                              she pauses and droops 
                              suddenly
                         i think suzette i have never been 
                         so tired in my life
                              she takes the bottle 
                              of veronal which is 
                              nearby
                         veronal didnt even help me to sleep
                              laughs a little

                                     suzette
                              speaking into 
                              telephone
                         madam grusinskayas car is to be 
                         brought

               while she is speaking grusinskaya rises  with the grace of 
               a dancer she picks up the chinese robe that has fallen to 
               the floor and although there is only one other woman in the 
               room  she holds the robe around her

               she crosses to the mirror and looks at her face running her 
               fingers through her hair she gently massages under her eyes 
               and the camera sees grusinskaya for the first time

               there is silence in the room  neither of the women speak

               suzette gets madams clothes ready she crosses puts the 
               case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them

               grusinskaya looks into space  silence  dead silence

               suzette kneels as if to put madams stockings on for her 
               grusinskaya pulls her foot away

                                     grusinskaya
                         i cant dance tonight 

                                     suzette
                         it will pass  it will pass  come

                                     grusinskaya
                         let us cancel the engagement

                                     suzette
                         but madam cannot do that

                                     grusinskaya
                         now is the time to cancel to stop 
                         entirely i feel it  everything 
                         tells me  enough  enough

               she leans forward against the dressingtable and her hands 
               unconsciously touch the pearls

                                     grusinskaya
                              very quietly
                         the peals are cold  everything is 
                         cold  finished  it seems so far 
                         away  so threadbare  the russians  
                         st petersburg  the imperial court  
                         the grand duke sergei 
                              long pause as though 
                              she were reliving 
                              incidents of the 
                              past
                          sergei  dead  grusinskaya  
                         its all gone

               she throws the pearls away down upon the floor

                                     suzette
                         mon dieu  the pearls  if they 
                         were to break 

                                     grusinskaya
                         the pearls wont break  they hold 
                         together and bring me bad luck  
                         i hate them!

               suzette crosses replacing the pearls

                                     suzette
                         orchids come again madam  no card  
                         i think perhaps they are from the 
                         same young man  he is at the end 
                         of the corridor  tall  he walks 
                         like a soldier  madam must have 
                         noticed how often he is in the 
                         elevator with us last night for 
                         instance 

                                     grusinskaya
                         oh suzette  suzette  sshh  
                         quiet

               grusinskayas eyes are looking off into space  she is away 
               in russia  she does not look 

               telephone rings  suzette crosses to telephone

                                     suzette
                         ah oui  the car is here for madam

                                     grusinskaya
                         send it away  i shant need it

               there is a knock at the door  a certain kind of knock

                                     grusinskaya
                         come in

               she picks up the telephone and as she does so pimenov enters 
               suzette quickly gives pimenov a signal that there is trouble 
               as pimenov is closing the door we hear grusinskaya speak 
               into telephone

                                     grusinskaya
                              authoritatively
                         madam grusinskaya will not require 
                         her car  no  she will not be 
                         going to the theatre
                              she turns

               pimenov at heart a clown makes a grand comedy bow he will 
               deliberately try to tease madam out of her mood

               she glances at him without smiling crosses to the dressing
               table and sits

                                     pimenov
                         it is time for the performance

                                     grusinskaya
                              under her breath
                         the performance  the performance  
                         the performance
                              during this scene 
                              the orchids fall to 
                              the floor

               it is a hysterical outburst it is not a woman who is just 
               temperamental it is something deeper than that she is very 
               near a nervous breakdown we the audience must feel with 
               her a revulsion against the word performance

                                     pimenov
                              tenderly  as he 
                              touches her shoulder 
                              gently
                         poor little lisevata  she still 
                         has her stage frights  it will 
                         pass

               pimenov kneels by grusinskaya  he is chafing her hands he 
               attempts to soothe her

               now grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away

                                     grusinskaya
                         it is not stage fright  its 
                         something more 

                                     pimenov
                              tenderly
                         what  what is it last night

                                     grusinskaya
                         last night there was no applause

                                     pimenov
                              quickly
                         there was  there was

                                     grusinskaya

                         for those few  i was frantic  i 
                         finished  the last beat and
                              she reclines her 
                              head as the swan 
                              finishing the dance

                         meierheim 

               the door opens suddenly meierheim bursts into the room

               meierheim is pushing the bell

                                     pimenov

               they are walking towards kringeleins room they are pacing 
               rather like men who walk the deck on a liner they turn almost 
               together but when they turn back past the camera the camera 
               proceeds on into kringeleins room the camera enters the 
               room to a burst of laughter champagne bottles open caviar 
               smoke etc

               in the room are the doctor kringelein the baron flaemmchen 
               and a very fat waiter  comedian

               her head

                              champagne he touches

               through the door her manner changes she puts down her glass

                              she is moving out

               kringeleins optimism has left him for a moment he stands 
               looking out of door undecided he is drooped suddenly as 
               though years had returned to him

                         kringelein

               they move into the room

                                                                    cut to

               no scenes 24 and 25 sequence omitted from original script

               near elevator

               pimenov and meierheim are standing there

               meierheim is pushing the elevator button

               the baron stands near and pauses he is now a changed man 
               he looks off as he hears the voice of grusinskaya off in 
               the distance

               grusinskayas voice hurry suzette

               grusinskaya

               shot from the barons angle grusinskaya is sweeping down 
               the corridor followed by suzette

                                                               cut back to

                         please baron  forgive me  not 
                         now  here she is

               grusinskaya sweeps into scene

               the baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a 
               glance at her

               they look at each other he fixes his eyes on her 
               characteristically she glances at him this is the first 
               time they have met in the picture

               she is impatient as if to break an awkward silence she 
               turns to suzette

                                     grusinskaya
                         my coat

               suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls as she takes 
               the coat off her arm grusinskaya glances down at the jewel 
               case

                                     grusinskaya
                         suzette  i told you not to bring 
                         the pearls i will not wear them 
                         tonight

                                     meierheim
                         why not

                                     grusinskaya
                         take them back suzette

                                     meierheim
                         you havent time

               suzette hesitates

                                     grusinskaya
                         hurry suzette

                                     meierheim
                         such nonsense

               suzette toddles off with the pearls

               the elevator opens collects its passengers all except the 
               baron and descends

               flash in

               a shot of grusinskayas eyes as she goes down glancing up

               flash in

               a shot of the reverse of him looking down

               the baron pauses hesitates thinks we are interested in 
               his action for the first time he becomes furtive

               hotel lobby  from elevators

               music swells up from the yellow room a great deal of noise 
               confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit 
               grusinskaya followed by pimenov meierheim and some other 
               people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the 
               great grusinskaya

                                     meierheim

                         the car for madam grusinskaya

               the bellboy hears it and passes the word around it seems to 
               be echoed through the lobby

               people turn as grusinskayas spirit seems to rise with the 
               attention she is getting

               the camera precedes her through the revolving door as she 
               sweeps outside of the hotel

               the barons chauffeur schweinke is seen to watch her go 
               he looks furtively around and enters the hotel

                                   end of sequence #1

               preysings room

               zinnowitz and preysing are standing by door

                                     preysing

                                     preysing

                         i couldnt live happily otherwise

                                     zinnowitz
                         well dont get excited about it we 
                         agreed that the merger with the 
                         saxonia people must go through

                                     preysing

               zinnowitz leaves

                                      sequence #2

               fade in on blackness of preysings room

               we hear the distant voice of preysing and the keys of the 
               typewriter rattling the reason for the blackness is that 
               preysings back is flat into the camera his hands are behind 
               his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly it is an 
               odd effect we dont know quite what it is

                                     preysings voice
                         both parties have fully agreed that 
                         this merger can result only in mutual 
                         advantages

               preysing moves forward showing that we are in preysings 
               room

               the change of light shows us plainly the time lapse

               flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing preying strides 
               forward as he strides he says

                                     preysing
                         moreover

                              repeating
                         moreover 

               preysing paces the room

                                     preysing
                              repeating
                         moreover 
                              he pauses thinking 
                              picks up telephone 
                              quickly  into 
                              telephone
                         is there a telegram for me yet 
                         oh  when it does send it up

               during this flaemmchen who is tired sits back and rubs her 
               fingers that have been overworked she glances at her wrist
               watch

               preysing comes and stands behind flaemmchen

                                     preysing
                         now where was i
                              he looks over the 
                              sheet in her 
                              typewriter  
                              accidentally his arm 
                              touches her neck
                         oh  sorry
                              he puts his cigar in 
                              his mouth and walks 
                              away as he walks 
                              away
                         where was i

               as he turns he catches a down shot on her from behind as 
               she stretches back showing her busts seeing his face looking 
               down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at 
               attention

                                     flaemmchen
                         moreover

                         moreover

               it seems a silly kind of lull

                                     preysing

                         no  only occasional jobs
                              she yawns suddenly

                                     preysing
                         tired

                              as he paces the room 
                              it is obvious that 
                              he is trying to 
                              collect his thoughts

               she looks at him waits a moment and then begins 
               characteristically to change the sheet of paper

                                     flaemmchen
                         i dont see why its unusual for a

                         does her work well  seems so silly

               she tosses magazine  as if it were nothing at all over to 
               him

               he looks down at it without touching it

                                     preysing

                         with the pearls 

               the chauffeur leaves

               the moment he is gone  baron looks the door  business ad 
               lib

               crosses to window

               facade of hotel

               the baron peeps out onto balcony  it seems to be clear he 
               proceeds along and peeps into preysings room preysing is 
               apparently in the bathroom baron skips nimbly past the room

               working at thrill of pass through to grusinskayas room

               grusinskayas balcony

               baron is pretty shaken by jump

                                                                    cut to

               grusinskayas room

               darkness  light from transom and building opposite

               business of finding key and getting pearls intercut preysing 
               coming out onto his balcony bringing out with him loud 
               speaker of radio  which announces noisily as follows

                                     loud speaker
                         you are listening to the music of 
                         the eastman jazz band in the famous 
                         yellow room of the grand hotel

                                                                    cut to

               grusinskayas room

               baron starts suddenly  when he hears voice and with pearls 
               in his hand looks cautiously out of window  only to see

                                                                    cut to

               shot from his angle onto preysings balcony

               preysing seating himself upon his balcony  radio loud 
               speaker seen possibly preysing commences dinner scene 
               bullying waiter

               grusinskayas balcony

               the baron knows he is trapped if he jumps onto preysings 
               balcony preysing is the man that will cause the alarm

               quickly he moves across the room  tries the door  it is 
               locked securely he looks for skeleton key and then remembers 
               refusing it from the chauffeur he is trapped in an absurd 
               way

               as he moves back from the door he knocks the telephone off 
               of the table he watches it for a moment realizing that the 
               operator must now know that there is someone in grusinskayas 
               room

               he picks up the telephone replaces the receiver wipes finger 
               prints off with his handkerchief

               he is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring 
               suddenly the thought crosses his mind they they will want 
               to know who is in the room he lets the telephone ring 
               crosses to the door again

               above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaids 
               voice singing an absurd song

               he listens she is coming in

               the key turns in the door

               quickly he hides behind the curtains

               slowly and amusingly the chambermaid tired and dragging 
               enters the room

               he is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door 
               after all this maid should be an easy person to get around 
               we have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door

               the chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear 
               from preysings radio

               the telephone commences ringing chambermaid does not answer 
               it but continues her duties

               at last because of the noise of the telephone she picks it 
               up and speaks

                                     chambermaid
                         no  no  there is no one here
                              she replaces the 
                              receiver

               at that moment the inspectress a large stout woman appears 
               at the open door

                                     inspectress
                              to chambermaid
                         youre late what have you been 
                         doing

                                     chambermaid
                              grumbling
                         everyone  all the time says come 
                         back  come back they wont get 
                         out of their rooms

               the inspectress in a very businesslike way proceeds around 
               the room coming nearer and nearer the baron she is looking 
               at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking 
               for dust she tries the door to the next room to see if it 
               is locked

               telephone bell rings again

               inspectress picks it up quickly

                                     inspectress
                         no madame grusinskaya is not here 
                         the western theater no

               suddenly out of scene we hear the voice of suzette

               suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage

                                     suzettes voice

               suzette comes in and hurries to telephone

                                     suzette
                         hello hello mr pimenov yes

               intercut

               with the baron watching

               grusinskayas balcony

               during this action the inspectress has waven the chambermaid 
               out of the room business ad lib

               meierheim enters he has heard the word pimenov on the 
               telephone  he takes the receiver from suzette

                                     suzette

               in costume very pale very beautiful her coat over one 
               shoulder is ragging she lets it drop and moves slowly into

                                     suzette

               the other women in the room draw out leaving suzette to 
               pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor

               meierheim approaches grusinskaya

                                     meierheim

                              he stamps out

               suzette with a frightened look through the door closes it 
               on meierheims exit

               during this scene intercut shots of baron

               it is some time before grusinskaya moves she crosses to 
               door  turns the key  takes the key out of the lock and 
               throws it away from her  out upon the floor she crosses 
               slowly to the mirror regards herself silently we hear the 
               strains from preysings radio playing a light viennese waltz

               grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob

               flash of baron

               watching her

               grusinskaya

               quite suddenly  as if with resolution she begins to undress 
               then she becomes weary again

               with a garment in her hand she moves slowly toward the 
               curtain  where the baron is standing

               baron

               we see him tense himself

               grusinskaya

               she drops the garment listlessly to the floor  moves out 
               of scene

               grusinskaya

               she is in a thin robe she sits before mirror  looks 
               steadily at her face her head goes down suddenly in her 
               hands and we hear her say

                                     grusinskaya
                         the end  over  finished 

               suddenly she moves quickly across the room goes to bathroom

               baron half starts out toward door he watches  darts across 
               the room as if towards the door he hears her coming and 
               darts quickly into the half open door of the closet

               she reenters  carrying a glass of water she crosses 
               places the glass down beside the bed  her movements are 
               quick and furtive  then she crosses picks up the telephone  
               asks for the theatre

                                     grusinskaya
                         the western theatre 

               she leaves receiver down  crosses quickly to mirror  
               stands there and brushes back her hair  crosses back to 
               telephone speaks

                                     grusinskaya
                         western theatre

               she glances up at the clock

                                     grusinskaya

                         hurry

               again she puts the receiver down  picking up a pencil she 
               commences hastily to scribble a note she writes frantically 
               her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver

                                     grusinskaya
                         yes  yes im waiting

               she finishes the note  commences suddenly to speak into 
               the telephone 

                                     grusinskaya

                              she lets her hand 
                              drop with the receiver 
                              and goes on talking 
                              into the air
                         they didnt miss me  good night 
                         pimenov

               she is about to replace the receiver she sits with it in 
               her hand unreplaced

               the music has stopped the room is strangely silent behind 
               her the baron peers from the closet

               her head sinks down upon her hands

               a funny singing noise comes from the telephone she lifts 
               the receiver to her ear in a very strange voice the voice 
               of opehlia she speaks

                                     grusinskaya
                              with great humility
                         oh  im sorry yes i have 
                         finished
                              she replaces the 
                              receiver

               the foregoing scene is much better played than described it 
               is in fact ballet

               quite calmly grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table 
               she folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the 
               table or hangs it over the telephone

               she crosses to the window pulls back the curtains  the 
               baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before

               we see the baron watching he glances at the door quickly 
               no there is not time she is returning calmly she crosses 
               to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer 
               she looks at it thoughtfully her lips are trembling a little 
               she moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth

               she sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded 
               hands which contain the veronal she seems to pray

               the baron comes from the closet  now is his chance he 
               looks at the door but cant make it looks on the floor for 
               the key which grusinskaya has previously thrown there his 
               eyes fall upon the note on the telephone  he reads it

               it is a death farewell note to suzette  do not insert it

               at this moment she has finished the baron returns to his 
               hiding place she makes the sign of a cross and goes to her 
               bed

               she looks around nervously apprehensively  like a deer 
               who has heard something then reassured she places the 
               veronal on the night table beside the glass of water she is 
               quiet and deliberate she arranges the pillows under her 
               head and lies down she reaches for the bottle of veronal 
               and empties it generously in her hand she has to lean away 
               upon one elbow from the barons position in order to balance 
               herself

               the baron steps like a cat from his hiding place he goes to 
               the bedside noiselessly and stands there

               she reaches for the glassher hand stretches out for the 
               glass the baron takes her wrist suddenly

               she turns quickly looking at him the glass falls to the 
               floor with a crash and breaks as she moves the veronal 
               falls out of her hands upon the bed she struggles up to a 
               sitting position

                                     baron
                         please do not be alarmed madam

               she glances up at him she is bewildered she seems to be 
               coming out of a trance again she wants to jump from the 
               bed

                                     baron
                         careful  theres broken glass on 
                         the floor

               now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness she draws her 
               kimono tightly around her glances across the wide expanse 
               of bed we see her consider passing over that way but she 
               is now a woman again  a woman of the earth  it would be 
               a silly movement

                                     baron
                         there
                              takes a pillow from 
                              the bed throws it 
                              upon the floor over 
                              the glass steps 
                              back

               she gets up quickly and crosses putting on her robe which 
               was lying across the back of a chair

               her first movement is not one of alarm but of  shame she 
               draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the baron 
               puzzled she thinks dreamily what is this she glances 
               back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this 
               man must have watched her preparation for bed we get a sense 
               of relief with her she is trembling

               the baron has controlled his nerves perfectly he senses his 
               danger he is caught redhanded with five hundred thousand 
               marks worth of pearls in his pocket he is wondering if she 
               will ring the bell for an instant he thinks of escape he 
               could dash for the balcony he could strike her dead or 
               silence her with threats there is in the room an intoxicating 
               sense of romance and danger it should be in the scene

                                     baron
                         please do not be frightened madam

                                     grusinskaya
                              after a silence
                         what do you want here

                                     baron
                         nothing  only to be here

                                     grusinskaya
                         why do you hide in my room

                                     baron
                         but surely you must know  because 
                         i love you

                                     grusinskaya
                         because you love me  you love me

               she looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she 
               throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more 
               passionately

                                     baron
                              going over to her

                         and suddenly you were there and said 
                         that

                                     baron

                         see you sob like that

                                     grusinskaya

                         what i feel like doing at the moment

               a look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the 
               situation she rises with returning dignity and pulls her 
               robe around her  she is becoming the grusinskaya of imperial 
               russia she is the woman grand dukes have fought for she 
               sweeps across the room

                                     grusinskaya
                         so you feel like coming into a ladys 
                         room  and you come what now

                                     baron

               she gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds 
               it out to him he takes a cigarette and lights it she watches 
               him curiously she smiles as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke she crosses and sits before her looking glass 
               she brushes her hair back and powders her face she looks 
               into the mirror we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live he crosses and looks at her in the mirror he smiles

                                     grusinskaya

                         grusinskaya and what is she now 
                         just someone who has found that on

                         that is not so  you dont want to 
                         be alone
                              he looks back at the 
                              bed as if remembering 
                              the suicide

                                     grusinskaya

                                     grusinskaya
                              whispering
                         just for a minute then

               outside the distant noise of kringelein is heard 

                                     baron
                         what say it again  i didnt hear

               she whispers

                                     grusinskaya
                         you  man

               the way she says it the word goes home it hurts him she 
               has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting 
               and almost happy expression she gets up suddenly

               note the other side of the bed  not where the glass is

               she reaches with her feet for her slippers she puts one on 
               she cant find the other

               business as he gets other slipper for her

               he kisses her ankle and looks up at her she smiles down

                                     grusinskaya
                         thank you  you are gallant
                              she turns her mood 
                              has changed
                         what a sentimental scene grusinskaya 
                         weeping is a sight worth seeing it 
                         is many years since she did such a 
                         thing you frightened me  badly 
                         youre responsible for this  painful 
                         scene

               he watches her

               the sound of her own voice reassures her she is generating 
               warmth her cry has done her good she speaks quickly 
               volubly

                                     grusinskaya
                         the stage frays ones nerves the 
                         discipline  its so exacting 
                         discipline means doing what you dont 
                         want to do and take no pleasure in 
                         doing do you know what i mean have 
                         you ever experienced the weariness 
                         that comes from discipline

                                     baron
                         i  oh no i do only what i take 
                         pleasure in doing

               grusinskaya turns she is graceful again

                                     grusinskaya

                         pleasure in doing you take pleasure 
                         in coming into a womans bedroom and 
                         you come you take pleasure in a 
                         dangerous climb onto a balcony so 
                         you do it and what is your pleasure 
                         now

                                     baron
                              naive as he says 
                              frankly
                         i should like to smoke

               she rises she had expected something else his reply strikes 
               her as chivalrous and considerate she crosses to the writing 
               table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds 
               out to him he takes a cigarette and lights it she watches 
               him curiously she smiles as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke she crosses and sits before her looking glass 
               she brushes her hair back and powders her face she looks 
               into the mirror we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live he crosses and looks at her in the mirror he smiles

                                     grusinskaya
                         why do you smile

                                     baron
                         because i can see something in the 
                         mirror that you cannot my dear 
                              he pauses suddenly

                                     grusinskaya
                         what can you see

                                     baron

                                     grusinskaya
                         no

                                     baron
                         beautiful but so sad i did not know 
                         it was so dangerous to look into a 
                         womans bedroom

               suddenly he stoops takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses 
               it a long tender and sincere embrace

               her eyes close a tremor passes through her suddenly his 
               whole being is aware of her she turns rises and disengages 
               herself

                                     grusinskaya
                         i think you had better go now the 
                         key is on the floor

               he glances back he speaks suddenly with an air of command

                                     baron
                         im not going you know that im 
                         not going do you think i could 
                         leave you alone here after that 

                                     grusinskaya
                         what

                                     baron

                         stay here with you

                                     grusinskaya
                         i want to be alone

                                     baron
                         that is not the truth
                              he catches her wrists
                         you do not want to be alone  youre 
                         afraid of being alone  i know youre 
                         afraid i know you you were 
                         desperate just now if i go away 
                         youll be more desperate than ever 
                         say i am to stay with you say it
                              he almost shakes her

               her head falls slowly on his breast

                                     grusinskaya
                              whispers
                         for just a minute then
                              she pulls away 
                              crosses the room 
                              quickly to the door 
                              with almost a cry 
                              she looks around for 
                              the key to the door
                         no  oh no!

               he crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms

                                     baron
                         just for a minute grusinskaya 

               outside the distant noise of kringelein and the doctor

               front on shot of kringelein

               approaching the camera with the doctor

               they are returning from the bar and are passing grusinskayas 
               room the camera precedes them the doctor is 
               characteristically drunk he is silent tense cynical a 
               distinct contrast to kringelein whose soul is warmed for 
               the first time by alcohol

               kringeleins hat the same eccentric one is twisted upon 
               his head jauntily the carnation is in his buttonhole

               the camera backs into kringeleins room and pauses because 
               the doctor has paused at the door

                                     kringelein
                         oh but doctor isnt this wonderful 
                         to live  to live  in the grand 
                         hotel

                                     doctor
                              with a deprecating 
                              gesture
                         the grand hotel

                                     kringelein
                         oh but doctor the music  the 
                         champagne  girls when they dance  
                         all the shining ice in those big 
                         silver things  thats life 

                                     doctor
                         life!  mr kringelein you are 
                         drunk  good night
                              he leaves

                                     kringelein
                              to doctor
                         but doctor 

               but the doctor has gone

               kringelein reenters his beautiful room he crosses to the 
               mirror regards himself business ad lib

               he looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat 
               imitating the doctor he repeats

                                     kringelein
                         mr kringelein  you are drunk  
                         good night

               he puts his hat on the knob of the bed

               he takes off his coat holds it up and carefully takes the 
               carnation out of his buttonhole with the coat over his arm 
               and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass 
               and some water which he sees standing on the night table by 
               his bed

               he puts the carnation in the glass having filled it with 
               water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine 
               bottles

               his demeanor changes he immediately becomes a thing of pain

               he glances at his watch  it is long past his medicine time  
               his spirit droops  he might almost be in pain

               he picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops 
               into the glass he is about to take it he smells it a sudden 
               impulse of wellbeing surges over him he flings the medicine 
               away

               with a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song 
               that we have heard during the evening  the chambermaid 
               song  the preysing radio song  the love song he saunters 
               around the room undressing

                                                              dissolve out

               dissolve into passage

               his voice is still heard in the passage

               rows of shoes outside the doors the dozing night clerk hears 
               the voice and looks up startled

                                                              dissolve out

               dissolve into a watchman

               with his clock hears the voice

                                                              dissolve out

               dissolve into a corner of doctors room

               he is dozing in a chair with his clothes on he looks up 
               suddenly hearing the voice

                                                              dissolve out

               dissolve into preysings room

               he is snoring the distant voice disturbs him he turns in 
               his sleep

                                                              dissolve out

               dissolve into grusinskayas room

               a beautiful picture  the distant voices  shadows

                                     barons voice
                         ive never been as happy

                                     grus voice
                         what did you say

               speaks

                                     grusinskaya
                         hello  hello  meierheim yes

               during this scene the baron is touching her shoulder a 
               charming light moment she continues to speak into telephone 
               his touch probably tickles her she laughs  quickly covers 
               the receiver so that meierheim will not hear her laugh

                                     grusinskaya
                              to baron

               during this scene she is listening to meierheim she frowns 
               suddenly 

                                     grusinskaya

               alone with the telephone bell ringing grusinskaya breathes 
               deeply stretches herself she goes to the glass and looks 
               at herself  smiling happily she takes the pearls kisses 
               them drops them into the casket  picks up the telephone

                              her voice is like

               the music comes up on the dissolve into the original key 
               shot of the lobby

               senf is busy

               the barons chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk 
               business ad lib of senf he turns to the chauffeur who is 
               barring the way of an important looking alien

                                     senf
                         step back please

               chauffeur makes no effort to move against the normal busy 
               happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure he 
               does not move but glares at senf

                                     senf

                         no he did not  there is no message

               this whole scene is played in a very low key almost in a 
               whisper it is interrupted by the entrance of the doctor

                                     doctor
                              to senf

                         no doctor

               during this short scene the chauffeur saunters off

               kringelein comes to the doctor

                                     kringelein
                         oh doctor such a day  such a 
                         day!

               they move away from the scene

               kringeleins voice diminishes as the camera moves following 
               the chauffeur

               the chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop 
               and out of the door as we pass the florist shop we see the 
               back of the baron in the shot

               camera pans chauffeur out to door he has not seen the baron 
               in the florist shop the camera pans back to florist shop

               during this scene kringelein has been hovering nearby as 
               grusinskaya turns away and exits kringelein approaches the 
               baron who is standing perfectly still looking off  his 
               mind miles away

                                     kringelein
                         was the baron joking or is it really 
                         true that the baron is  in financial 
                         straits

                                     baron

                         me 

               the baron looks at him suddenly

                         win some

                                     baron
                         if we could scare up some men to 
                         play

                                     kringelein
                         we could come to my room

                                     baron
                              with enthusiasm
                         good!

               at that moment flaemmchen passes

                                     baron
                         going

                         yes 

               flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something 
               that is on her mind

               a curious little scene

               she doesnt speak she just turns suddenly through the door 
               the baron glances after her a little puzzled turns back to 
               kringelein

                                     baron
                         ready kringelein

                         ready baron

               they move off and are last in the crowd

                                                                  fade out

               kringeleins room

               possibly ten men are gathered about a green table they are 
               playing cards there are champagne bottles glasses etc 
               on the table  a great deal of smoke good atmosphere the 
               game is [] fer there is a dead silence except for the 
               monotonous words of the players

               white faced the baron has the bank

               otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach 
               the table

               kringeleins back is to us

               they are smart people not professional gamblers

               there is a tension in the room the men are gathered around 
               tightly we do not see the cards

               the following voices are heard

                                     barons voice
                         all right gentlemen

                                     voices

                                     kringeleins voice
                         yes  me

               several men glance at kringelein and the size of his stake

                                     kringelein
                         is that too much baron

                                     baron
                              glances down at his 
                              own money
                         no  not at all

                                     kringelein
                         all right then

                                     baron
                         all right then

               there is tension in the room the baron deals two cards 
               kringelein takes cards

                                     a man
                              quickly
                         dont show them

               kringelein turns it down he is like a little boy learning a 
               new game

               the baron deals himself a card

                                     kringelein
                              to baron
                         what do i do now

               the baron is serious there is enough money on the table to 
               take him to vienna

                                     a man

                              he turns the card up

               the baron rises

                                     baron
                         there you are gentlemen

                              he is counting his 
                              money

               they hand him the cards

               kringelein kisses the baron  he looks around

                                     kringelein
                         where is the baron  where are you 
                         baron

               at the side table the baron is standing  he is drinking  
               his face is white  he has lost

                                     kringelein
                              rising quickly

               kringelein has come to the baron

                              he puts bills in 
                              barons hand

               baron pours out a glass of champagne  he has been drinking 
               plenty  he hands glass to kringelein

                                     baron

               they both move back to the table where the doctor holds the 
               bank

                                     baron

                         all of that at once baron

               the baron picks cards shows them to kringelein who doesnt 
               understand

                                     baron
                         eight
                              he is triumphant

                                     doctors voice
                              rings in background
                         nine

               the baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and 
               turns to kringelein

                                     baron
                         thats it the lucks with you
                              he walks away

                                     voices
                         come along mr kringelein sit here

                                     kringelein

                         in my life

                         your bank mr kringelein

               kringelein seats himself puts his glass of champagne down 
               on the table

               doctor leaves table crosses to baron who is pouring another 
               drink

                                     doctor
                         out baron

                                     baron
                              bitterly
                         for a while  ill recover  in 
                         ten or twenty years
                              he points
                         look at that

               he has pointed and turned off because we hear kringeleins 
               voice

                                     kringeleins voice
                         ive won again baron  ive won 
                         again

               baron moves out of scene followed by doctor as baron 
               approaches table

                                     kringelein
                         baron i drink and win  i drink 
                         and win  i win and drink!
                              he is pulling money 
                              towards him counting 
                              it eagerly 
                              frantically not the 
                              movement of a miser 
                              not a greedy movement 
                              but the movement of 
                              an excited child 
                              liberated money has 
                              become so much mad 
                              paper to him

               during the foregoing scene one of the men at the table has 
               answered the ringing of the telephone bell he comes back 
               now

                                     a man
                         there are complaints in the hotel 
                         about the noise

                                     voices
                         what time is it getting late lets 
                         break it up!
                              to kringelein

                         howve you been doctor

               business ad lib general business of slow normal exit

               kringelein looks up from counting his money he has been 
               like a little boy with a christmas stocking he looks up 
               suddenly sees men are leaving 

                                     kringelein
                         oh dont go gentlemen!  stay a 
                         while

                              feet
                         be my guests!

               by this time the men are pausing by the door

                                     kringelein
                         i oughtnt to presume but i 
                              he is a little drunk
                         im so grateful to you  its been 
                         so marvelous the first time in my 
                         life i have gambled  ive danced! 
                         oh you can laugh gentlemen but 
                         its the first time in my life ive 
                         ever tasted life!

                                     a man
                              slapping him on back
                         splendid!

               there is a general feeling in the room that although this 
               man is drunk he is terribly sincere and that there is no 
               wish to embarrass themselves or him in fact there is a 
               nervous impatient movement among the men but kringelein has 
               reached an emotional pitch

                                     kringelein
                         life gentlemen is wonderful but 
                         very dangerous you must have courage 
                         for it then its wonderful you 
                         gentlemen dont know that because 
                         you are all healthy and happy but i  
                         believe me  a man must know death 
                         and not until then does a man know 
                         anything about life

                                     a man
                              sings
                         rejoice in life while yet the small 
                         lamp burns

               general noise among men some are ribald others are serious 
               two men come and shake hands with kringelein bidding him 
               goodnight

               the baron puts his hand restrainingly on kringeleins 
               shoulder

               kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard the men 
               are nearing the door

                                     a man
                              starts singing
                         its a short life and a gay one

                                     kringelein
                              seizing a glass of 
                              champagne
                         every glass high to life  the 
                         splendid dangerous mighty brief 
                         brief life  and the courage to 
                         live it
                              turns to baron
                         baron you know  ive only lived 
                         since last night  but that little 
                         while seems longer than all the time 
                         before  all the 
                              he collapses suddenly 
                              onto the floor

               business ad lib

               the doctor is there quickly the baron next

                                     man
                         drunk

                                     another man
                         poor fellow

               general normal business ad lib between the men perhaps three 
               of them help him up including the baron they carry 
               kringelein to the bed

                                     voices
                              of players mingling
                         drunk no hes ill looks ill
                              well paused over

                         hes just drunk!

                                     voices
                         certainly doctor goodnight! 
                         goodnight baron! bad luck!

                                     drunken man
                         hes not used to champagne  why 
                         does he drink it

               little comedy on exit ad lib

               intercut for relief  kringeleins face  white drawn 
               tragic

               one man perhaps remains

                                     man
                         can i help doctor

                                     doctor
                         no the baron will stay

                                     baron
                         certainly

               man leaves during this scene the baron has been carefully 
               making kringelein comfortable on the bed bolstering pillows 
               behind his head kringeleins eyes are shut tightly his 
               hands are limp

               by the business of the baron although we do not of course 
               know it this is the time that he takes the wallet from 
               kringelein and puts it in his own pocket

               we might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see 
               his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his 
               inside pocket 

               he stands looking down at kringelein

                                     doctor
                              drops kringeleins 
                              hand
                         it will be over in a minute

               kringeleins eyes flutter his voice sounds hoarsely

                                     kringelein
                         over  over so soon  it has just 
                         begun
                              he closes his eyes 
                              suddenly
                         oh the pain

                                     doctor
                         try and sleep kringelein dont be 
                         afraid

                                     kringelein
                              mutteringly
                         id like to live a little longer but  
                         im not afraid to die  im not

                                     baron
                              touching his shoulder 
                              gently
                         youll be all right kringelein
                              he moves from the 
                              bed  takes out a 
                              cigarette moves to 
                              the table he seizes 
                              his drink

                                     kringeleins voice
                              out of scene
                         my pocketbook my money in it

                                     doctors voice
                         what do you say  what

               we watch barons face he looks back over his shoulder

                                     doctors voice
                         you what  oh isnt it there

                                     kringeleins voice
                         no  but no i  baron ive lost 
                         my pocketbook

               baron turns in this scene he walks forward toward them

               the doctors hands are on kringeleins coat

                                     doctor
                         there is no pocketbook here on 
                         the floor probably
                              he glances down

                                     kringelein
                              starting up suddenly
                         more than fourteen thousand marks 
                         were in that pocketbook

                                     doctor
                              looking at baron
                         fourteen thousand marks one can 
                         travel  ones happiness might depend 
                         on fourteen thousand marks  dont 
                         you think so baron

                                     baron
                              with a shrug
                         quite possibly

               at that moment kringelein who has been staring up at the 
               ceiling his hands clenching and reclenching starts up

                                     kringelein
                         oh ive got to find it

                                     doctor
                         stay where you are

                                     kringelein
                         no  i must find it 
                              he starts talking
                         fourteen thousand two hundred marks
                              he pulls himself to 
                              the side of the bed

               the doctor goes to restrain him

                                     kringelein
                         im all right doctor theres no 
                         pain now  only you dont know what 
                         that money means to a man like me

               he is suddenly on his hands and knees crawling along the 
               floor looking for it like a little boy his drunkenness 
               his condition makes the situation tragic he actually gets 
               under the card table

               the doctor looks at the baron

               the baron only watches kringelein he follows him fascinated

                                     kringelein
                              talking at intervals 
                              as he crawls looking 
                              for money
                         you dont know because youve never 
                         lived like a dog  in a hole  and 
                         saved and scrimped my life hangs 
                         upon that money baron nobody gives 
                         you anything you have to buy 
                         everything and pay cash for it i 
                         wanted to pay for my last days with 
                         that money every hour costs money 
                         ive nothing  nothing but that 
                         pocketbook
                              he crawls along the 
                              floor on his hands 
                              and knees talking to 
                              the carpet as he 
                              looks
                         i must have it back
                              he pauses breathless  
                              like an animal along 
                              the wall  looking 
                              up at the men

               the foregoing speech is intercut with the following action 
               in which kringeleins voice is heard throughout  thus it 
               is not a long speech

               the baron watches he throws his cigarette away  he bites 
               his lip  sweat breaks out upon his forehead again he is a 
               thief when he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped 
               him now he wants this money and pity a slow growing pity 
               for this tragic dying thing is stopping him  and all the 
               time the doctor watches

               the one whole eye pierces into the barons melting 
               conscience

               twice during the speech at a spot through and during 
               rehearsal to be selected the doctors voice droning but 
               piercing says

                                     doctor
                         he must find his money baron
                              next time
                         mr kringelein should find his 
                         pocketbook baron shouldnt he

               these are two interjections

               and now kringelein lies upon the floor a troubled little 
               sack of pain his head down

               the baron turns away he bends down as though he were looking 
               for the pocketbook we see him take it from his pocket and 
               turn there is a very light almost triumphant ring in his 
               voice as he says

                                     baron
                         here  here it is heres your 
                         pocketbook kringelein

                                     kringelein
                              his head coming up
                         oh  yes  thats it  you found 
                         it  you found it for me baron

                                     baron
                              quickly
                         goodnight kringelein
                              he moves towards the 
                              door

                                     kringelein
                         no  no please  oh dont go  
                         dont go  dont leave me alone 
                         baron

                                     doctor
                         youve nothing to fear kringelein

                                     kringelein
                         no

                                     baron
                         come get up  come let me help 
                         you

               note if he is a strong actor he can pick kringelein up  
               if not he and doctor lift kringelein to bed

                                     baron
                         youre all right now  its very 
                         late  goodnight kringelein

                                     kringelein
                         oh no stay here baron  stay

               baron bites his lip it is the first and only time in the 
               play that we see a tear near  the strong man almost breaks

                                     doctors voice
                         goodnight baron

                                     baron
                         goodnight
                              his hand presses on 
                              kringeleins shoulder  
                              he exits

                                                              cut out into

               corridor

               baron shuts door and pauses in front of him is the door of 
               the woman he loves down beyond is his own empty room in 
               his pockets nothing in his closeup he makes the audience 
               feel his problem with him

               this man who has lived and whistled and love through the 
               play becomes a tragic lonely harrassed figure the baron 
               has broken his fists dig into his eyes  he brushes his 
               hair back

               over this comes with almost an impertinence a tiny whistle 
               he looks up and away down the corridor the figure of 
               flaemmchen stands there a small black bag in her hand the 
               baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically 
               he walks down the corridor

                                     baron
                         flaemmchen what are you doing here 
                         in the middle of the night

                                     flaemmchen
                         looking for my room  one sixty
                         six

                                     baron
                         you live here

                                     flaemmchen
                         for tonight
                              she points to door  
                              she looks at him a 
                              long time

                                     baron
                         oh!

                                     flaemmchen
                         yes  oh!

                                     baron
                         well  such is life flaemmchen

                                     flaemmchen
                         and baron thanks so much for 
                         everything

               they both go into their respective rooms

               here are our two gay young characters the gay fresh 
               flaemmchen and the debonair baron crucified for lack of 
               funds both trying to smile both trying to be light about 
               themselves yet each about to involve themselves tragically 
               for the want of a little money

               flaemmchens room

               flaemmchen enters her room cautiously except for one lamp 
               burning the room is in darkness and empty from the adjoining 
               door to preysings room a thin stream of light she puts 
               down her bag quickly tiptoes through the bathroom to his 
               door she peeps through

                                                                    cut to

               flash of preysings room

               from her angle

               preysing stretched on bed flat his stomach a mountain and 
               on it the magazine that he has been reading with flaemmchens 
               picture he is looking at the ceiling she knows he is awake 
               because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his 
               hand

               flash of flaemmchen

               an idea occurs to her she could possibly sneak into bed and 
               he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night

               camera follows her as she tiptoes to her room she closes 
               the door noiselessly and listens she throws off her hat and 
               takes off her coat opens her bag and takes out night dress 
               lingerie etc the lid of her bag falls suddenly she starts 
               at the noise has it awakened him she looks off

               shot at bathroom door

               the thin stream of light is filled suddenly the door of the 
               adjoining room opens and backlighted from the other room 
               the huge form of preysing appears in this odd lighting he 
               is a little more than preysing he comes forward he speaks 
               hoarsely quietly

                                     preysing
                         flaemmchen!
                              he seizes her to him

               she goes to his arms passively he rubs his face in her hair 
               she is passive  cold

                                     preysing
                              breathlessly
                         you are late ive been waiting for 
                         you  waiting

                                     flaemmchen
                         i had to arrange about the trip

                                     preysing
                         youre sweet

                                     flaemmchen
                         you think so

               he holds her again trying to kiss her she deliberately 
               avoids his kiss

                                     preysing
                              awkwardly
                         come here
                              he sits heavily on 
                              the bed sitting on 
                              her night dress

                                     flaemmchen
                         here hold up!

               preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under 
               him

               he draws her to him

                                     flaemmchen
                         oh  careful mr preysing

                                     flaemmchen
                              pulling away glad 
                              of an excuse for 
                              conversation

                                     preysing

                                     flaemmchen

                              she imitates him
                         that was the young lady who was my 
                         secretary in manchester

               preysing laughs she laughs

                                     flaemmchen
                         thats all quite proper
                              she is happy again 
                              she would rather 
                              talk than be squeezed
                         but supposing i met you when you 
                         were with your wife and i called

                         how would you like that

               there is a pause for a moment

                                     preysing
                         please flaemmchen  well leave my 
                         wife out of this

               flaemmchen yawns straight in his face

                                     flaemmchen
                         all right ill get undressed  get 
                         out

               he moves towards the windows which are open she pushes his 
               fat body out almost playfully through the doors and onto 
               the balcony

               preysing stands out on the balcony he looks down in the 
               street below then off he starts suddenly because he sees a 
               shadow over the railing of his own balcony he is puzzled 
               shadow crosses again who can be in his room he moves 
               forward and peeps through the window one side of the french 
               window is closed from his angle we see the baron furtively 
               searching the room he is now wearing an overcoat the collar 
               is turned up business ad lib he finds preysings wallet 
               he stuffs this in his overcoat pocket preysings face 
               watching him as baron turns to exit preysing surges forward 
               pulling the window after him the two men face each other

                                     preysing
                         aha!  the baron what do you want

                         shall soon see if you made a mistake
                              the baron starts to 
                              leave
                              bellowing

               the baron hands him the pocketbook without a word

                                     preysing
                         so thats how we stand baron

                                     baron

                                     preysing
                         indeed you must baron  you must 
                         humm  humm but you must go to

                                     baron
                         be quiet

                                     preysing
                         im going to call the police im 
                         going to watch you play the great 
                         baron with the police aristocrat! 
                         aristocrat!
                              he picks up the 
                              telephone

               the baron makes for the door on the other side of the room 
               pulls at the knob

                                     preysing
                         the door is locked baron

               the baron makes one dive across the room preysing grasps at 
               his coat and tears it with one hand holding the telephone 
               the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground and 
               one hand holding the baron

                                     preysing
                              into telephone
                         hello! hello! 

                                     baron
                         dont do that
                              he tries to snatch 
                              the telephone from 
                              preysing

               preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the baron 
               the action excites him

                                     preysing
                         strike me would you attack me would 
                         you attack me 

               with a terrific lunge preysing brings the telephone down 
               upon the barons head the baron sways stunned as in book 
               in his mad rage preysing hits again with the telephone

                                     preysing
                         ill strike you  ill strike you  
                         ill strike you  strike me!

               by this time the baron is a heap on the floor we see preysing 
               come out of his blind trance he even repeats again

                                     preysing
                         i strike you 
                              with telephone 
                              foolishly in his 
                              hand he looks down 
                              at what he has done

                                                                    cut to

               downstairs telephone room

               sharp sound of buzzing

               dozing night girl plugs in lazily

                                     night girl
                         yes  yes  operator  operator 
                              she listens  says 
                              to herself
                         they are having a nice little game 
                         up there with the telephone

               with nonchalance she flicks plug out again as she does so

                                                                    cut to

               preysings room

               new angle preysing is on his feet he has replaced the 
               receiver on the telephone he is putting it back slowly he 
               is terrified

               door opens behind him

               flaemmchen with a dressing gown on light filmy thing 
               crosses and looks down at the baron without a word preysing 
               seizes her

               her hand goes to her head her eyes roll for a moment we 
               think she is going to faint right on top of the baron she 
               is trying to collect her senses it cannot be true we can 
               hear nothing but the heavy breathing of preysing and the 
               traffic below

               suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident 
               it is the first time we have been conscious of it

               with a swift movement flaemmchen dashes towards the door 
               it is locked she rushes back as if to cut through her own 
               room he reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from 
               her leaving her almost naked he lunges after her she tears 
               through her own room

                                                                    cut to

               across the ice in way down east  it is flaemmchen a 
               berlin girl she pauses to try and clear her brain what 
               the hell is this  what is it the impulse naturally is to 
               scream in alarm she doesnt  flaemmchens dont she looks 
               around at the end of the passage is kringeleins room she 
               will go there we watch her run down the passage uncertainly 
               without knocking she pushes open kringeleins door

                                                                    cut to

               had just thrown a coat over him he is still in his trousers 
               and shirt

               like a ghost flaemmchen the shreds of her filmy clothes 
               hanging to her crosses

                                     flaemmchen
                              hoarse whisper

                              what seems to be a 
                              ghost

               she pulls on the light by the bed it flames up on their 
               faces

               it occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must 
               have been roughly treated by preysing he suddenly assumes a 
               strength

               fade in on

               dissolve into  exterior service entrance of hotel

               the trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs 
               of dawn which we remember after the climax of the first 
               sequence

               music cold and eerie

               general early morning bustle and activity

               from one van fruit and vegetables are being unloaded from 
               another huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and 
               in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time to 
               another man from a van backed up 

                                     baker

               waiters coming to work a noisy racket

               sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans is backed a 
               hearse

               at the moment we come upon it the men are pausing in their 
               work to glance the men take off their caps as proceeded 
               by the hotel detective and others who will be there the 
               corpse of the baron in the basket used at such time is 
               brought out and placed in the hearse which drives noisily 
               away a policeman rides with the driver on the box

               by this time the man with the bread is counting 

                                     baker

               dissolve into  exterior front of hotel

               shooting onto door  day lighting

               a man comes out and signals a black closed limousine which 
               pulls forward

               dissolve into  main hotel lobby

               early morning sense of chill and desolation some chairs 
               stand on tables a vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets

               various shops are slowly being opened the windows being 
               cleaned

               the general feeling of the beginning of another day

               the camera waits at a distance shooting from door as preysing 
               with a plain clothes man on either side of him leaves moving 
               towards the camera he is grim his hat is drawn over his

               suzette hurries down corridor by this time kringelein has 
               arrived at his door he opens it

                                                                    cut to

               into space a lovely picture morning light over her hair 
               she is dressed

                                     kringelein
                         whats the matter

                                     flaemmchen
                         oh  i was thinking  poor baron

                         perhaps he really was a burglar  
                         but they dont kill a man for that

                                     kringelein

                                     flaemmchen
