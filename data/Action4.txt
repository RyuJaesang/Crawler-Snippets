          dark out he has a rugged yet prosperouslyhandsome face and
          is in his midthirties he is struggling to get started with
          his morning jog
                         
                         
          ext ship graveyard staten island nyc  day
                         
          it is early morning a large bulk fuel oil transport truck
          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock the dock sticks into
          a backwater section of new york harbor that is filled with
          the decaying remains of halfsunken abandoned barges and tug
          boats
                         
          julian the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
          scans the horizon eventually a large fuel barge appears in
          the distance being pushed by a tug boat the barge is steered
          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck
                         
          julian gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
          hose he looks around nervously julian steps across the
          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
          the barge he hands it to the barge operator with a nod of
          the head and no words
                         
          they connect the hose and start a large generator as it
          begins to pump fuel into the truck they both scan the
          horizon again as the sun begins to come up

          abel is still jogging as the light begins to increase it is
          freezing out he is a very serious guy he is not happy that
          he is out of shape finally he stops and bends over to catch
          his breath we have run with him from the nicer part of the
          neighborhood to a rougher section as he catches his breath
          he stands up and looks around he is unsure of his feelings

          int annas dressing area
          the camera slowly moves in as anna sits in a slip at her make
          up table putting on her face for the day ahead she looks
          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor
                         
                         
          int drivers cab of a bulk oil transport truck  day
                         
          standard heating oil we set the standard is written in
          logo form on the side of the tank
                         
          the truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
          the verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of new york harbor
                         
          julian the young driver from the dock cautiously looks
          around as the traffic inches along he finally approaches the
          toll booth and pays
                         
                          julian
           good morning
                         
          julian speaks english with a wellsanded accent is it
          central american or mexican the female collector gives him a
          smile
          he heads through the booth but there is still traffic on the
          other side as the lanes merge together just as the traffic
          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
          see two guys come walking through the traffic and towards the
          cab before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps
                         
          the guy on the drivers side louis servidio is small and
          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength he
          shatters the glass side window with his elbow unlocks the
          door just as his partner thug #2 does the same thing on the
          passenger side but he is holding a gun they are not wearing
          masks its very brazen
                         
          before thug #2 even asks julian to get out of the cab louis
          servidio crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway
                         
          louis servidio pulls the door shut and they drive away with
          the truck leaving julian sitting in the middle of the road
          staring as blood starts to flow from his jaw

          they both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each
          other abel is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit
          abels wife anna was driving the car behind him she is a
          beautiful tall blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a
          streak in her eye that this is all business you would not
          want to cross this woman

          abel walks around and opens his trunk he takes out two large
          empty briefcases
                         
          he carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large
          unmarked armored van that is idling in the middle of the
          parking lot two armed guards get out of the van one is
          holding a clipboard he walks up to anna and abel he hands
          them the clipboard they look at each other one last time and
          then both sign the document
                         
          the other guard opens up the back of the truck abel hands
          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
          cash lots of cash abel and anna stand at the open back of
          the van and just watch finally he finishes and hands the now
          heavy cases to abel
                         
          abel picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
          truck he turns to anna
                         
                          anna contd

          she gives a small smile he looks at his watch they kiss
                          5
                         
                         
          abel turns and begins walking with the cases he gives a nod
          to the dispatcher who we now see is in a small gatehouse
          and he begins to open the front gate
                         
                         
          ext street outside the front gate same time
                         
          abel walks out through the gate and down the abandoned
          industrial street about 25 yards then looks to his right he
          looks down at the cases in his hands turns and stands
          looking into the neighboring site

          abel comes walking across the parking lot and sees andrew
          walsh standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot andrew
          is their longtime lawyer/righthand man and is in his mid
          fifties he is smart but tired the oversized briefcase in
          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
          that direction the large oilholding tanks loom above them
          the place is rusting and could use some work
                         
          as they wait the setting has the look and choreography of an
          illegal transaction about to go down
                          andrew walsh
           so how are we this morning
                         
                          abel
           gives a smile and nod
                         
                          andrew walsh

          they both take a look at their watches

           youve been telling me not to do
           this for a year

          gives him another slight smile they stand around in awkward
          silence finally a latemodel ford ltd station wagon pulls
          into the lot

          in their twenties two in their fifties and one in his mid
          tolate seventies they all shake each others hands then
          stand around for a beat
                         
           andrew walsh contd

          the group is now jammed around a folding table inside the
          trailer abel and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest
          of them finally the senior member of the group joseph
          mendelsohn eyes up abel and leans forward his accent is
          strong yet you can understand every word
                         
                          joseph
           so why is it you want this land
                         
                          abel
           im sorry
                          joseph
           it has been difficult for you to
           get me here no over a year
                         
                          abel
           almost two
                         
                          joseph
           there are many like it around and
           thanks to all these tests you paid
           for we now know it is as much of a
           mess below the ground as it is
           above my people have looked at
           your books i know this is a lot of
           money for you so why have you kept
           on us so just for this ugly and
           polluted little piece of the earth
                         
                          abel
           i have been looking over my fence
           at this property for a very long
           time
                         
                          joseph
           so it is just proximity
                          7
                         
                         
                          abel
           no i imagine i want it for the
           same reason you did
                         
                          joseph
           and whats that
                         
                          abel
           to grow
                          joseph
           well i am in the garment business
           so i appreciate that sentiment but
           i inherited this land from my
           uncle sadly he had no children of
           his own he was the one that let
           them build these tanks here so
           this place can do little for me
           in fact thanks to all those tests
           youve done it may be a liability
           as you know i offered to lease the
           site to you at a fair price but
           you were not interested
                         
                          abel
           no
                          joseph
           why not
                         
                          abel
           i like to own the things i use
                         
                          joseph
           i can see that
                         
          long pause
                         
                          abel
           so
                         
                          joseph
           yes this contract here your
           lawyers have fully reviewed it
                         
                          andrew walsh
           of course
                         
                          joseph
           and you have brought the money
           abel nodes yes
           so you realize you have only thirty

          he heads out towards the tanks and walks among them they
          tower seven stories above him as he walks he is cut off
          like a maze from any other visual input similar to being
          inside a richard serra sculpture finally he emerges into
          some light and as abel looks up the camera reveals his view
          its midtown manhattan in all its glory just across the east
          river from the site he stares at the city and we see the
          true depths of his ambition lock on his face he looks to his

          abel stands surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest
          looking across the ridge back at his house he is a little
          out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
          comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
          suit tie and dress shoes he takes a nice cigar out of his
          pocket lights it and has a real moment of joy he looks up
          to the tops of the trees then back at the new house he
          exhales a long deep breath then we hear a large truck come
          rumbling in the driveway he hears it his face shows that he
          knows the sound immediately

          great news

          in place his eye is black abel goes over and gives him a
          tight hug but then he ever so slightly checks himself and
          places him back down on the table

           make a living or even fight with
           their own hands and too stupid to
           think up anything else to do

           im not sure what you mean there
           were more murders and rapes in this
           city last year then there ever have
           been so if you have come to tell
           me that we have a urgent security
           issue here trust me im aware
                         
          abel cuts in he cant help himself
                          abel
           my people are at risk just driving
           around in this city just trying to
           do their jobs and i i have done
           everything you have asked of me
           its been two years since you first
           started investigating my company
           and i have spent thousands of
           dollars hiring lawyers for this and
           that to provide you with every
           piece of information your office
           has requested and i expect that
           you have been asking the same from
           my competitors so with all this
           information that you have gained
           we are just asking if you have any
           idea who has been doing this to us
                         
           ada lawrence
           i dont
                         
          this sits unanswered
                          19
                         
                         
           ada lawrence contd
           i understand your frustration and
           although everyone else seems to
           have given up and left this city
           for dead i havent and as you
           know we have been investigating
           industrywide corruption in your
           business that seems to have been
           going on for years and the simple
           fact is that the only person who
           could do anything with 8000 gallons
           of heating oil in a matter of
           minutes after stealing a truck is
           someone from within that industry
           and almost certainly someone with
           local storage capacity so youre
           right that means you all are
           stealing from each other which is
           as far as i can tell just a
           refreshing new take on what youve
           been doing to your customers and
           fellow taxpayers for the last
           fifteen years
                         
          this sits in the room for a long beat
                          abel
           first please know that we respect
           the work you are doing to try to
           help our business and the city but
           also know i have never taken
           anything i havent earned from
           anyone so when you say youve
                         
          he pulls himself back
                         
                          abel contd
           we are on the same side here
                         
           ada lawrence
           well yes and no see all that i
           can do is to try and put people
           away in the simplest and most
           economical way possible with the
           limited resources at my disposal
           it doesnt really matter to us who
           it is or how we do it as long as
           its progress
                         
                          abel
           well it makes a difference to me
                          20
                         
                         
           ada lawrence
           i know it does this city is a very
           difficult place to do business
           right now
                         
                          abel
           yes
                         
          this more conciliatory tone makes lawrence think through his
          next reply for a long beat
           ada lawrence
           you know mr morales you seem
           like a decent man and because of
           that im really not comfortable
           just sitting here with you
           pretending that the elephant
           perched on the corner of my desk
           isnt there
                         
          lawrence looks over at deputy lange whose body language says
          dont go down this road but he does
                         
           ada lawrence contd
           i cant go into specifics at this
           moment but we believe that you and
           your company have broken the law
           and that we have enough evidence to
           prove that so next week monday
           actually we will be bringing a
           case against you
                         
          this drops like a bomb abel and lawrence stare at each
          other then abel glances to the corner of the desk we see
          that a large draft copy of the case is actually sitting
          there abel looks back up
                         
           ada lawrence contd
           im sorry to do this in person
           its awkward obviously but i
           didnt want to have this happen on
           monday not having said something
           here in person today out of
           respect
                         
                          abel
           i understand
                         
          abel stands up to leave and andrew is still a little stunned
          but stands
                          21
                         
                         
                          abel contd
           you have your job to do but know
           that you are wrong and that we will
           take advantage of every opportunity
           to prove that
                         
           ada lawrence
           im sure you will
                         
          they turn to leave and lawrence has one more thought
           ada lawrence contd
           one more thing have you been

          sideline together although they are standing a bit off to
          the side from everyone else

                          peter forente
           we should probably get together to
           discuss this and go over some of
           the preventative measures that
           weve been taking we havent had
           an incident since november it
           doesnt do any of us any good to
           have this kind of attention brought
           to us
                         
          they both stare out at the court for beat
           peter forente contd

           your new trucks the other day

           the hitler youth i havent seen a
           teamster that blond and blueeyed
           since i was a kid

          int garage of the new house  day
                         
          the garage is filled with boxes abel stands in the middle of
          a few that are partially unpacked he has set up an old radio
          in the corner of the garage and it is playing a new york
          giants football game abel takes an object out of one of the
          boxes and looks at it with significance
                         
          coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring abels
          oldest daughter annie comes to the door of the garage

          he is making light of the situation but as she looks at
          their faces she knows there is a problem
                         
                          andrew walsh
           the da is going to bring down

                          andrew walsh
           we dont know yet
                         
                          anna
           who else

           right now they are just saying us
                         
                          abel
           where are we exposed
                         
          abel looks at his wife she looks at andrew
                         
                          anna
           we follow standard industry
           practice on every front
                         
          they all give each other a long look as this means they have
          been bending the rules in several places as do all their
          competitors
                         
                          abel
           what does that mean
                         
                          anna
           you know what that means
                         
                          andrew walsh
           it means we may have some
           accounting exposure where we have
           pushed things a little too far
                         
                          abel
           how far
                          32
                         
                         
                          andrew walsh
           you always told us to push until we
           couldnt push any further well we
           may have hit that line so we will
           handle it and move on
                         
                          abel
           anna
                         
          abel shoots her a stinging worried glance
                          anna
           i need to know what they are saying
           we did
                         
                          andrew walsh
           lets not get ahead of ourselves
           here you have always followed
           standard industry practices we
           arent even sure what this is yet
           i just wanted to make sure you had
           all the information i do this is a
           badge of honor it means we are big
           enough to give a shit about now
           dont worry
          that sits for a beat
                         
                          abel
           okay

           thank you for coming by andrew
                         
          abel reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the
          automatic garage door opener as it opens you can see the
          pride in his face as this remote is a fairly hightech new
          item they all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then
          stops in silence
                         
          andrew is now standing outside in the driveway
                         
                          andrew walsh
           very impressive
                         
                          abel
           thank you
                         
                          anna

                          andrew walsh
           and one more thing i got a call
           from the union oleary
                         
          this grabs both their attention
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           theyve been getting word back from
           our drivers
                          anna
           what word
                         
                          andrew walsh
           there is real concern about their
           safety
                         
                          abel
           who
                         
                          anna
           all of them
                         
                          andrew walsh
           the drivers are feeling
           unprotected
                          anna
           because they are
                         
                          andrew walsh
           i just think you should talk to
           them about it before it grows into
           something
                         
                          abel

          stops listens and starts growling a little more
                         
          anna looks up ever so slightly
                         
                          anna

          abel walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall
          to his kids rooms he looks in each room and the child is
          sleeping soundly with nothing out of place
                         
                         
          int kids rooms/hallway same time
                         
          as he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he
          sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down
          over the balcony into the living room the dog is starting to
          quietly growl once again
                         
          abels face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to
          total paranoia he slowly walks down the hall he stops off
          in his bedroom closet and grabs a midsize baseball bat/billy
          club now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying
          not to freak himself out
                         
                         
          int open living room/entry hall/front door  night
                         
          abel walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the
          top still growling every now and then abel comes into the
          living room and everything seems perfectly normal he then
          relaxes and turns towards the dog
                         
                          abel
           quiet its nothing come down
           here
                         
          he snaps his fingers and calls the dog the dog finally comes
          down the stairs
                         
          abel now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state but
          then the dog starts growling again and looking out the
          windows next to the front door abel comes over he opens the
          front door but the dog refuses to go out
                         
                          abel contd
           go oh come on go
                         
          abel thinks he hears something he clicks on the lights and
          pulls his bat back up into position he heads outside
                          35
                         
                         
          ext front door to abels house  night
          abel comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing
          the dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading
          over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side
          entrance it is dark the dog starts barking and going crazy
          abel slowly heads over to the covered passageway
                         
          all hell now breaks lose a burglar in all black comes
          blasting out of the shadows the dog tries to bite him as he
          goes by abel swings his club and hits burglar square on the
          shoulder but he keeps coming he knocks abel over and runs
          towards the driveway abel is up and chasing after him faster
          than we expect
                         
                         
          ext base of the ravine deep in woods continuous
                         
          there is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running
          full throttle through the very thick woods abel is keeping
          up with him and in fact may be gaining on him
                         
          abel is still in his pajamas he has a rage that has been
          building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now
          pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down
          they come to the top of a small ravine which abel seems to
          know from his runs through the woods and abel takes a bit of
          an easier/quicker path down
                         
                         
          ext woods behind abels house  continuous
                         
          abel now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his
          legs burglar trips and goes flying abel falls as he swings
          at him they both sit on the ground for a beat abel is
          exhausted they stare at each other
                         
          a brief look of panic comes across burglars face then he is
          up again and running off into the woods
                         
          abel gets himself up and chases after him
                         
                         
          ext road next to the woods  night
                         
          abel comes out of the woods into the middle of the road and
          in the distance we see burglar run up to a waiting van with
          its lights and engine on the guy gets into the passenger
          side of the van and it peels out
                         
          abel is left standing in the middle of the road barely able
          to breathe and holding the bat
                          36

          abel comes walking back towards his front door anna is
          standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next
          to her she looks at him in shock

          they both look down at his bare feet he has been in some
          kind of shock and hasnt even noticed that his bare feet are
          cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice
          his feet are bleeding all over the walkway

          anna is in warrior mode any panic in her voice has
          disappeared and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly
          seriousness she is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting
          bandages on them as they talk

          she gives him another look
                         
                          abel contd
           i think it was just some punk
           looking to rip us off
                         
                          anna

           message he could have and he
           didnt
                          37
                         
                         
                          anna
           seems like a message was sent loud
           and clear
                         
                          abel
           please dont get going on this we
           are a big new house he probably
           wanted the tv he didnt have a
           gun he had nothing the alarm will
           be in on monday it was some kid
           they arent coming back
                         
          she looks at him with considerable concern
                         
          he leans in and starts kissing her she holds still at first
          then gives in
                         
                         
          int training room at standard heating oil  next morning
                         
          abel is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his
          back showing three sales recruits what they should be looking
          for another instructor looks on we see abel in his element
          he is a salesman
                         
                          abel
           what you are looking for here is
           the opening to the burn chamber
           now at this point you have not
           tipped your hat in anyway from the
           minute you walked in the house you
           should have been working to create
           an impression of total
           impartiality but now
                         
          he reaches over and opens the small door a fire is burning
          inside on cue the instructor hands abel a crisp clean white
          handkerchief
                         
                          abel contd
           when this door opens you begin to
           close it must always be spotless
           if they see you have ever done this
           before it is over
                         
          he takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney
                         
                          abel contd
           now you do this and only this
           you look down at the cloth and
           dont say a word you just keep
           staring at the cloth and then you
           slowly just start shaking your
           head very very slowly and small
                          more
                          38
                         
                          abel contd
           dont look up at them just at the
           cloth
          then abel makes a small clicking noise
                         
                          instructor
           do you hear that noise thats
           the noise
                         
           sales student alex
           what noise
                         
                          abel
           it means you are close then
           after sitting in silence way longer
           than is comfortable you turn and
           say id love to run a few numbers
           for you is there somewhere more
           comfortable we could sit they
           will almost always take you to the
           dining room table and will offer
           you something and whatever it is
           you always take the fancy option
                         
                          instructor
           can i get you a coffee or tea
                          abel
           a tea please
                         
                          instructor
           we have some homemade lemonade or a
           soda
                         
                          abel
           id love a lemonade thank you
                         
           sales student alex
           why
                         
                          abel
           because we are never going to be
           the cheapest option so we have to
           be the best and they want no
           need to feel that you want the
           best too thats why our trucks are
           the newest or cleanest and our
           drivers are approachable
                         
          just then the woman who works behind the front desk standard
          front desk comes to the door
                         
           standard front desk
           they need you
                          39
                         
                         
                          abel
           i gotta go but the final point i
           will make is the hardest one once
           you have done the math and shown
           them what we can save them over the
           long haul through proper
           maintenance you need them to sign
           and the problem is by hiring you
           that means they are firing someone
           else and thats never easy so to
           get them over the line you need to
           close them so when you show them
           the number look up at them both
           and just stare at them
                         
          abel begins staring at the recruits he continues to stare
                         
                          abel contd
           you stare longer than you should
           because this is not a joke you
           will only keep this job if you
           close and thats not funny to you
           and i am only interested in this
           company growing and when it isnt
           i dont think its funny at all
           these people work very hard for
           their money and these other guys
           are ripping them off treating them
           poorly because they dont know
           so when you look them in the eye
           you have to believe that we are
           better and we are but you will
           never do anything as hard as
           staring a person straight in the
           eye and telling the truth
                         
          abel then does exactly that to them and he holds it for a
          long beat
                         
                          abel contd
           well it was great to meet you
           welcome and i wish you luck
                         
          abel walks out of the room and straight into
                         
                         
          int large staff meeting room  day
                         
          there is a great high/low nature to the way abel runs the
          company while he wears great suits and his trucks are
          impeccable he does not waste money so this room where the
          drivers have company meetings is very basic
                          40
                         
                         
          the room is filled with all of the drivers there is a bit
          of a nervous energy in the room it quiets as abel comes in
          he stands aside
                         
           standard front desk
           trucks 16 through 23 you should be
           ready to go
                         
          as standard front desk sees abel standing behind her she
          stops abel walks forward a few steps
                          abel
           good morning first off i picked
           up julian yesterday and he is back

           situation we are working with law
           enforcement and they seem to be
           closing in on these guys but
           sadly these are the times we are
           living in and we must rise above
           them so on that front we have
           these
          he puts one of the new radios on the dais andrew comes into
          the room behind abel and stands
                         
                          abel contd

          ext abel and annas house  day
                         
          anna is walking back from the mailbox looking through the
          days mail as she approaches the house she looks up and sees
          the two younger daughters elizabeth 6 years old and
          catherine 4 years old playing in front of the house
          catherine comes out from under a bush near the side door with
          something in her hand
                         
          anna looks back down at the mail as she gets closer to the
          house we see a look of concern come across her face the look
          then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer
          to catherine she tries to control her emotions
                         
                          anna
           catherine catherine katie!

                          catherine
           mommy
                         
          as anna comes up to catherine we now see that the little girl
          is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little
          hands anna is besides herself
                         
                          anna

           right here

          door where louis servidio was hiding and got hit the night
          before

          the little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down
                         
                          catherine

                          44

           door somebody left it there last
           night
                         
                          andrew walsh
           who
                         
                          abel
           i dont know
                         
          anna looks over to andrew letting him know her disgust
                          andrew walsh
           well
                         
          he looks around then closes the door behind him and gets
          their attention
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           its not good its bad
                         
          he takes out a folder containing the formal indictment and
          hands it to abel
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           its a fourteen count indictment
           most of it is crap piggyback
           issues but
                         
          as andrew keeps talking trucks go rumbling by behind them
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           the first three counts are where we
           start to have real issues they
           know whats going on in this
           industry they say we are rigging
           scales and underreporting income
           we dont know what they have or how
           they got it but no matter how they
           got it its a problem
                          45
                         
                         
                          abel
           that truck just went out filthy
          abel looks out the window as a truck leaves the yard
                         
                          anna
           abel!
                         
                          andrew walsh
           we are going to owe them some
           money
                         
          this brings him back
                         
                         
                         
                          abel
           how much
                         
                          andrew walsh
           that depends on a bunch of factors
           but thats an accounting question
                         
          they both look to anna
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           and there is one other thing the
           bank
                         
          this hits abel
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           we need to sit down with them
           immediately i set a dinner we
           need you both there to lay
           everything out and be totally up
           front this shouldnt be a problem
           lord knows theyve given money to
           bigger crooks than us but i dont
           want us hiding anything from them
                         
          abel does not like this joke
                         
                          abel
           you need to get home and start
           going through our set of books how
           far back are they going
                         
                          andrew walsh
           seems like all the way back to when
           you bought out annas father
                         
                          anna

                          46
                         
                         
          he looks out the window and sees a cadillac pull in
                          abel
           what is oleary doing here
                         
          abel looks to andrew
                         
                          andrew walsh
           hes been wanting to talk to you
           for days
                          abel
           under his breath
           jesus
                         
          abel gets up to go out as andrew shuffles to leave anna
                         stops him
                         
                          anna
           andrew can i talk to you for a
           minute
                         
          abel leaves and they stay
                         
                         
          ext standard heating oil yard  day

           making house calls like this
           anymore though
                         
                          abel
           i would have come to see you
                         
                          bill oleary
           thats alright youve got bigger
           things to worry about long pause
           so i cant have this situation
           with your guys continuing
                         
                          abel
           my guys
                         
                          bill oleary
           your drivers
                          47
                         
                         
                          abel
           good i would love you to help on
           this because i cant have it going
           on any longer either
                         
                          bill oleary
           so let them protect themselves
           that would stop all this very
           quickly
                          abel
           i respectfully disagree
                         
                          bill oleary
           they are picking on your men
           because they are just sitting
           there weak
                         
                          abel
           they are taking shots at me because
           i am growing expanding getting
           stronger not weaker
                         
          this frustrates bill because he knows abel is right he tries
          a new tack
                          bill oleary
           its quite simple for me i cant
           have my drivers getting hit like
           this it looks like i cant protect
           them
                         
                          abel
           well it appears that you cant

           you seem to be under pressure from
           many sides right now which i
           understand trust me i understand
           so let me think this through but
           whatever decision i make on this
           it stands those men show up every
           morning for you because i tell them
           to its important for you to
           realize that these are very
           dangerous times and we need to
           adapt its not like when we were
           driving

           sometimes the weak man is the
           stronger man if he has the right
           tools
                         
                          abel
           it may seem that way but if you
           are weak eventually it will show
           it always does and if you want
           this to all be behind us help me
           find out who is doing this you
           know a lot of people and that
           would be the most help to me

           the drivers security aside this

           significant financial effect on us

           this is what its come to walking
           around outside like fucking
           gangsters
                         
                          andrew walsh

          ext standard heating oil truck  day
          throughout this conversation abel is walking over to a
          section of the yard where workers are loading some sort of
          additive chemical to the fuel trucks
                         
                          andrew walsh
           it is looking like we must do this
                         
                          abel
           i must
                         
          this gets a little personal
                         
                          andrew walsh
           they will shut you down
                         
                          abel
           these men they work for me these
           trucks they drive the customers
           they serve they are here because
           we built this
                         
                          andrew walsh
           thats true until its not and the
           last person in the world right now
           that we need working against us is
           the president of the fucking
           teamsters this company is out of
           business in a month if he gets
           these guys to walk we are running
           out of cash
                         
                          abel
           what are you even talking about
           here
                         
                          andrew walsh
           the union provides a handgun and a
           permit to every one of the drivers
           and they think this whole thing is
           over in a week
                         
                          abel
           these men are fucking truck
           drivers this is insane you know
           who is gonna get it in the end
           here me this comes back to me
                         
                          andrew walsh
           it does either way
                         
                          abel
           im not doing it
                          56
                         
                         
                          andrew walsh
           would you put everything at risk to
           stand by that
                         
          abel thinks this through
                         
                          abel
           it will be the end of everything i
           have worked for if one of these
           guys shoots somebody its me they
           will bring down for itill talk
           to him and we need to close this
           deal we cant stay like this any
           longer we must close on that
           property we are so weak right
           now
                         
          they are now standing on top of one of the trucks tanks as a
          worker pours the additive into the tank the container says
          green dye #7 on it abel looks down as it flows in
                         
          he stands up and looks out across the fence at the container
          property
                         
                          andrew walsh
           why do you want this so badly
                          abel
           because i have my entire savings at
           risk with this deposit it is
           everything
                         
                          andrew walsh
           thats not what i mean why did you
           want it so badly in the first
           place it was a risk always
                         
          abel thinks this through
                         
                          abel
           i dont know
                         
                          andrew walsh
           you dont know have you ever
           thought about it
                         
                          abel
           ive thought about it every day for
           the last five years this place was
           sitting over that fence mocking
                         
                          andrew walsh
           i didnt mean have you ever thought
           about that place
                          more
                          57
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           i mean have you ever thought why
           you want it so badly
                          abel
           i dont know what you mean
                         
          abel looks to him in a sincere way wanting him to answer but
          andrew just waits finally
                         
                          abel contd
           i know what you are asking and
           no i never ask myself why i do
           this it just feels right
           wanting to be bigger feels better
           it feels right
                         
                          andrew walsh
           thats very simple
                         
                          abel
           yes
                         
          with this he gives him a deadly serious look
                         
                          abel contd
           it is
                          andrew walsh
           you take these risks
                         
                          abel
           only when necessary

                          arthur lewis
           so how are you
                          abel
           weve been better but we are
           good
                         
                          arthur lewis
           yes i heard about that if you
           stay in business long enough its
           bound to happen eventually
                         
                          anna
           well thats exactly right and we
           wanted to sit down with you tonight
           to make sure we were being totally
           upfront with everything that is
           going on and make sure that you
           understand the nature of the
           complaints and are comfortable that
           it is not going to affect our
           business in an adverse way
                         
                          andrew walsh
           did you have a chance to look over
           the outline that i sent over
                         
                          arthur lewis
           yes we did
                          59
                         
                         
                          anna
           hopefully it made clear that even
           in a worst case situation we will
           pay off any and all fines and be
           able to move forward with very
           comfortable capital on hand
                         
          abel jumps in taking some offense
                         
                          abel
           but you should know arthur that
           this man has been digging through
           our industry for over two years
           looking for anything he can find
           and as you know probably better
           than anyone having worked with
           some of our competitors the thought
           that he would have singled us out
           is ridiculous it reeks of
           everything that is wrong with this
           city right now we run a fair and
           clean business and follow every
           standard industry practice and i
           will fight til my last day to
           prove that
          this silences the table for a long beat
                         
                          abel contd
           but but
                         
          abel holds up his finger and points at arthur across the
          table to make his point
                         
                          abel contd
           dont think for a moment that i
           am going to allow this mess to
           interfere with our plan to grow we
           need to know you are standing by
           us
                         
           bank vp ian thompson
           yes what is it with this piece of
           property that you find so integral
           or that cant be put off til after
           this legal matter is dealt with
                         
          abel is a little taken aback by this comment it goes against
          everything that comes naturally to him as a person anna and
          andrew know this and are concerned he might go off
                         
          abel thinks it through
                          60
                         
                         
                          abel
           thats a very good question this
           property gives us many things
           firstly direct access to the river
           so i can bring in fuel directly
           from any provider in the world
           straight to my tanks then it has
           over 10 million gallons of storage
           capacity so i can buy in the
           summers when my price is low and
           sell to my customers and most
           importantly some of my competitors
           when the price is high i wont
           just drive trucks anymore i will
           control my fate but the real
           answer to your question
                         
          now abel stares right at ian thompson
                         
                          abel contd
            is that when it feels scary to
           jump ian that is exactly when
           you must jump or you risk ending
           up staying in the same place your
           whole life and that i cant do
          ian thompson awkwardly laughs a bit as abel just stays deadly
          serious staring right at him finally
                         
                          arthur lewis
           weve always been there with you
           and know that we will continue to
           be
                         
                         
          int abels car  night
                         
          abel is driving and anna sits in silence looking out the
          passenger window they are heading along the main backwoods
          road to their house
                         
                          anna

          in time the car hits the deer and it careens over the
          windshield and on to the road behind the car
                         
          he continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete
          stop
                         
          they both catch their breath and look around to make sure
          they are both okay then they look back at the deer it is
          laying on the road but is still breathing

          abel gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood he
          then walks back and approaches the animal it is laying on
          the side of the road
                         
          he comes right up to it and stares into its eyes it stares
          back at him abel walks back to the car
                         
                          anna

                          anna
           what are you doing

           getting the tire iron!
          this whole situation has stressed them out and they are on
          edge
                         
          abel goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench he
          walks back over to the deer he bends down next to it and
          stares into its eye again abel is thinking back on
          something or many things
          he makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it
          over the head but he stops himself he cant quite do it
          then he sits with the animal a beat longer
                         
          we come in very close to abel and see his hand is struggling
          to deliver the blow just as he grips the tire iron
          waiting bang! bang!
                         
          two very loud gunshots go off from right over his shoulder
          he ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him anna stands
          there holding a smallyetpowerful saturday night special
          style handgun smoke is still rising from the end of the
          pistol the deer is dead
                         
          he looks at her dumbfounded where did she get this gun
          she gives him a look then turns and walks back to the car
          he stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road

          without saying a word we stay with them as they drive on in
          silence

          int main living/dining room of morales house  next day
                         
          there are twelve sevenyearolds sitting around the dining
          room table yelling happy birthday to one of the morales
          daughters as she blows out the candles a large group of the
          parents surround the table
                         
                          group
           happy birthday!

          nanny maria heads to the front door the camera stays with
          the party nanny maria comes back into the room and standing
          behind her we see a police officer holding some kind of
          clipboard
                         
          abel walks over quickly trying not to create a scene he
          leads the police officer back over to the front door the
          parents certainly notice and start stirring
                         
                         
          ext front steps  day
                         
          abel leads the officer outside and as he looks up he sees
          that his driveway is packed with four police cars some
          unmarked and there are about five officers waiting to come
          into the house
                         
                          abel

                          66

          sees the scene in her driveway

          abel is seething and can only manage a slight nod
                         
          as they look across the driveway they see the officer talking
          to someone the officer shifts out of the way and they see he
          is talking to assistant da lawrence

          jumps over the edge and she starts handing boxes down to him
          he then stops again

          when the last one goes she looks up at the asst da to give
          him the allclear but as she does she gives him a look that
          could kill the police file into the house in front of her
                         
          ext underneath the deck  day

          and is putting the last one in place he sits down on the
          pile and looks out into the woods in sadness
                         
                         
          int main living/dining room of morales house
                         
          anna is looking around the house as the cops search through
          everything she seems oddly calm she decides that they are
          being respectful and heads out into the driveway
                         
                         
          ext driveway

          the house and stands near her they wait
                         
                          anna
           this is probably one that you are
           going to regret
                         
          lawrence looks at her trying to figure her out
                         
           ada lawrence
           excuse me
                         
                          anna
           my husband is a very honorable man
           coming on a saturday its very
           aggressive
                         
           ada lawrence
           this is standard
                         
                          anna
           really i know you think you are
           just doing your job but we are not
           what you think we are and you have
           embarrassed him in front of his
           family and friends
                         
          she gives him a long almost scary look
                          70

           good for you my husband is not my
           father not even close so if i
           were you i would start treating us
           with a little more respect or hell
           make it our only mission to ruin
           you this was very disrespectful
           and you are not going to find a
           fucking thing

          the furnace doing the exact same procedure that abel did in
          the training session

          just then he brings out the white cloth and wipes the inside
          of the exhaust and he then does the pause and the look just
          as he was taught he holds the look for a very long beat we
          hear a door opening upstairs and then feet walking across the
          floor

          as the sales kid goes through the door a massive fist of
          someone who has been waiting on the other side of the door
          comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our kids

          julian is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to
          feel better just as the traffic in front of him starts to
          clear up out of the corner of his eye he sees something
          in his sideview mirror he sees louis servidio getting out of
          a random car behind him his heart starts racing he looks
          over in the other mirror and there is thug #2 walking up
          again
                         
          julian thinks for a second then reaches for the cb radio
                         
                          julian
           cathy! they are coming again over
           help help on bridge
                         
          he then fumbles the cb and it drops to the floor of the cab
          he looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are
          still coming for him
                         
          the camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a
          long second and he then makes his decision he reaches under
          his seat and takes out a handgun he doesnt really seem to
          know what he is doing with it
                         
          but he opens the door of the truck and gets out he aims the
          gun at louis servidio walking towards him louis servidio
          sees him and is very surprised and stops
                         
                          louis servidio

          he glances over at thug #2
                          julian

          people in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk
          then louis servidio gives a nod signal to thug #2 who is on
          the other side of the truck and julians gun fires by
          mistake it totally misses thug #2 he jumps out of the way
          and is hiding behind the wheel
                         
           louis servidio contd
           watch it now man youre going to
           hurt someone
                         
          julian is now in a total state of panic he is hiding back in
          front of the truck the three men are basically doing a slow
          motion very stressful hideandseek around the truck the
          two thugs now have their guns out
                         
          the honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic
          is backing up
          then thug #2 makes one last play to take the truck he tries
          to climb into the cab and julian goes into a rage he quickly
          fires three shots missing thug #2 with each one but that
          forces louis servidio to shoot two shots of his own at julian
          to protect thug #2 they miss as well but one hits the main
          section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating
          oil starts pouring out onto the roadway
                         
          just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the
          background this adds a new element
                         
           louis servidio contd

          julian is just trying to decide what to do next the sirens
          are now getting much closer
                          76

          all alone with the police coming as julian is hiding trying
          to figure out what to do next louis servidio goes running by
          him as he does
                         
           louis servidio contd
           run for it!
          julian thinks for a second and then runs
                         
                         
          ext 59th street bridge  day
                         
          julian runs all along the bridge and then sees louis servidio
          run through a small door into the body of one of the four
          massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge
                         
                         
          int the 59th street bridge support column  day
                         
          once he is inside theres another set of stairs he locks
          the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs as he
          heads down he hears someone just in front of him
          he stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and
          looking up at him about three flights away is louis servidio
                         
                          louis servidio

           fuck you!
                         
          julian is screaming in a fit of panic at this point
                         
                          louis servidio
           hey man relax calm down did
           they see you come in here
                         
          julian cant stop breathing very heavy at this point
                         
                          julian
           i dont think so
                          77
                         
                         
                          louis servidio
           did they or not
          he thinks
                         
                          julian
           no
                         
                          louis servidio

           bridge they wont be there

           youre welcome
                         
          then louis servidios head disappears and we can hear his
          feet flying down the steps again
                         
          julian thinks for a beat then he starts off down the stairs
          again as well the camera stays right where it was as julian
          heads down out of sight we just hear the sounds of his feet
          getting lower and lower
                         
                         
          int bridge ground floor  day
                         
          julian comes to the first door and looks at it we can hear
          sirens in the distance on the other side of the door he
          keeps going
                         
          down two more flights just as he said there is another
          doorway julian walks up to that door very carefully he
          listens on the other side but doesnt hear anything but his
          own breath
                         
                         
          int stair landing lowest level  day
                         
          then we hear the door back up top fly open julian then
          quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of
          his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him
          he looks around and after a second to get himself
          orientated we see hes on a riverfront esplanade where there
          are many people jogging and walking enjoying the evening
                          78
                         
                         
          julian looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the
          gun out in the open he puts it away and then looks up at the
          bridge that is hovering above him
                         
          he knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge
                         
           fade to black
                         
          over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large
          truck it gets louder and louder
                         
          int of a very large empty dumpster  day
                         
          we now see that sales student alex is inside a massive empty
          construction dumpster and as he looks around we realize it
          is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty
          fast with each bump that the truck goes over the noise
          inside the dumpster is deafening as the kid comes to his
          senses he tries to stand up as he does we see that the
          sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the
          interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on
          he is trapped
                         
          just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to
          a stop it idles for a minute then begins backing up it
          stops a warning beeping alarm is heard and finally one end
          of the dumpster begins rising as it gets higher and higher
          our kid tries to hold himself back but he begins to slide
          towards the low end as he does he sees that the end that he
          is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing
          open finally the thing is at such an angle that he cant
          hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening
                         
          as he falls out he/we see that hes being dumped over the
          edge of a cliff of some sort he falls probably 1012 feet
          into a pile of garbage as he gathers himself and tries to
          stand we see he is standing in a massive landfill he looks
          around as the truck pulls away hes left totally alone
                         
                         
          int tennis court of suburban mansion  day
                         
          abel is led by a maid into an indoor tennis court the house
          is massive and designed like an english country estate
                         
          as abel walks up we see peter forente on the court playing
          against an automatic tennis ball machine he is in full
          tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine
                         
          abel approaches the court and watches for a beat
                          79

          abels face he hits one last shot and walks a little closer
          to abel the machine is still hitting balls behind peter

          peters face he hopes not but he is judging to see if peter
          had anything to do with all these attacks peter just looks
          back at him with a very strong poker face

          that is coming from the cb radio in the front seat as he

          and picks up the microphone

          back at abel through the windshield the mansion is looming
          in the background we see abels face react as he hears the
          news of the incident on the bridge the camera pulls back as
          abels face goes totally cold

          packing up his things at the front of the room they catch
          each others eye abel makes his way forward as everyone else
          leaves they look at each other for a beat

           against doing this sort of thing
           it is terrible for me
                         
           ada lawrence

           one piece of many so while i
           appreciate you coming here i
           have nothing i can tell you

          nothing just waiting

          passenger seat and the three daughters are in the back anna
          and abel do not look any better in fact there is now a tinge
          of anger mixed into the sadness
                         
          the daughters are arguing about whos taking up too much room
          in the back seat
                         
                          daughters
           move
                         
                          anna

          elizabeth middle nudges annie oldest so she gives
          catherine youngest a good hit anna sees it and freaks

           thats it annie weve told you
                         
          before anna can get the full sentence out abel suddenly pulls
          the car off the side of the highway into the grass everyone
          in the car is taken aback the road is a smaller scenic
          highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence
          still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by
          right next to them
                         
          ext highway  day
                         
          abel gets out of the car and slams the door he walks around
          the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway
          he goes around to his oldest daughters door and pulls annie
          from the car they stand behind the car and go at it with the
          traffic flying by abel is louder than he has been in the
          entire film he is losing it from all the pressure but his
          daughter bears the brunt
                         
                          abel
           you are thirteen years old what
           are you doing your mother asks you
           an hour ago to help her get out of
           the house smoothly and you are
           acting like an
                         
                          annie
           oh fuck you!
                         
                          abel
           what what what are you talking
           about
                         
          abel is looking around for someone to help him and witness
          this he then switches he has had enough and gets right up
          in her face
                          89
                         
                         
                          abel contd
           im not sure who the hell you think
           you are but you dont talk to me
           that way you are in serious
           danger of becoming a rich little
           spoiled brat and i can tell you
           from experience there is nothing
           worse in the world than a rich
           little girl who thinks the whole
           world revolves around her
          annie is yelling back over the traffic
                         
                          annie
           the world revolves around me me!
           what about her and what about you
           youre both so totally obsessed
           with your stupid business you
           walk around like you are saving the
           world but what are you doing
           nothing!
                         
          this stings he now changes his tone to a quiet low roar but
          he cant keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling
          again
                          abel
           first off i dont walk around like
           i am saving anything i chose this
           business because i looked at the
           world and said whats the last
           bill people stop paying every month
           when they are low on cash cause
           thats a business i want to be in
           cause failure wasnt much of an
           option for me i lived in
           reality not whatever this world
           is you are living in and we help
           people stay warm which isnt all
           that bad
           now he is yelling again
           maybe youve got grander ambitions
           but for now this is how you eat
           sleep and get all dressed up so
           you better shape the fuck up and
           never speak to me like this again!
                         
                          anna
           stop!!
                         
          they both look over and anna is standing there a calmness
          suddenly falls down on all of them
                          90
                         
                         
          int annas car on highway  day
          all five of them are sitting in the car sadness prevails
                         
                         
          int anna morales library  night
                         
          the camera moves slowly across a dark hallway we hear the
          sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away as we come
          through the doorway we see anna morales sitting at her desk
          in a pool of light from the desk lamp she is deep in it
          crunching numbers finally abel walks into the doorway he
          looks exhausted
                         
                          abel
           hey
                         
          she looks up with a small but sweet smile
                         
                          anna
           hi

           that was a good year
                         
          anna gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally
          support that claim
                         
                          abel contd
           well it was for mehow is it

           bad as they are saying it is
           turns out i kinda knew what i was
           doing
                         
          they give each other a slight smile

           one piece from saul but were
           still about a million short
                         
          they look at each other with concern
                          91

           probably
                         
          as they look at each other abel
                         
                          anna
           this is all worth it
                         
          he pauses just long enough to think
                         
                          abel
           of course
                         
          a sense of caring and resolve comes over them at least now
          they know what needs to be done
                          abel contd
           you should get to bed

           i love you too
                         
          abel turns to go upstairs as anna starts in again with the
          machine
                         
                         
          int hallway outside of julians apartment  day
                         
          andrew stands in the hallway about to knock but he waits for
          a beat he knocks
                         
          the door opens to a young woman presumably julians wife
          luisa
                         
                          andrew walsh

           no
                          andrew walsh
           abel would like to speak with him
           to help him
                         
                          luisa
           i will tell him
          julian steps into the frame from behind her
                         
                         
          ext/int large latemodel american car parked  day
                         
          a driver is sitting in the drivers seat andrew walks up and
          gets in the front seat julian gets into the back and looks
          over at abel who is sitting next to him they drive off and
          nobody says a word for a very very long time
                         
                         
          ext empty parking lot  day
                         
          the car finally pulls into a large empty parking lot for a
          couple beats julian has a look on his face that he may be
          getting rubbed out
          then off in the distance we see two cop cars the car pulls
          up to them and stops abel and the driver get out of the car
          without a word but andrew stays and turns around and now
          gives him a total debrief
                         
                          julian
           hes turning me in
                         
          andrew looks at him without much remorse
                         
                          andrew walsh
           of course we are turning you in
           you have put everything that man
           has worked for for the last 20
           years at risk if it was up to me
           we would be dealing with this in a
           very different way
                         
                          julian
           but i know things
                         
          this causes andrew to turn quickly back to him with as sharp
          a look as he has
                         
                          andrew walsh
           really
                          93
                         
                         
                          julian
           yes
                          andrew walsh
           and what things do you know
                         
          julian looks back at him
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           i strongly suggest you think that
           through before you answer it
           because even if you did what does
           it do for you nothing there is
           nothing there for you to gain
           nothing
                         
                          julian
           im sorry
                         
                          andrew walsh
           i am too
                         
          andrew now changes his tone
                         
           andrew walsh contd
           they say they have you firing four
           shots is that right
                         
                          julian
           i dont know
                         
                          andrew walsh
           wheres the gun
                         
          julian stutters for a moment then
                         
                          julian
           i threw it in the river
                         
                          andrew walsh
           good your background check with us
           says you have never been arrested
           is that true
                         
                          julian
           why is this putting everything at
           risk
                         
                          andrew walsh
           have you ever been arrested
                         
                          julian
           no
                          94
                         
                         
                          andrew walsh
           because no bank will touch us right
           now so we cant close on the new
           property and hes going to lose
           everything on his deposit
                         
          this sits heavily on julian andrew hands him a card

                          abel
           i have always been much more scared
           of failure than anything else
                         
                          julian
           i

                          julian

           week maybe

                          abel
           good
                         
                          julian
           no i am not strong
                         
                          abel
           that does not have to be true
                         
                          julian
           trust me i am not im sorry
                         
          with that julian walks across the parking lot towards the
          police to turn himself in andrew walks up behind abel and
          stands there looking
                          andrew walsh
           im late i will meet you at four
                         
                          abel
           im gonna try to get us a little
           more time
                         
          the three cops are standing waiting as julian walks towards
          them abel turns around facing the camera and closes his
          eyes in sadness
                         
          with abel in the foreground we see julian make it halfway to
          the cops then he stops
                         
                          cop 1
           hey
                         
          abels face tells us he knows what is coming
                         
          julian sets off running before the cops can get close to him
          he is off abel turns and sees what is happening he does not
          follow chase his head just drops
                          96
                         
                         
          ext various 1980s urban decay landscapes
          we are now with julian again running but as this chase
          continues we see his face turn from fear to desperation to
          a creeping sense of evil he does not know how it has come to
          this but as he jumps down from fences and runs across
          deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning
                         
          as he runs through some of the most bombedout destroyed
          sections of queens he just never stops with each step his
          fear turns to anger
                         
                         
          ext blownout building
                         
          he stops collapses and hides behind a blownout building
          wall just as a cop car drives by he starts to almost cry
          but then it again becomes something else his survival
          instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become
          of it anger

           that we find him safely

          where he was hiding and knocks over abel julian runs to the
          front door with abel chasing him
                         
          he starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed abel
          follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless

          for julian
                         
          abel then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees
          luisa standing there in the hall he walks back up to her in
          an aggressive way we fear for her he gets right up in her
          face but does not touch her
                         
                          abel

           grandfather was able to communicate
           to you how much i have always
           respected him and it was only out
           of respect for the business he had
           built and because i knew of his
           reservations and feelings about
           your uncles and your father that i
           made those offers

          int long island italian restaurant  night
                         
          a hostess leads abel and andrew through the whole main dining
          room and through a side kitchen
                         
          int italian restaurant  private dining room  night
                         
          finally they come through a door and into a small back
          private dining room where fifteen of their competitors a
          couple of whom we have already met including lorraine and
          saul lefkowitz and arnold kline are sitting around the
          table meeting and waiting for them to arrive the whole room
          looks up at them
                         
          oleary is at the head of the table at the far end of the
          room he stands up to greet them and then so does the rest of
          the room
                         
                          bill oleary
           abel please sit
                         
          finally everyone settles and the room falls quiet
                         
           bill oleary contd
           abel
                         
          now the room is silent as it waits and waits for him to
          speak
                         
                          abel
           stop
                          108
                         
                         
          abel is deadly serious he just lets this sit and looks
          around the room at each person they all seem to be waiting
          for him to continue but he doesnt he just lets this sit
          finally peter forente who is across from abel shifts in his
          seat and leans forward
                         
                          peter forente
           um abel we had a chance to
           meet for a little bit before you
           got here and of course everyone
           in this room is fully capable of
           lying to their own mothers on their
           deathbeds but the conclusion we
           have come to i should say we are
           fairly convinced after a very frank
           conversation that these guys who
           are doing this that they dont
           actually work for anyone in this
           room as you know there are many
           other smaller providers in the area
           that might be responsible who are
           not here tonight
                         
          this sits in the room for a long beat everyone then shifts
          back their attention to abel waiting for his response
          finally
                          abel
           peter thank you that may be
           true
                         
          he stops and thinks about how to continue
                         
                          abel contd
           but over the last six months
           110000 gallons of fuel has been
           stolen from my family and i now
           the reason we asked bill to get you
           all here is because the people in
           this room are the only people
           within two hundred miles of here
           who have the ability to purchase
           and store that kind of quantity
           so no matter what bullshit you
           have been telling each other one of
           you or two or three has
           been allowing this to happen by
           buying this from these cowards or
           worse yet hiring these guys just to
           do it and profiting from it so
           what i am saying is stop! now
           have some pride in what you do and
           stop

          int anna morales library  night
          the camera moves slowly across a dark hallway we hear the
          sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away as we come
          through the doorway we see anna morales sitting at her desk
          in a pool of light from the desk lamp she is deep in it
          crunching numbers finally abel walks into the doorway he
          looks exhausted
                         
                          abel
           hey

                          anna

           that was a good year
          anna gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally
          support that claim
                         
                          abel contd

          int abels car  driving  day
          abel is driving towards the office and is listening to the
          idle chatter on the radio between the dispatcher and the
          drivers who are out they are underneath the brooklyn queens
          expressway in stop and go traffic
                         
          suddenly a panic stricken voice blasts through on the radio
                         
           senior driver eddy vo

           eddy eddy
                         
          abel looks up at the street where they are and realizes this
          is going down right down the street from them hes had
          enough
                         
          he pulls across the intersection and heads down a street he
          comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the
          truck comes flying by
                         
          he looks to his right and sees eddy standing at the side of
          the road but he wants to end this so he pulls out and
          starts following the truck leaving eddy behind
                         
          abel follows the truck for several blocks through the
          industrial neighborhood he is tempted to pull up alongside
          of it to see who is driving but doesnt he continues to
          follow him
                          112
                         
                         
          they get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn
          and as they are turning louis servidio who is sitting in
          the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that abel is
          following him it now turns into a high speed chase as the
          driver steps on it
                         
          they race down a ramp into a railyard abel chases the truck
          as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned
          tunnel the truck races into the tunnel and abel follows the
          truck is throwing up a dust storm and abel has a difficult
          time seeing where he is going but he keeps up
                         
          the roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and abels car
          are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the
          tunnel
                         
          the light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through
          the dust but we cant see the truck as abel comes into the
          light he has to slam on his brakes because the truck has
          flipped over in front of him
                         
          as he gets out of his car he sees louis servidio jumping down
          from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard abel
          looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the driver has
          been killed there is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck
          and abel looks and thinks he then picks up the gun and
          chases after louis servidio
                         
          in the distance he sees louis servidio leave the yard and
          head up into an elevated subway station
                         
                         
          ext subway station  day
                         
          abel runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a
          leaving train just as the doors shut abel looks around
          there are three people in his car it is covered in graffiti
          he starts making his way down to the end of the train where
          the guy is
                         
          he looks into the last car and sees louis servidio and just
          bull rushes him to the ground he starts beating on him very
          very badly with the pistol all the rage comes out of him he
          then aims the gun at louis servidio
                         
                          louis servidio
           please please
                         
          they stare at each other
                         
                          abel
           your friend is dead who do you
           work for
                          113
                         
                         
                          louis servidio
           you know i could never tell you
           that

                          louis servidio
           this was it anyway okay okay
          abel looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun
          and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up
          and looks back at abel
                         
           louis servidio contd
           thank you
                         
          louis servidio then runs out of the car as the door opens
          abel sits up and slows his breathing down finally he looks
          around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the
          car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him
                         
                         
          int brooklyn barbershop  day

          but is worse for the wear arnold kline is sitting in one of
          the chairs waiting he turns to abel

                          abel
           thats how much has been taken from
           me over the last six months
                          arnold kline
           i had nothing to do with that
                         
                          abel
           your far rockaway facility bought a
           load of fuel last week off one of
           my stolen trucks
                         
                          arnold kline
           thats not possible
                         
                          abel
           i was standing on top of one of my
           hijacked trucks a couple weeks ago
           thinking about the cowards who did
           this when i remembered i had bought
           the load of fuel off a friends
           tanker straight from texas as im
           sure you know texas #4 is marked
           but that was just one load so
           every truck that has left my lot
           for the last two weeks has been
           marked with dye that ive put in
           and luckily four more of my trucks
           got jacked since my guess is
           there are at least 4600 gallons of
           marked fuel in your small tank
           right now
                         
          no answer finally
                         
                          arnold kline

          abel gets ready to leave
                          115
                         
                         
                          arnold kline
           ive just been buying this stuff

           couple loads i dont know who they
           are i would never do that
                         
                          abel
           my goal was to have you out of
           business by the end of next year
           and if youre this fucking
           desperate it doesnt seem like it
           will even take that long
                         
          he walks away
                         
                          arnold kline
           abel i wasnt the only person
           buying this shit
                         
          he turns
                         
                          abel

                          arnold kline
           it may ruin me
                          abel
           when you find out who else it was
           you can get them to pay you back
           the difference kinda makes you
           miss having your father around but
           i need the whole lot tomorrow or
           the feds will be at your doorstep
           by noon
                         
          he leaves
                         
                         
          ext university athletic field  day
                         
          abel is sitting on a bleacher totally alone watching a prep
          school football practice we stay with him as he sits quietly
          just watching
                         
          eventually his 21yearold younger brother elias comes
          walking off the field over to him players start leaving the
          field

          abel looks across as a small group of girls field hockey
          players walk across the field in front of them they watch
          them pass and walk away
                          abel contd
           the girls at this place they are
           so beautiful

                          elias

          abel stands and looks around for a good bit then thinks
          about sitting down again
                         
                          abel contd

                          anna
           enough
                         
          after a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him
                         
                          abel

           different parties itll be a
           mess and the terms peter
           suddenly showed me his true colors

           me
                         
          he sits there for a long beat and then she comes and hands
          him a piece of paper with a series of numbers on it he looks
          up at her
                         
                          abel contd

                          anna

           peters money and get him out of
           the deal
                          abel
           where did it come from
                         
                          anna
           abel
                         
                          abel
           where did it come from
                         
          she stops and thinks then
                         
                          anna
           since 1971 i have been skimming
           money out of the company some
           years a little others a lot in
           the beginning it was just in case
           times got tough but then it was
           because you were taking all these
           chances i didnt know what else
           to do i couldnt risk having us
           be left with nothing
                         
          this knocks him back
                         
                          anna contd
           im sorry
                         
                          abel
           what do you expect me to do with
           this
                         
                          anna
           use it abel
                         
                          abel
           is it clean
                         
                          anna
           what does that mean
                         
          he thinks that through
                          123
                         
                         
                          abel
           it means if you walked into the
           office of the people who have been
           trying to put us in jail right now
           and slapped a check from that
           account down on their desk would it
           push me further into hell or help
           to get me out
                         
                          anna
           its as clean as every other dollar
           weve ever made
                         
                          abel
           thats a fucking bullshit answer
                         
                          anna
           i can clear it on the books
                         
                          abel
           well it sounds like you should take
           this money and keep it right where
           it is because im going to
           pretend that we never had this
           conversation and you can use that
           when they drag me off to jail!
          with that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs she
          follows and is standing looking up at him
                         
                          anna
           so whats your plan here
                         
          he turns to her and squares off
                         
                          abel
           ill get it done and it wont be
           as a cheat
                         
                          anna
           yelling but controlled enough to
           not wake the kids
           oh you are too much youve been
           walking around your whole life like
           this all happened because of your
           hard work good luck and charm
           mr fucking american dream well
           this is america but its not a
           dream and that wasnt good luck
           helping you out all those years
           it was me! doing the things you
           didnt want to know about
                          124
                         
                         
                          abel
           you stole from me!
          this stops her in her tracks and eventually a little smile
          comes across her face she comes way down and almost delivers
          this line in a whisper
                         
                          anna
           oh you have always been very
           good about not letting your ego get
           in the way of business dont start
           now just because its me
                         
          with that abel turns up the stairs and heads to bed
                         
                         
          int master bathroom  morning
                         
          abel is getting ready for the day shaving he looks
          exhausted anna comes into the room she stands at the
          entryway just looking at him for a very long beat
                         
                          abel
           well use the money your money

           fade to black
                         
          before we see anything we hear the sound of a pen writing on
          paper
                         
                         
          int the temporary office trailer  day

          heads outside

          abel comes out and we see anna standing outside the trailer
          in the cold because these guys dont do business with women
          he hands her the document under her breath

           fair price on it
                         
          with that they both smile she signs it and then gives him a
          kiss

          abel walks across the lot with joy although it seems masked
          by a sadness he looks around as andrew and anna come up next
          to him

           somehow youve ended up with
           everything you wanted
                         
          abel looks at the gun in his hand
                         
                          abel
           it wasnt meant to be
                         
                          julian
           what is that supposed to mean
                          127
                         
                         
                          abel
           i know what you wanted but you
           need to forget that you are
           looking backward only look
           forward that is what you can
           control
                         
                          julian
           im sorry you gave me a very good
           chance right
                          abel
           yes
                         
                          julian
           probably a better chance than i
           deserved
                         
                          abel
           no
                         
                          julian
           please take care of my family
                         
                          abel
           julian
                          julian
           please
                         
          abel looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at
                         
                          abel
           i will
                         
          with that julian takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and
          pulls the trigger
                         
          the gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side
          of the fuel tank that is behind him
                         
          abel and the rest are left totally in shock they are beside
          themselves but out of the corner of his eye abel notices
          that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid
          the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out
          through the bullet hole onto the ground
                         
          abel steps around julians body and goes over to the hole he
          picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the
          hole plugging the flow of oil
                         
                          andrew walsh
           what what should we do
                          128
                         
                         
          abel turns and looks back at him
                          abel
           we call the police
                         
                          andrew walsh
           really
                         
                          abel
           yes!
          with that he walks off behind the tanks
                         
                         
          ext parking lot next to the tank farm site  day
                         
          there are now police vehicles everywhere abel is standing
          off alone the da gets out of a car all alone and walks over
          to abel

           i did
           ada lawrence
           he must have been under a hell of a
           lot of pressure
                         
                          abel
           yeah for a while i thought he
           was its just

                          abel
           you really do have to be lucky
                         
           ada lawrence
           yes so you are chasing down
           hijackers now
                         
                          abel
           i was right there i couldnt
           help myself
                         
          lawrence nods approval
                          129
                         
                         
                          abel contd

           ada lawrence
           no
                         
                          abel
           youll find him
                         
           ada lawrence
           probably not
                         
                          abel
           well thank you for coming i
           wanted to make sure this was
           handled correctly
                         
           ada lawrence
           of course
                         
                          abel
           im not sure how i got here
                         
           ada lawrence
           yeah
                          abel
           so i should tell you that i
           wont be able to take that deal you
           offered there is no way i would
           ever accept a felony charge for
           anything weve done
                         
           ada lawrence
           i know
                         
                          abel
           i am not a felon
                         
           ada lawrence
           thats probably true
                         
                          abel
           but i also cant have you digging
           around my life and keeping this
           hanging around my neck for the next
           ten years i love fighting a good
           battle but this its very bad
           for my business
                         
          this gets lawrences attention
                          130
                         
                         
                          abel contd
           so we need to come to some sort of
           conclusion
                         
           ada lawrence
           we can probably do that
                         
                          abel
           good
          they both look out for a beat
                         
           ada lawrence
           i hear you closed on this terminal
           today
                         
                          abel
           it looks that way
                         
           ada lawrence
           i didnt realize that you had that
           in the works
                         
                          abel
           for a very long time
           ada lawrence
           that will put you in quite a
           powerful position
                         
                          abel
           within my business it has that
           potential
                         
          lawrence shifts his tone ever so slightly
                         
           ada lawrence
           if you get this place up and
           running again it will have
           significant influence
           politically speaking
                         
          abel picks up on the word politically and stares down
          lawrence
                         
           ada lawrence contd
           we all have our ambitions
                         
                          abel
           yes
                         
          lawrence gives a slight smile and then pauses
                          131
                         
                         
           ada lawrence
           and sometimes we need help to get
           there youve come a very long
           way
                         
                          abel
           yes i have
                         
           ada lawrence
           in a very short time
                          abel
           it doesnt feel that way but
           please know that i have always
           chosen the path that was the most
           right
                         
           ada lawrence
           the most right
                         
                          abel
           yes
                         
           ada lawrence
           that one makes my head hurt a
           little
                          abel
           the result is never in question for
           me just what path do i take to get
           there and i have never questioned
           my path there is always one that
           is most right and that is what
           this is
                         
           ada lawrence
           i hope so
                         
          they look at each other and then out over the city
                         
                         
                         
                          the end
