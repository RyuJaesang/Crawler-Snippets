               beverly hills street  night

               it is late night and deserted engine noise approaches 
               headlights appear as the car draws closer we hear singing

               it is a mercedes convertible and as it roars by the singing  
               a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano  whooshes by with 
               it

               we hold as another car approaches this one is a conservative 
               sedan whose occupant does not sing

               inside the convertible

               the middleaged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt 
               and cocked bow tie he is flushed a rogue forelock bouncing 
               over his forehead and he merrily sings casey jones along 
               with the passenger a young woman in a party dress who 
               squeals rocks with the motion of the car and 
               enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus

               another empty street

               the convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and 
               approaches with its singing

               reverse

               the car enters and roars away after a beat of quiet the 
               conservative sedan enters and recedes

               we are at the malibu guest quarters motel the singing 
               squealing mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a 
               halt

               halfempty bottle of champagne

               straightens his bow tie he puffs his bounding forelock with 
               one finger nods his head to make it bounce grins 
               approvingly and cocks a pistolfinger at his own reflection

               barely cover his massive overdeveloped musculature on his 
               head a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet he 
               grabs the woman yanks her back towards him she reacts 
               swiftly with a ferocious no she stomps on his foot and 
               smashes him in the face the mugger raises his hands in a 
               gesture of submission

               applause

               we pull back and see that we are in a self defense class 
               two instructors two muggers and ten women students all 
               wearing tshirts with the words impactpersonal safety 
               marylin and sarah sit against the wall

                                     marylin

                         he has a reputation for being tough

               marylin watches as a new victim begin her walk across the 
               gym

                                     marylin

                         oh god!

               the mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward 
               the victim she glances over her shoulder and at the sight 
               of the monster bearing down on her screams and runs to the 
               exit marylin and sarah giggle but reproachful looks from 
               the other students force them to affect concerned looks

                                     marylin
                              whispers

               the two instructors and the mugger try to coax the sobbing 
               woman back into the room they clasp her in an empathic group 
               hug

               lays a consoling hand on her shoulder

               later

               marylin rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on 
               the witness stand she is modestly dressed and her attitude 
               is one of shocked wounded innocence

                                     marylin

               he paces hands clasped behind his back affecting to be 
               lost in thought

               marylin watches him

                         battery

               marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled 
               irritation miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a 
               faint smile

                         cold well maybe not to you massey 
                         but

               miles flashes marylin a you are kidding look but she 
               assiduously avoids eye contact

                                     marylin
                         howard and i are here miles because 
                         i have learned through bitter 
                         experience that when it comes to 
                         matrimonial law you are the very 
                         best

               miles acknowledges this with a curt nod

                                     marylin
                         as you are well aware my previous 
                         marriage ended with an unjustified 
                         strain on my reputation my motives 
                         were questioned i was slandered in 
                         court

                                     doyle

                         therefore in an effort to remove any 
                         trace of suspicion from my sweet 
                         howard  i wish to execute a pre
                         nuptial agreement

                         they say the massey prenup has never 
                         been penetrated

                                     doyle
                         she said penetrate heh heh heh

                         they brought in and earned during 
                         no one can profit from the marriage

               a flowering ficus

                                     miles

               the woman has her arm around one of them the other stands 
               close to her smiling but awkward and tentative

                                     marylin

                         sensitive child you have expressive 
                         eyes

               miles walks over to look at the picture

                                     miles
                         hmmm

                         and your mother was very beautiful 
                         she must be proud of you

                                     miles
                         she never particularly cared for me

                                     marylin
                         she didnt love you

                         eat well we got off to a bad start 
                         and she never seemed to recoup 

                                     marylin
                         she held that against you

                                     miles
                         apparently she was very disappointed

                         been frightened of this emotion which

                         is fluttering and threatens to die  
                         should we seek to extinguish that 
                         flame so that we can sift through 
                         the smoldering wreckage for our paltry 
                         reward or should we seek to fan 
                         this precious flame  this most 
                         precious flame  back to loving

                         build should we meet our clients

               mist and lets out a horrified

                                     miles
                         joe!

               bang! the offscreen gunshot is followed by the sound of a 
               body dropping heavily to the floor

               silence

               marylin runs over to miles they look sadly down at the floor

               miles sits gazing sadly out the window

               the room is empty

               there is the whir of ventilation

               the click of the door attracts both their attention and brings 
               them to their feet

               marylin walks in chic and beautiful as ever followed by 
               ruth who sits next to her places her attaché case on the 
               table top and snaps its clasps

               there is an uncomfortable shifting in seats wrigley looks 
               at miles

                                     wrigley

                         a burglar broke into your house  
                         became despondent over his lifestyle 
                         and shot himself

                         we think its more than generous

               miles ignores the paper which lies unclaimed on the middle 
               of the table he looks at marylin

               he decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen looks 
               down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name

               he pushes the paper across the table toward marylin

               gazing at him seeking the truth in his eyes she absently 
               picks up the paper

               there is a long silence we hear only the hum of ventilation 
               and wrigleys quiet snuffling

               ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses  over 
               marylins shoulder  at the sheet of paper marylin however 
               looks only at miles
