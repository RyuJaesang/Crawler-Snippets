          pockets and some kind of gothy tshirt  a look that ought
          to be out of style by now

          rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun he
          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
          application adding a few unnecessary moves/motions slapping
          each box when hes done generally making the activity look
          like more of a skill than it actually is he approaches step
          and hector pulling out some fliers from his many pockets

                         rory

          for just about any phsychological
          problem i mean basically it just
          makes you feel good so it sort of
          works for anything i even take it
          when i have a cold its probably
          great for sexual frustration want

          establishing shot a pawn shop in a strip mall cindys car
          parked out in front

          int pawn shop  continuous

          cindy is at the counter the gibson guitar we saw earlier is
          in front of her a pawn shop guy is counting out money he
          pauses looks around then speaks sympathetically to her

          pawn shop guy
          um you know im really not
          supposed to say this but since
          this belonged to your father and
          since he passed away and all

                         quietly
          you could probably get a better
          deal at a music store

                         cindy
          oh thats okay thanks but i
          just kind of wanna get it over
          with you know its kind of hard
          for me

          pawn shop guy
          i understand
          he looks around to see if his boss is watching then counts
          off a few more twenties feeling sorry for her

           pawn shop guy contd
          here

          int cindys car  moments later

          cindy puts the money in her wallet along with a drivers
          license

          close on the wallet
          cindy shuffles through three or four different drivers
          licenses on one her name says misty patterson its a
          kansas license she takes another one out from colorado
          with the name cindy metzler on it and puts that in front
          then puts the wallet away
          a newspaper sits on the front seat something grabs her
          attention

          angle on the newspaper
          we see an article about steps accident theres a picture
          of step being taken away on the stretcher
          cindy starts reading the article with growing interest

                         cindys pov
          she scans the article zeroing in on certain words
           potentially big settlement no testicles
          several million dollars then back to no testicles then
          quickly back and forth several times  million dollars no
          testicles million dollars no testicles
          on cindys face  a look of determination she looks one
          more time at the name under the picture  don step
          wilkenson then zeroes in on the words reynolds extract
          she starts the car and speeds away

          int reynolds extract building  conference room  day

          joel sits with brian brian has a clipboard going over the 
          days business 

                         brian
          so obviously steps not coming back
          anytime soon i had to hire a
          couple temps is that okay

                         joel 
          yeah sure how is step 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22

                         brian
          better they say hes going home
          in a couple of days speaking of
          which the guys at general mills
          heard about this whole step thing
          theyre worried if step decides
          to sue us  beyond the insurance
          settlement  it could be a serious
          liability they dont want to make
          an offer until this thing has
          settled

                         joel 
          really they think its that big 
          of a liability 

                         brian
          well yeah dont you i mean
          think about it imagine if you
          asked a bunch of jurors how much
          youd have to pay em to cut their
          balls off i mean i wouldnt let
          someone cut my balls off for a
          billion dollars seriously 
          unless there were some kind of
          really expensive operation that
          could give you artificial balls or
          something would you

                         joel 
          no i guess not 

                         brian
          anyway i wouldnt worry he says
          hes not going to sue us says he

                         crude imitation
          dont want somethin fer nothin 
          and whats right is right if we
          can just get him to sign something
          to that effect we should be fine

                         joel 
          boy step sure is being mellow 
          about all this 

                         brian
          yeah well i think when you lose
          your balls it mellows you out you
          dont get as pissed off and
          aggressive about things i know
          its true for horses and bulls

                         cindy

                         cindy
          you need to send a message so that
          a horrible accident like this never
          happens to anyone else ever again
          thats whats right and the way
          you do that is to take them to
          court

                         cindy
          maybe it was your lawyer but he
          talked to your doctor and your
          doctor said its very important not
          to get aroused until after the

                         joel
          feeling the buzz
          ah who cares

                         dean
          its just that ah special k is a
          horse tranquilizer kinda has a
          weird effect when people take it
          but well dont worry about
          it you might not want to drink
          too much more though

                         joel

          you know that thing you were
          talking about about the gigolo

                         dean

          boff whoever you want

                         joel
          what youll do is come to my house
          pretending to be the new pool
          cleaner then you simply try to
          seduce my wife okay if she
          doesnt respond you simply clean
          the pool and leave thats all
          its that simple
          hold on brad for a long beat

                         brad
          so uh youre not gonna touch my
          ass or anything

          while im not there posing as the
          new pool cleaner and then try to
          seduce her
          brad finally makes a breakthrough

                         joel
          remember she might not go for it
          brad starts to get a little too excited

          joel looks on with growing concern as brad cant seem to stop
          talking

                         brad
          cuz like i figure if i did a
          few jobs and i was like really
          good then maybe theyd tell their
          friends you know and theyd give
          me a what do you call those
          things

                         dean

                         brad
          yeah yeah those things then
          those women could tell more women
          and then itd be like i was like
          uh branching or

                         dean
          networking

                         brad
          yeah networking! totally then
          if i got enough of em maybe i
          could quit my landscaping job and
          do this full time that would be

          and my boss is a total dick

          ext scoreboards parking lot  night

          ext joels house  pool  day

           as brads dopey narration continues we see the story hes
           telling it plays out like a bad softporn flick on cinemax
           we see brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag

           brad v0
           i dont know anything about pool
           cleaning so i was just faking it
           she was in her bathing suit
          suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs

           brad v0
          so i struck up a conversation

                         brad

                         suzie

          45
          brads dopey narration comes back in

          brad v0
          i thought that was pretty smart
          of me  to ask her to borrow
          sunscreen see cuz that way
          once she gave me some i could ask
          her if she wanted some too and rub
          some on her back instead of just
          coming out and asking her to rub
          some on her pretty smooth huh
          we see brad rubbing lotion on suzies back as she lies face
          down on the chair

          brad v0
          once i was rubbing the sunscreen on
          her the rest was easy
          we see brads hands working their way down suzies back
          just as they start to move down towards her butt joel
          interrupts yanking us out of the flashback

                         joel
          okay thats enough! stop!

          joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair in a
          state of shock

                         joel
          quietly to himself

          notices something ahead and suddenly slams on the breaks

          stays in the car checking it out

          the backyard with rory on bass they are set up on the
          patio of this small twobedroom suburban house most of the
          people at the party are crowded around the keg which is on
          the other side of the backyard ignoring the band the band
          sounds awful  loud as hell unmusical uninspired the
          lead singer sings in that awful eddie vedder style but even
          more loud and overly dramatic rory acts all intense in
          stark contrast to the nonintensity of the music

          theres one drunk guy off to the side banging his head
          playing airguitar and stumbling into the bushes
          joel spots cindy over by the keg drinking mingling he
          watches her for a beat then shakes his head and drives away

                         joel
          ah what the hell
          willie instructs joel on the bong usage in the same
          condescending way a weightlifting instructor would

                         willie
          okay now this is a gravity bong

          mostly out of fear joel exhales willie puts the bong up to
          joels face lights it and starts lifting the plunger then

          it sells if general mills knew
          we were on strike they wouldnt
          buy this place until the strike was
          over that way theyd have to give
          us stock

           joel and the rest of them find page 18 joel is stunned by

          okay ill admit i made a big
          mistake i was drunk on drugs
          stressed sexually frustrated and i
          shouldnt have hired a male
          prostitute to seduce you but if
          you had simply been faithful none
          of this wouldve happened
          suzie just looks at him for a beat

          sociopath
          cindy looks like joel might be getting to her

                          joel contd
          you cant even admit that you stole

          do it

                         more

          if you said one true thing youd
          have to tell the truth about
          something else and then it would
          all unravel wouldnt it then
          youd have to admit that you stole
          this purse and god knows what else
          beat cindy still looking away down at the floor we see
          her eyes well up about to cry but joel doesnt notice

          joel walks towards the door then cindy slumps down on the
          couch mutters something still looking down at the floor
          her voice cracking slightly

          closer as her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
          even more finally she lifts her head and they start
          kissing as they get hot and heavy we

          then after a beat picks them up again checks inside the
          wallet and sees theres still cash and credit cards then he
          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees marys purse

          thought the worst part was having
          my balls knocked off but you know
          what the worse part is dealin
          with all this bullshit im sick
          of that adler guy tellin me what
          to do hes a real dick

                         joel
          yeah he sure is

                         step
          the truth is i just want to have
          my old life back  i just want to
          go back to work im a workin
          man thats what i do

                         joel
          yeah im beginning to think i
          might be the same way im a
          little worried about what id do
          with too much time on my hands

                         step
          i just lay around and watch tv all
          day

                         joel
          yeah i think i do a lot worse

                         step
          the problem is if i bankrupt the
          company there wont be a job to go
          back to

                         joel
          you dont have to bankrupt the
          company

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100

                         step
          yeah but then if i drop the
          lawsuit youll sell the company
          and the new company might not hire
          me

                         joel
          well maybe i dont have to sell
          the company you know ive been
          thinking all these years ive been
          building this company dreaming
          about the day i could sell it and
          retire but what would i really do
          if i retired its like that old
          saying  its not about the
          destination its about the
          journey
          step just stares at him blankly he lost him

                         joel
          i guess what im saying is too
          much free time might not be such a
          good thing  like that old saying
          idle hands are the devils
          playground
          steps never heard that one either

                         step
          im sorry i dont do much book
          readin

                         joel
          what im saying is im thinking
          maybe i wont sell the company

                         step
          really

                         joel
          that is if you dropped the
          lawsuit  and remember youll
          still get that insurance money 
          probably a couple hundred thousand
          what do you think

                         step
          hmm that sounds fair but
          under one condition

                         joel
          whats that

          gardens
