          one hand on the wheel the other on the door frame he
          begins to push the car
          he steers it not towards the dirt road but towards the
          shoulder where a steep incline leads downward since
          the blazer is pointed the wrong way matrix is pushing
          it uphillthe effort is incredible the veins on his

          the camera holds on this what looks like matrixs
          funeral pyre
          then we see movement and see a bloodied and injured
          matrix crawling away from the intense fire
          he stops and looks back at the destroyed blazer

          shaking from fear and her eyes are wet with tears
          matrix lunges up from the table but his hands and feet
          are chained to the table and he is stopped
          bennett wheels jenny out of the closet over to arius
