               a floor manager nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter

               we notice he has a pronounced limp

               yet and wont for a while

                the figure seen in soft focus passes a roulette table 
               the wheel already in midspin his hand casually brushes the 
               side of the table and we pan across to the wheel  just 
               in time to see the ball landing on 00 the players howl 
               defeat the croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a 
               slight nod of respect to the passing wraith

                tracking past some blackjack tables racking from the 
               passing figure still in soft focus to a dealer calling 
               out

               figure as the stickman calls it seven out! to a thundering 
               chorus of disappointment

                our figure passes by in the foreground while in the 
               background we see a growing line of shame at one of the atm 
               machines

                following behind our figure as he turns into a corridor 
               of slot machines cut to reverse angle from the far end of 
               the corridor as the murky figure approaches a player in

               another player in midground is also in the midst of a payout

               suddenly  with the approach of the figure  both payouts

               bernie limps away from the bar we hear another spike of 
               sound from the gaming area as he approaches a floorman 
               stops him

                                     floorman

               gaming tables takes his time about it his approach brings 
               an illwind to the area the players appear to sense it

               its in their reactions a slight hesitation of the dice

               fingers tensing over a pile of chips a hand tugging at a 
               tie

               the cooler has arrived

               as he reaches table eleven natalie intercepts him with a 
               short glass of chivas regal

               she offers up a smile it jumpstarts those dormant eyes

               her whole face comes alive notches her up from an eight to 
               a ten bernie immediately glances away hes afraid what she 
               might read in his gaze

                                     bernie
                         dont mention it

               bernie gestures her over to table eleven immediately makes 
               the high roller in question a good old boy named bulldog

               hes the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one 
               hand

               bernie grabs the drink from natalies tray intentionally 
               bumps bulldog

                                     bernie

               another man gladly accepts the drink meanwhile bulldog 
               sends the dice high up into the air they drop perfectly on 
               the table the stickman calls it

               the croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table

               bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices

               but hes been noticed all right by natalie not quite sure 
               what shes just witnessed who is this guy

                         that used to have class like a 
                         gorgeous high priced hooker with an 
                         exclusive clientele and then that 
                         steve wynn cocksucker knocks her up 
                         and puts her in a family way

                                     bernie

               ext lucky star motel  night

               bernies 1958 buick electra pulls into the parking lot of a 
               fleabag motel next door to the motel we see a convenience 
               store with the name the ez mark in pink glowing neon its 
               actually supposed to read the ez market but the last two 
               letters of market have burned out

               int lucky star motel  courtyard  night

               one of those center pool style motels a hard luck oasis if 
               ever there was one

               as bernie limps toward his room his neighbor a low rent 
               hooker approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard 
               with a hugeass john in tow

               they converge at their doors at the same time theres a 
               weariness about the hooker thats endemic to this town she 
               winks at bernie he nods at her then casts a furtive glance 
               over at the john the man flips him off the hooker mouths 
               sorry bernie hastily enters his apartment

               int bernies motel room  night

               bernie flips on the light a dim overhead bulb hardly makes 
               a dent in the gloomy surroundings typical drab motel 
               furnishings

               we notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to 
               the window a single place setting on the counter something 
               odd an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor no 
               sign of a cat go figure

               bernie heads over to the dresser a halffilled bottle of 
               gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side

               he pours himself a shot turns on the tv a religious channel 
               shitty reception

               on screen

               an appalachian pentecostal service the members of the 
               congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious 
               hysteria while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits 
               viewer donations

               bernie doesnt even try to change the channel he takes a 
               seat on his bed props himself up against a pair of pillows 
               stretches out

               from next door the sounds of wild humping

                                     hooker os
                         oh yeah baby give it to me oh 
                         yeah thats the spot do it to me 
                         harder you big stud oooooh

               bernie closes his eyes tries to ignore the xrated soundtrack 
               coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls

               the hookers moans are starting to get to him he raises his 
               fist to the wall then stops himself hes just not the 
               confrontational type

               instead he heads over to the tv cranks the volume up the 
               hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with 
               the grunting and groaning from next door making for a bizarre 
               remix that could only exist in the world of bernie lootz 
               bernie emits a deep sigh closes his eyes

               int casino floor  craps tables  night

                         seven and seven

               pinkerton reaches for the drink without taking his eyes off 
               the table he throws a hard six the crowd cheers again

               he turns around stuffs a hundred dollar chip down her shirt 
               and slyly cops a feel

                                     pinkerton
                         thanks dollface

               natalie shudders in disgust she spins around to leave 
               runs smack into bernie spilling her tray of drinks on him

                                     natalie

                         perfectly correct

                                     bernie

                                     natalie
                         i asked around youre a cooler 
                         you turn winners into losers

                                     bernie
                         and do you know how i do that

                                     natalie
                         i know theres stuff that goes on in 
                         casinos all the time 

                                     bernie
                         i do it by being myself people get 
                         next to me and their luck turns 
                         its always been that way

                                     natalie
                         that sounds to me like a self 
                         fulfilling prophecy theres a whole 
                         chapter on that in my course anyways 
                         i can see a big factor in your life 
                         is that youre lacking companionship 
                         theres nobody to deflect off if 
                         youve got as you put it bad karma 
                         then you need someone with good karma 
                         to neutralize it well thats my 
                         take on it anyway

               bernie maintains eye contact with natalie for an extended 
               beat then drops his head gazes at his glass

                                     bernie
                         i dont know about you but im real

               natalie nods bernie motions to stand natalie just remains 
               seated keeps talking

                                     natalie

                              gestures to her drink

                         me yeah im also real tired bernie

                                     bernie

                              hes telling her

                         time

               natalie covers bernies hand with hers

                                     natalie
                         why dont we go back to your place

                                     bernie

                         i dont know if i can afford

               natalie flinches slightly then swiftly regains her composure 
               its vegas an honest mistake

                                     bernie

                         gone and cooled anything not by a 
                         long shot

               int bernies motel room  night

               natalies hand flips on the television another bizarre 
               religious service we pull back from the screen as she tries 
               to change the channel just gets a whole lot of static

               bernies standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room

                                     natalie
                         you should complain about this

                                     bernie

                         nah ive had my fill go ahead

               bernie walks over to the dresser pours himself a shot

               natalie glances around she notices bernies dead plants

                                     natalie
                         you know once theyre dead they 
                         dont really grow back in case 
                         thats what youre waiting for

               her eyes land on the empty cat bowl shes about to say 
               something when she picks up on bernies expression lets 
               not even go there she gestures to an old record player in 
               the corner

                                     natalie
                         so got any music

               bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards bare shelves 
               except for a lone record up on top he brings it down its 
               a sinatra album never been opened

               natalie looks on as bernie meticulously removes the record 
               from its sleeve he blows a few particles of dust from its 
               surface then delicately lays it on the turntable the way 
               he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious with as much 
               care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon

               natalie cant help but smile

               bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record

               everything seems to be going so well until

               skreeeeee! the needle skids across the surface of the record 
               with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard

               bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace and a delicious 
               laugh comes out

               its natalies laugh talk about a tension breaker bernie 
               turns to her shrugs he tries again this time the needle 
               catches and sinatra takes command of the room hes singing 
               this town a finger snapping upbeat valentine to vegas 
               marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch

               natalie summons bernie over with her wagging forefinger he 
               picks up his glass shuffles over

                                     natalie
                         sit relax i promise you at least 
                         one of us has done this before

                                     bernie
                         this is not my first 

                                     natalie
                         sssh surprise me

               she starts massaging his shoulders eliciting involuntary 
               moans from him bernie is almost in tears nobodys touched 
               him like this in years and it shows

               natalie takes bernies glass gulps down the remains herself 
               then sets it on the floor she drops down next to bernie

               starts kissing him takes it slow

                                     natalie
                         youre doing real good

               they fall back onto the mattress natalie taking the reigns 
               maneuvering her hips kicking off her panties

               bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt a pair of 
               dice both twos

               in seconds natalie has separated bernie from his pants and 
               underwear taking him inside of her ol blue eyes keeping 
               the rhythm

               natalie moans uninhibitedly surprise shes a real screamer 
               moments later we hear banging from the hookers side of the 
               wall some john telling them to keep it down

               bernie with tears of elation in his eyes thrusts away at 
               natalie for all of thirty seconds before he explodes 
               convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp

               frank winds down this town a few seconds later poor bernie 
               he didnt even make it through the song

                                     bernie
                         sorry

               natalie wraps her arms around him

                                     natalie
                         dont worry bernie ive had worse 
                         well try again later

               bernie rests his head on her breasts closes his eyes we 
               hold on him a few seconds pass and he breaks into a smile

               fade to black

               int bernies motel room  day

               tight on bernie sleeping he still has that goofy smile on 
               his lips a beat or two later he opens his eyes we pull 
               back to reveal that hes alone in the bed no sign of natalie

               bernie turns to the pillow next to him buries his face in 
               it takes a deep breath moans at her scent ambrosia he 
               still has his face in the pillow sucking in deep breaths 
               when natalie steps out of the bathroom big smile

                                     natalie
                         hey so you wanna get some breakfast

               bernie just looks up at her replay on the goofy smile

               heaven

                                     bernie vo

               shelly is close to losing it when morrie the manager of 
               the paradise comes running up

               shelly larry and bernie following behind morrie as he hastily 
               leads them down a hallway of the shangrilas best suites 
               they arrive at an open door the sound of a television 
               beckoning them inside

               int buddy staffords suite  night

               starting on the tv set lost horizon 1937 is playing

               its the scene where robert conway ronald coleman his 
               brother and maria are leaving the lost city in the end

               conway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise

               panning off the screen to a pair of naked feet on the floor 
               next to the bed revealing buddy slumped against the side 
               of the mattress a hypodermic needle protruding from his 
               arm death glaze fixated on the screen

               bernie slumps back against the wall catches his breath

               shelly just stares at buddy a slight tremor of grief 
               threatening his granite features he glances over at larry 
               who takes in buddys deathly repose without a hint of emotion 
               larry meets shellys eye with a subtle smirk of oneupmanship

               an incendiary beat passes between them then

                                     shelly

               into the theater

               our eye drawn to the stage a troupe of gorgeous female 
               dancers in leopard print gstrings grinding their hips to 
               the muscular rhythm

               flanking them are a pair of strutting lions in elevated cages

               an explosion of light and smoke and johnny cappella makes 
               his entrance decked out in a reflective suit that picks up 
               every light in the house and throws it back at the audience

               johnnys got the style of a harry connick jr and the moves 
               of ricki martin the energy this guy brings to the stage 
               makes the last twenty years of buddy staffords reign seem 
               like suspended animation the women in the audience start 
               fanning themselves with delight

               its a new dawn in paradise and the panties are coming fast 
               and furious

               we see shelly watching from the back of the room he shifts 
               his attention to nicky larry and marty at a primo table

               sucker she decides against it

                         used to work coney island during the 
                         summer when a guy would walk up and 
                         seemed eager to open his wallet we 
                         would always mark him with chalk 
                         wed pat him on the back or arm with 
                         the chalk like hey buddy good

               she brushes it for effect bernie smiles they take a seat 
               at the end of the midway

               natalie locks onto a little toeheaded boy being dragged 
               around by his older brother and the brothers friend the 
               kid has a glazed look in his eyes

               natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression bernie 
               picks up on it

                                     bernie

               natalie hides her face behind her soda cup looks off in the 
               distance

               she tears her eyes away from bernie bernie cant believe 
               what hes hearing that she wants to be invested in him

                         i gave my son up for adoption i 
                         just wanted my life back i was 
                         seventeen going on eighteen and i 
                         was selfish my family they didnt 
                         want to have nothing to do with me 
                         after that so i hitched a ride out

                         when i was older  with some guy i 
                         cared about  maybe things would

               nicky claps his hands dealer style  for effect  and with 
               a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table nickys chips 
               are quickly swept up by the croupier

               the table

               at security the suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful 
               of comps and a bruised ego shelly takes nicky aside attempts 
               to calm him nicky keeps railing at shelly

               theres an unspoken understanding between them the good 
               old days we see bernie in the bg looking more than a 
               bit shocked

               int the makawao bar and grill  night

               bernie seated with natalie

                         chart for the two of us and it looks 
                         good really it does

                                     bernie

                                     natalie

               bernies expression oh

                                     natalie
                         maybe i was being presumptuous cause 
                         i knew you were leaving and i 
                         tried working it in different ways 
                         it wasnt good bernie i got scared 
                         but thats just for now for the 
                         immediate future once the planets 
                         realign maybe a year from now

                                     bernie
                         natalie i cant not another 
                         year not another week

               a somber mood falls on the table bernie reaches for natalies 
               hand instead he knocks the salt over it spills out in 
               front of them

                                     bernie
                         i think we probably shouldnt see 
                         each other anymore

                                     natalie
                         why bernie we only got a couple 
                         days left together why not make the 
                         most of them

                                     bernie
                              a long beat
                         because if i spend one more night in 
                         your arms im not going anywhere

                                     natalie
                         and thats so bad

               bernie just stares at her shrouded in sadness natalie stubs 
               out her cigarette rises

                                     natalie
                         take care bernie

               bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front 
               of him nods a few beats later he raises his head

                                     bernie
                         natalie dont

                         i think you better bring me the 
                         bottle please

               int shangrila hotel and casino/bar  night

               once again we see bernies feet limp across the casino floor 
               he walks up to the bar asks for a cup of coffee

               doris brings it over short on the cream again

               he just sips it black gloom and doom features life sucks

               his masters voice sounds over the intercom

                                     voice vo
                         chang party of fifteen your table 
                         is ready chang party of fifteen

               bernie looks to doris sighs only three more days

               int casino floor  craps tables  night

               he heads for the crap tables the sound of raucous cheering 
               becomes audible a large crowd starting to gather

               bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd as soon as 
               he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table he tenses 
               up

               oh shit

               its mikey with charlene charlene is making one hell of a 
               racket playing up her extremely maternal state

               just then natalie sidles up to bernie with the chivas regal

               without thinking about it he grabs the glass off the tray 
               downs it in a single gulp

                                     charlene
                              clutching her tummy
                         come on mikey this is our future 
                         dont blow it

               mikey throws down a bet for the dealer

                                     mikey
                         put this on the line for the boys

               the stickman thanks him as they place the bet mikey throws 
               down more money we can see mikey has bets all over the table

                                     mikey
                         with shoes!

                                     stickman
                         dealers got shoes hands high the 
                         dice are out! the point is nine

                                     charlene
                         come on all yous put a good thought 
                         in for our baby!

               as everyone dotes over charlene mikey quickly swaps the 
               dice before anyone can see he throws

                                     stickman
                         six the hard way!

               mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier as is charlene

               bernie stands frozen he doesnt bother trying to get any 
               closer to the table he knows itll do no good

                                     charlene
                         oh my god i just felt him kick! he 
                         knows he knows youre all pulling 
                         for him god bless you all

               natalie looks over at charlene their eyes meet for a second 
               its as though natalie knows its a scam and charlenes 
               acknowledging it

               mikey throws again

                                     stickman
                         six the hard way! look out we got a 
                         shooter!

               another nine grand mikeys rail is nearly full charlene 
               hops around awkwardly causing more distraction

               bernie is really sweating it out now then shelly arrives

               larry is hot on his tail

                                     shelly
                         how much

                                     bernie

               bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming 
               in through the blinds huh this is a first for him hes 
               never gotten direct sunlight in his room before whats the 
               deal did the world just turn on its axis

               impression in the sheets and a note on her pillow for a 
               moment his heart stops he conjures up the worst grabs up 
               the note unfolds it

               we see a lipstick kiss and the words have a spectacular 
               day!

               bernie lets out a joyful whoop! leaps out of bed

               love makes the world go around it obviously also gives life 
               to dead plants as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung 
               up overnight above his radiator but we wont dwell on that

               int shangrila hotel and casino  day

               bernie struts into the casino a changed man still to the 
               tune of luck be a lady even his limp seems less pronounced 
               as he greets fellow workers as they pass

               he catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror maybe for 
               the first time he likes what he sees in the reflection he 
               notices natalie smiling at him he meets her eyes she averts

                         look for the first time here was 
                         someone who wasnt trying to hustle 
                         me wasnt pretending to be somebody 
                         he wasnt just a decent guy trying 
                         to get back on track and it didnt 
                         hurt any that you put me up on a 
                         pedestal it sure puts the gutter 
                         into perspective

                                     bernie

               the sight of her just breaks bernies heart he stands slowly 
               legs like jelly  and in that instant its all so clear to 
               him he walks over forgiveness in his eyes contrition in 
               hers

               she tries to say something he shakes his head
