          helicopter rise up in the distance

          pritchett

          other pilot
          deakins shakes his head

          pritchett
          then how come the helicopter
          crashed

          deakins
          a flicker of worry
          pilot error
          deakins turns and walks away over to

          nuke they are loading them into the back of one humvee

          pritchett

          be here

          deakins
          mr pritchett i understand your
          concerns you and your associates
          gave me a lot of money to mount
          this operation but theyre
          getting ten times that back if we
          succeed

          pritchett
          if we succeed

          deakins
          all i can do is my part weve
          got the weapons were 
          checks watch
           seventeen minutes ahead of
          schedule and everything will be in
          place within two hours but i
          cant guarantee that the assholes
          in washington wont do something
          stupid like not pay

          pritchett
          what if they dont

          deakins
          then the next census for this
          region is going to show a very
          sudden drop in population

          giles enters and is brought over to wilkins

          giles
          colonel wilkins im giles

          they shake hands
          my word from your search and
          rescue team

          wilkins
          no

          

          

          

          

           38

          giles

          radiation
          wilkins shakes his head

          giles
          thats kind of strange  if
          theres an exposed core out there

          wilkins
          point

          giles
          probably nothing i asked for a
          transcript of the last cockpit
          transmission
          wilkins nods to a corporal who hands some papers to giles giles
          reads them quickly

          wilkins
          i dont know what you expect to
          find

          cu transcripts
          we see colonel deakins this is deakins! hale lost it! oh
          god! i have to punch out!

          giles
          you know these guys the pilots

          wilkins
          just on the radio never met em
          why

          giles
          looks up
          what if this wasnt pilot error

          int pentagon situation room

          baird has put giles on speaker phone the people in the
          situation room exchange looks

          baird
          no rhetorical questions giles
          spit it out

          

          

          

          

           39

          crosscut with giles in mcmurran control room

          giles
          in the last transmission from the
          plane colonel deakins said major
          hale lost it and made the plane
          crash we all assumed that meant
          pilot error but what if deakins
          meant hale made the plane crash
          murmurs of thats insane no way fill the room

          baird
          why would he do that

          giles
          two nuclear weapons would be worth
          a hell of a lot of money

          chairman
          to whom son there are easier
          ways for someone to buy nuclear
          weapons you go to one of the old
          soviet republics you can get one
          for the price of a bmw

          giles
          i meant theyd be worth a lot of
          money to us how much would we
          pay to get them back to make
          sure they werent used in this
          country
          a flurry of looks around the room

          baird
          hold on hold on
          to creeley
          these nukes have codes or
          something that prevent people from
          using them

          creeley
          of course

          baird
          no one has these codes  outside
          of the president and you guys

          creeley
          access to the codes requires the
          highest security 

          baird
          i mean not even the pilots have
          these codes right

          

          

          

          

           40
          creeley starts to stammer baird slumps the chairman turns

          chairman
          to an assistant
          wheres that nest team now

          giles

          think nest or the satellite will
          find anything weird

          wilkins

          high cliff suddenly from off the cliff

          hale and terry

          finds what he is looking for  a jerry can of gasoline and an
          emergency tool box

          in the second humvee

          deakins

          genuinely impressed

          hale
          we need somewhere to hide

          terry

          thinks
          i know a place

          ext 4wd trail

          deakins keeps spraying the burning humvee with foam

          ext mine entrance

          terry and hale have taken the humvee to the parking area in
          front of an abandoned mine the winch on the humvee strains
          the cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
          doors the doors are slowly pulling out groaning

          terry
          it was a copper mine barely
          squeaking along for years they
          shut itdown a few months ago when
          they hit an underground river
          the hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
          loose hale shuts down the winch unhooks it from the doors
          he motions for terry to drive it in

          int mineshaft entrance

          terry drives the humvee into the mineshaft entrance hale uses
          a flashlight to look around he finds a switch a flips it a
          gas generator comes to life another click and lights come on
          now they can see the rest of the entry area including a wire
          meshenclosed elevator as terry looks around hale grabs the
          humvee radio tries to tune in other frequencies gives up

          hale
          they hardwired in their frequency

          reason for being here
          hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
          panel on the side of one of the b83s

          hale
          these nukes have security codes
          if you enter the wrong code three
          times the nuke goes dead  all
          the circuitry shorts out and shuts
          down kind of like the security
          systems with car radios

          terry
          and people say the public doesnt
          benefit from defense spending

          hale

          in one hand hale holds terrys sock filled with sand his
          other hand grips the eyebolt terry is giving hale a log up
          straining under the weight

          terry
          take your time really
          hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt he
          tightens a belt around the open end of the sock

          hale
          okay
          terry lets hale down hale picks up a big rock and loops the
          free end of the belt around it then he picks up a smaller rock

          close on nuclear weapon
          one chip has been pulled out of a circuit board hale very
          gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip

          hale
          we make a small hole in the sock
          and when enough sand drains out 
          and were hopefully in new
          mexico  the sock is pulled
          through the eyebolt the rock
          drops
          re smaller rock
           hitting the rock on this chip
          closing the firing circuit and
          thats it
          hale finishes putting the small rock in position he stands

          terry
          how much time are we going to have

          hale
          i dont know precisely this
          isnt a swiss sock ten minutes
          maybe 
          hale is cut off by

          bullets
          flying in ricocheting off the rock walls fired by

          johnson
          thirty yards down the tunnel

          one of johnsons bullets cuts through it

          hale
          feels sand hitting his face looks up

          his pov
          sand is draining out of the sock very fast

          hale and terry
          reaches up to grab the big rock but johnson sends a spray of
          bullets in terry grabs hale

          terry
          come on!

          hale
          the sock 
          more bullets terry pulls hale they run down a side passage
          hale and terry fire back at johnson as they run out of sight

          johnson
          shoots after them then runs up to the weapon he reaches for
          the rock stops  maybe thatll set it off

          the sock
          the last sand pours out the sock is sucked through the eyebolt

          the rock
          drops fast toward the nuke

          a hand
          grabs it stopping it just in time the hand belongs to

          deakins
          he looks at johnson in disgust exhales and tosses the rock he
          pulls out a walkietalkie clicks on talks into it

          terry nods they hurry off around a corner and are met by

          a flurry of bullets
          fired by

          deakins
          with his uzi

          hale and terry
          run back down the side tunnel bullets winging off the rock all
          around them shooting back hale starts shooting out the
          lights plunging the tunnel into darkness

          deakins
          slows down

          these puppies im ready willing
          and able hell im eager
          deakins jams in his clip walks into the dark part of the tunnel

          hale and terry
          in the dark waiting to ambush deakins and then

          deakins
          opens fire  but not at hale and terry  at the cable along
          the ceiling connecting the lights the cable snaps and
          electrical sparks shoot out flooding the tunnel with light
          showing

          hale and terry
          suddenly exposed to deakins fire the bullets whiz in

          deakins
          the muzzle flashes from his uzi give away his position and hale
          and terrys bullets scream in at him he backs around a corner

          hale and terry
          take cover its a standoff

          deakins
          well hale i better be going

          you wanted to get closer to god

          city arent you
          the footsteps stop

          near the radiology department so
          they wont show up an any
          satellite radiation scans

          deakins
          im impressed

          hale

          deakins
          enough ive got a broker in

          hale
          thats the thing  i wouldnt

          deakins

          truth youre both just fucked in
          the head

          bunched on the bottom of the raft she drops

          with deakins and sheppard
          coming down a path lugging the last remaining nuke

          their pov
          of the raft hale and terry are nowhere to be seen

          

          

          

          

           73

          hale
          is alone in the water on the far side of the raft very
          silent he hears deakins and sheppard load the nuke into the
          raft

          sheppard os
          why were you driving around with
          a dead guy

          deakins os
          because i like him he doesnt
          ask a lot of annoying questions
          all right
          a few seconds later the engine starts up hale ducks down under
          water as the raft takes off over him he surfaces to watch the
          raft zooming off into the distance he is very worried

          on the raft  moving
          the nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft sheppard
          pilots the raft deakins looks around sees what he wants

          a tarp
          is lying on the deck of the raft along one side all bunched up
          itd be the kind of thing youd hide under

          deakins
          grabs the tarp and pulls

          under the tarp
          theres no one there

          deakins
          throws the tarp over the nuke as he does we pan over to

          a long crate marked life jackets
          strapped to one of the side pontoons a small triangle of cloth
          is sticking out from inside the crate  like the corner of a
          shirt its quickly pulled out of sight from within

          back on the riverbank
          hale climbs out of the water and looks around not knowing quite
          what to do

          window and the map on his lap

          wilkins
          i dont know what youre looking
          for major every road between
