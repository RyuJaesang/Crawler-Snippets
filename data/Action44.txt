ext gas station  day

as jeff continues pouring the oil he doesnt notice the
mudstreaked dodge ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
behind him the driver earl climbs out the other man
remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up

earl is a beefy man about jeffs age he wears a sweat
stained western hat cowboy boots and a tshirt with the
sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps he
saunters over to the cherokee stands there a beat
looking over jeffs shoulder

jeff senses something behind him turns his eyes widen
as he sees earl recognizes the pickup as the one he
nearly hit a few minutes before earl stares at him
unsmiling

                         earl
                  flatly
           nice car

jeff is in an awkward position hes got a halffull
upsidedown bottle of oil in his hands if he lifts it
now hell spill on the engine he turns his gaze back
to the engine decides to keep pouring

                         jeff
           thanks

earl steps around to the open passenger window peers in
jeff watches him wary

                                           continued

the oil bottle empties    out relieved jeff pulls it away
and screws back on the    crankcase cap he shuts the hood
with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to
remove the gas nozzle    from the tank earl blocks his
path

                           earl
             course if you use a cb you
             gotta have a handle

looking past earl jeff sees amy come out of the mini

anxious to avoid a confrontation

has not moved during the scene he looks back at the
minimart

then 80 then 85

                           amy
             this isnt the grand prix you

jeff releases his foot from the accelerator     the needle
sinks back down to 65

she gives him a long contemplative look

                         jeff

jeff drives in silence amy stares out the window
bored looking for a distraction she picks up a
cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label

                                              continued

                            jeff
          what the hell

the car gives another jolt

                        amy

brakes and steering lose power the engine quits cold

                        jeff
          hang on  i cant steer!

the car bucks and screeches after a few hiccups it
jerks to a halt just beyond a crest in the road

for a moment they sit there dazed staring ahead at the
empty road then amy notices an object on the floor 
the nikon she picks it up

                        amy
                 deadpan

he rolls his eyes   he yanks the hood release and gets
out


ext highway  day

steam pours from under the    hood of the cherokee amy
gets out and looks around    at the scorched wasteland
jeff goes to the front of    the car gropes under the hood
for the release latch he     yanks his hand away burned by
the hot metal

                         jeff

                                              continued

                        jeff
                 annoyed
          i said im fine okay

jeff lifts the hood examines the engine he tugs on a
cable checks the battery connection and radiator

he goes to the passengers side and takes a handheld
cellular phone from the glove box he dials zero and
hits send the phone beeps

                             amy
          out of range

jeff grunts tosses the phone on the seat it bounces
and lands on the floor amy watches as he returns to the
engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap

                        amy

approaching fast on the road as it streaks past earl
yells and launches a beer bottle from the window the
bottle shatters on the asphalt

                           amy

                     the road
          jeff 

a quartermile away the pickup is slowing it pulls a
uturn and stops facing the cherokee it just sits
there engine idling

                           jeff

jeff watches the pickup frowning then from the
opposite direction they hear a low rumble they turn
and stare at 

                                                         20

massive tractortrailer

coming over a crest in the road

its a huge eighteenwheeler a white 1988 peterbilt
it grinds into low gear and slows brakes creaking

the truck comes to a halt with a hiss of compressed air


down highway

the pickup starts up again it pulls another uturn and
drives away melting into the desert


amy

breathes a sigh of relief

the driver dismounts from the cab leaving the engine
idling we recognize him as the trucker in the mini
mart he removes his cap revealing a shock of
prematurely white hair he is wellshaven his clothes
immaculate his name is red

                        red trucker
          you folks all right

                         jeff

                        jeff
          thanks id appreciate it    amy
          you want to steer

amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral
jeff and red push the car to the shoulder as they push
jeff glances at the cb antenna on reds cab

                        jeff
          think you could radio a tow truck
          for us

                       red
         i sure would if i could mister
         but my cb blew a fuse this
         morning im waiting till i hit
         the truck stop on i40 to get it
         fixed

                     disappointed
             oh

red walks around to the front of the car and peers down
at the exposed engine

                        red
          id offer to take a look but its
          hard to say with these new
          engines used to be you could
          give em a kick and a holler and
          theyd start right up now its
          all computers and chips

                        jeff
          its a new car

                        red
          that could be the problem you
          been running it pretty fast

amy gives jeff a reprimanding look     its subtle but red
notices

                        red
          tell you what if you want a
          ride theres a little diner up
          the road belles they got a
          pay phone you could call a tow
          truck from there

jeff considers this glances back to where the dodge ram
was last seen

                            jeff
          nice     of you to offer but weve
          got a     lot of stuff in the car i
          think     were better off waiting for
          a cop     to come along

amy rolls her eyes red sees the look trying not to
smile he glances up at a small plane flying overhead

                                              continued

             this    road thats why the truckers
             use    it maybe youll get lucky
                       tipping his cap
             good    luck

he turns and heads back toward his truck amy looks at

from his face he looks down the highway

nothing in sight extremely bored he wanders over to
the raised hood and studies the engine again

after a few moments something catches his eye curious
he kneels down and peers under the chassis he frowns


jeffs pov  loose wire

dangling under the engine

he pulls his swiss army knife  from his pocket and slides
under the car working with   the screwdriver blade of the
knife he reconnects the plug  to its socket in the
process his hands and shirt  become stained with grease

jeff slides out from under the car brushes himself off
and gets behind the wheel he tosses the swiss army
knife on the center console and keys the ignition the
engine roars to life

int belles  day

dark and dingy formica tables a bar chunky customers
in kmart clothes sit at the bar nursing beers and
watching a football game on a big muted tv

jeff enters and all conversation stops the other
patrons turn and stare after a moment they return to
their beers

jeff glances around   no sign of amy   no sign of red

a boredlooking bartender stands behind the counter
preparing a sandwich behind him a blackboard menu
jeff approaches

                         jeff
          excuse me

the bartender looks up a cutting knife in his hand

                        jeff
          i was supposed to meet my wife
          here

the bartender shrugs gives him a look    yeah so

          five wearing a pale blue

         a trucker

                        bartender

                                            continued

             guy with a baseball cap   driving
             an eighteen wheeler

the bartender thinks a moment shakes his head

                           bartender
             dont ring a bell

                           jeff
             you sure

the bartender leans over the counter calls out

                           bartender
             hey! man heres looking for his
             wife dark hair buttonon shirt
             travelin with a guy in a baseball
             cap anybody see em

jeff looks up and down the counter blank faces a few
disinterested shrugs a few headshakes no

a disheveled female barfly flo grins up at him

                           flo
             looks like she got away from ya
             cowboy

a few of the regulars chuckle at this     jeff ignores
them turns back to the bartender

                           jeff
             could she have left a message with
             another one of your employees

                        bartender
          dont see how im the only one
          who works here

jeff scratches his head    this doesnt make any sense

                        jeff
          i dont understand is there
          another belles diner

                        bartender
                 chuckles
          no siree definitely not

jeff clenches his jaw takes another look around      an
elderly couple sit at a rear table watching him      they
whisper to each other

                                                continued

                            jeff
                     under his breath
             shit

he turns and goes outside


ext belles  day

jeff squints in the bright sunlight

maybe he got this place confused with a different diner
he peers up at the sign it says belles all right

he walks to the phone booth looks inside   the phone
book is missing

he picks up the receiver listens for the dial tone
phone works okay he hangs up

he stands there for a moment scanning the horizon in all
directions there is nothing else out here nowhere else
she could have gone

jeff marches back into the diner


int diner  day

jeff goes to the bartender

                        jeff

          town

                        bartender
          about twenty miles

                     shrugs bored
             okay

jeff regards the bartender skeptically    he takes one
last look around then heads out

                                                        28

but the truck does not slow down

truck to pull over but the peterbilt maintains its
speed

jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver

             mister i never seen you before in
             my life

suddenly there is a loud squawk from inside the cab 
the cb radio

just a precaution

ext rear of peterbilt  day

jeff and the sheriff observe as red unlatches two heavy
padlocks grunting he raises the slatted metal door
it retracts along the ceiling with a noisy rattle


inside

the cavernous interior is mostly empty except for a few
randomly strewn cardboard boxes too small to contain a
person

                       sheriff boyd
                 re boxes

          activity no sign of struggle

helpful

                        red
          look i dont mean to butt in but
          maybe you got my truck confused
          with someone elses

          from there or im going to have to

red climbs into the cab jeff watches helplessly
resigned to the fact theres nothing more he can do        the
sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio        as
the truck drives off jeff goes over to the cruiser

                        sheriff boyd
          sir i believe you that your wife

he hands jeff a card with an address printed on it

jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in    the sheriff
softens his tone sympathetic

                        sheriff boyd
          if you want my opinion your wife
          is probably around here lost or
          plenty pissed off and giving you a
          scare either way shell turn
          up

as jeff stares at the sheriff the police radio squawks

             sheriff arthur boyd 22693

int police station  day

a wall is covered with missing persons notices
photographs of men women and children stare back at us
names and dates are printed across the bottom of the
notices

pull back to reveal jeff staring at the gallery of faces
its a creepy feeling several yards away deputy len
carver a young puffyfaced lawman sits at a desk
filling out a form jeff looks shaken

                        deputy carver
          is this a recent picture

jeff glances over deputy carver is holding up a wallet
sized photograph of amy

                        jeff
          two months old

                        deputy carver

the deputy resumes filling out the form   he clicks his
tongue sympathetically

                        deputy carver
          well certainly do our best mr
          taylor theres over a hundred
          thousand people go missing in this
          country every year runaways
          deadbeat dads dropouts folks
          hiding from the irs  all
          vanishing without a trace

jeff stares at the faces

                        deputy carver
          now im not saying shes one of
          them i sure hope not but
          unless theres a ransom demand or
          evidence of forced abduction
          believe me the fbi wont even
          look at your case till its been
          24 hours

deputy carver finishes the paperwork and staples the
photograph to the form he looks up at jeff

                        deputy carver
          nevertheless well sure keep our
          eyes peeled hows that sound

jeff clenches his jaw

the cherokee pulls up to the side of the building   jeff
gets out and walks inside


int belles diner  day

jeff enters looks around its the same scene as
before same bartender a slightly different cast of
characters

no sign of amy

jeff advances to the bartender who stands at a sink
rinsing beer mugs

                           jeff
             did she come in

                           bartender
                    looks up uninterested
             didnt see her

                        jeff
          you didnt see her or she didnt
          come in

                        bartender
          buddy i told you the last time
          im busy maybe she came in
          maybe she didnt all i know is
          i didnt see her

jeff looks around not particularly trusting the
bartenders skills of observation he grinds his jaw

the other customers at the bar have been watching all
this one of them an older grizzled barfly looks up at
jeff

                        barfly
                 confidentially
          none of my business mister but
          if i was you id take a look in
          the ladies room

the barfly gives jeff a wink and turns back to his beer
snickers from some of his bar mates who avert their eyes
when jeff glances at them jeff knows this is almost
certainly a puton but he cant take a chance

while the barflies watch pokerfaced jeff walks to the
door of the ladies room hesitates then knocks his
knock is answered by a wordless sound halfgroan half
gasp

                          jeff
          amy

silence jeff tries the door its locked he rattles
it another groan jeff puts his shoulder against the
door heaves inward the door swings open revealing

inside bathroom

flo bent over the toilet vomiting she whirls around
a strand of spittle dangling from her lip

                        flo
          hey  what the hell you doing!

jeff backs away yanks the door shut   the barflies
chuckle among themselves

jeff strides angrily for the exit he stops at the door
takes one last look around no one seems to be paying
him much attention he turns to leave

 but something stops him he cant put his finger on
it theres something wrong here

he stares at the other customers why do they avoid eye
contact are they hiding something

he scrutinizes more closely

there is the gruff trucker sitting at a nearby table
shoveling food in his mouth hes been averting his gaze
ever since jeff walked in

and then theres the traveling salesman overweight
sweaty popping vitamins along with his coffee

or what about the shirtless biker reading a comic book
at the bar probably an excon

while jeff is running these suspicions through his mind
a trucker approaches the counter to place an order the
bartender jots it down on a pad then tears off the
carbon slip he places one copy above the grill and
another in a pile by the cash register

jeff stares an idea forming

he approaches the bar

                        jeff
          i want to see your order slips

                         bartender
          what

                        jeff
          you write down the names   i want
          to see them

                       bartender
         what are you nuts i dont have
         to show you jack shit

                                             continued

jeff leans in his face

                           jeff
             if my wife came in here then her
             names in that pile

the bartender stiffens stares him straight in the eye

                        bartender
          you calling me a liar

a tense beat

possessed by a sudden impulse jeff makes a grab for the
receipts before he can reach them the bartenders hand
clamps onto his

                        bartender
          mister ive had just about enough
          of you

                        jeff
          let me see the fucking slips

in one swift motion jeff overpowers the man and extracts
the receipts he starts going through them fast
looking at names tully mark flo andy and

jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a
smith & wesson revolver

                        bartender
          now mister youre going to have
          to leave

jeff takes a step back everyone in the diner is
staring he stumbles backwards heads for the exit


ext belles diner  day

jeff exits breathing hard and runs to the phone booth

frame illfitting clothes jeff raps on the glass
anxiously

                        jeff

the man looks up dull and glassyeyed his sluggish
demeanor suggests mental retardation he hangs up and
slowly opens the door

him back jeff senses this

          anything tell me

                       billy
          oh man never shoulda opened my
          damn mouth now im gonna git it

billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot
jeff hurries after him and catches up cornering billy
between two cars trying to calm him

                        jeff
          no ones going to hurt you billy
          just tell me what you saw

billy glances around nervously swallowing

          white one

          yes im still here       no  dont
          call back  steve!       steve!

the signal cuts off    jeff slams the phone against the
dash furious

                          jeff
          goddammit!

he punches redial gets the no service beeping then
glances up sees a 


chainlink fence

covered with highvisibility markers stretched across the
road the sign road closed


back to jeff

he mashes the brakes the cherokee skids to a halt just
short of the fence jeff stares at it

                                                continued

                                                      48

continued

                         jeff
             shit!

he grinds his teeth beyond the padlocked gate the
highway continues as an unpaved dirt road

he deliberates then throws the cherokee in reverse and
does a threepoint turn so hes facing back in the
opposite direction

he looks up sees 


dodge ram pickup truck

has been hiding in the bushes off the road it lurches
forward and stops in the middle of the road blocking
jeffs escape jeffs eyes widen in fear as he
recognizes the vehicle and its driver earl

earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle   he raises
it to his shoulder

                         earl
                  calling out
           out of the car! put your hands
           where i can see em!


jeff

swears panicking

                         earl
           i said get out dammit!   now!

jeff stares into the rifle deliberating   his hand moves
to the gearshift

he jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!


cherokee

peels out in reverse snaking wildly side to side aiming
for the chainlink fence

it bursts the fence!   poles and chain mesh go flying!


jeff

cranks the wheel and brakes hard the rear end of the
cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road

he throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle

                                                        49

earl

jumps in the ram and takes off in pursuit


jeff

guns the engine the cherokee bounces wildly on the
rutted stormdamaged road he yanks the fourwheel
drive lever


dirt road

the huge pickup streaks after the cherokee its 75liter
v10 roaring oversized tires devouring the terrain


jeff

guns the engine on the washboard road surface the
vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while 


ram

keeps pace in the dust from its wake inside the cab
earl can be seen speaking on a cb transmitter


jeff

throws the cherokee into a sharp turn in the road as
the car rounds the bend he looks up reacting as 


idled bulldozer

blocks the road at a construction site more unattended
earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond


jeff

brakes wildly to his right a cliff goes straight up
on the left a guardrail protects a steep ravine

he cuts the wheel left crashes through the guardrail and
plunges into the ravine!


cherokee

bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope crashing
through sagebrush and manzanita

                                                        50

jeff

clings to the wheel tossed about violently as suitcases
and packing boxes go everywhere

the cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and crashes
through the upper branches of a willow grove

as the leaves part we see a river


cherokee

lands on the passenger side with a splash and comes to
rest halfsubmerged in the rushing water


earl

jerks the ram to a halt leaps out and runs to the edge
of the road to look down on the cherokee in the river

                             earl
            sonofabitch

he grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the
slope


inside cherokee

the world is sideways water rushes into the car jeff
is strapped into the drivers seat by the seatbelt the
airbag deflates with a hiss

jeff grimaces in pain he looks around blinking   the
river is flowing right through the cherokee!

luggage styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty coke
cans bob on the surface of the water

jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release the belt comes
free and he drops suddenly into the water on the
passenger side

he gets to his feet reaches overhead to unlatch the
drivers side door and pushes it open

he hoists himself through the door


riverbank

earl sees jeff emerging from the halfsubmerged cherokee
levels the rifle and fires!

                                                      51

jeff

ducks back inside the cherokee freaking

the passenger side is on the riverbottom and if he tries
to get out through the drivers side hes a sitting
duck!

jeff swears and looks around seeing a metal camera case
underwater in the back seat

he grabs the case and swings it at the windshield   the
first three blows bounce off harmlessly

then the windshield shatters with a crash!

he takes a deep breath submerges and swims underwater
through the broken windshield


on bank

earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water several
items of debris from the car are floating on the current

                            earl
             fuck!

he begins moving downstream along the bank eyeing the
river


underwater

jeff breaststrokes for all hes worth sand swirls in
the swift current he pushes away from a boulder in his
path

he swims until his lungs are bursting then surfaces for
air


on bank

earl sees jeff break the surface he aims the rifle and
fires! a bullet smacks the water near jeffs head

then jeff is under again

                            earl
             goddammit


underwater

jeff struggles to stay in control the current is
turning swifter his shoulder glances painfully off a
boulder

                                                        52

on bank

earl works his way through the brush at the rivers edge
his foot lands between two rocks he pulls it out
swearing


behind rock

jeff surfaces and gulps in air staying out of sight of
earl on the bank then he is down again


on bank

earl works his way along the shore up ahead the river
runs over rapids before passing around a bend

earl hears an engine and turns a huge moving van has
arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine

he shouts to the driver pointing downriver

                          earl
            hes getting away!

the driver shouts something inaudible earl runs along
the bank ducking under lowhanging branches


in rapids

jeff is carried over the rocks by the fastmoving
current he slams into a boulder letting out a cry and
swallowing a mouthful of water

a downed tree hangs over the river jeff grabs
desperately and takes hold of a branch hes got it!

hanging on to the branch he notices a familiar object
floating past in the water the 90000 donuts pack

jeff tries to haul himself from the river the branch
bends under his weight then it comes free with a crack!

jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water


on bank

earl works his way along the shore    the unseen driver of
the van shouts to him from upriver

                           driver of van os
            where is he

                                              continued

                                                         53

continued

                           earl
             hes in the water!   i just saw
             him!


below rapids

the river has turned slow again

jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to
the bank he drops to his knees retching

clutching his ribs he raises his head and looks upriver
for the moment there is no sign of earl but he could
appear anytime

jeff gets to his feet wincing he looks up at the rocky
canyon wall bordering the river its steep but
scalable

he begins climbing

                                               dissolve to


ext rock outcropping  minutes later

jeff has climbed to higher ground he lies flat on his
belly and peers through a gap in the rocks at the river
valley below


jeffs pov  river

the men have given up their pursuit

the moving van a jumbo threeaxle gmc has turned around
and backed up to the edge of the ravine

a stocky man al whom we recognize as earls passenger
at the minimart operates a gaspowered winch in the
cargo door of the van

a cable runs from the winch down to the cherokee in the
river

standing kneedeep in the current earl signals to al
while the winch slowly tugs the cherokee onto its wheels
then backwards out of the river

                                                        54

back to jeff

watching in amazement   he can hear only snatches of
their conversation

                        al
           cant believe you let him get
          away

                        earl
          you try chasing through this
          shit

                        al
          fuck this is what happens when
          you get one without the other

jeff cant believe it the cherokee is being pulled
backwards up the slope toward the road

he bellycrawls back from the outcropping gets to his
feet and climbs higher

                                              cut to


ext another part of cliff  later

jeff has moved to higher ground he crouches behind a
stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below


jeffs pov  road

the cherokee is now back on the road

operating the winch with precision efficiency earl and
al drag the cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the
moving van

once the vehicle is aboard they stow the ramp and close
the van doors


back to jeff

watching in amazement straining to hear what earl and al
are saying behind jeff a pebble skitters on the rock

he turns reacts

its billy  the halfwit from the diner! wielding a
shotgun like a club he swings the butt at jeffs skull!

jeff drops to the ground unconscious

                                            cut to black

                                                     55

fade in

int car trunk  day

there is a creak as the trunk opens jeff lies inside
dazed and disoriented blinking into the sun his eyes
wont focus earl and billy stand over the trunk in
silhouette he can hear their voices

                         earl

jeff blinks a face slowly comes into focus is it

                         billy
           cmon shake a leg

                        jeff

          accounts the balance

billy nods disappointed

                        billy
          yeah i suppose too bad
                 peers down at jeff

          after all
                 to earl
          waste of time plug him

earl raises a pistol   jeffs eyes flash

                        jeff
                 blurting out
          ninety thousand

earl stops glances at billy   they both eye jeff
carefully

                        billy
          say again

                        jeff
                 emphatic
          ninety thousand dollars

a faint smile plays on billys lips     he slams the trunk


int car trunk  day

its nearly pitch black a beam of sunlight shines
through a rusted hole it illuminates jeffs eyes

                                             continued

                                                          57

continued

the car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert
jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain

he braces against the confines of the trunk the engine
noise is deafening the car hits a depression and
jounces wildly jeff is thrown about violently

                                                cut to


ext mesa overlook  day

there is a creak and the trunk opens jeff squints into
the sun earl and billy stand over the trunk

                            earl
             get out   dont try anything
             stupid

jeff gets out grimacing     his clothes are stained with
grease and tire grime he     sets his feet unsteadily on
the ground looks around     we see that he has been
confined in the trunk of a    pontiac firebird

the firebird and dodge ram are parked on a bluff red
stands on the highest point peering through binoculars
at the desert below he glances at jeff

                           red
             youre a tough man to get a hold
             of jeffrey

jeff stares a mix of emotions  anger fear confusion

                           jeff
                    barely able to
                     control himself

earl and billy hoist jeff to his feet and propel him up
the mound closer to red

from here jeff can see a small desert town spread out
below as well as the highway leading through it red
gestures

          now take a look at the building
          with the flagpole

jeff hesitates then raises the binoculars


through binoculars

the image shifts then steadies and focuses on a small
building with a police cruiser out front and a barely
legible sign brackett sheriff its the police
station where jeff filed the missing persons form
earlier

                        red os

          minute ago one of my men called in
          a noninjury accident on the i40
          connector

deputy carver comes out of the building gulping down a
sandwich he gets in the cruiser and pulls away lights
flashing

                        red os
          itll take that good ol boy 20
          minutes to get to the connector

testing it   as a club its too bulky he wont be able
to conceal   it

last look around the bathroom then exits

shoulder every few moments his eyes narrow

the dodge ram pickup is cruising toward him it slows
then brakes to a halt the passenger door opens earl

          the money then you find out
          unless you want me to shoot you

him in view of passing traffic

jeff hesitates then tosses the envelope on the      seat
earl opens it reaches in and pulls out several      packets
of currency they are wrapped with paper bands       and
appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds he       replaces
them and gestures at jeff with the gun

                        earl
          now lift your shirt and jacket and
          turn around

          turn around hands behind your
          back and step toward the truck

jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side

with several layers of duct tape

                        earl
          now get up in the truck knees on
          the floor do it now!

jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the
floor facing the rear of the pickup his belly pressed
against the seat

earl reaches over and pulls the door shut he throws the
truck in gear and starts driving jeff grimaces looking
up at him

                        jeff

the door by contorting his arms he is able to draw the
letter opener from his pocket

cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists

the moving truck he and billy slide out a long metal
box similar to a drawer in a morgue

they lift the metal lid revealing 


canvas sack

screams muffled

amy reacts writhing even more violently but shes no
match for the three men

the men disappear with amy into the cellar we hear a
metallic thud then a few moments later the men reappear
without her red closes the trap door secures it with a
heavy padlock then slides the panel of false flooring
over it

he crosses the room bumping into a workbench he
swears makes his way toward the


int rear of barn  night

jeff drops to his hands and knees feeling for the
padlocked trap door he finds it speaks in an urgent
whisper

knocks over   a cardboard box  a pile of car keys spill
across the   table his hands run over an assortment of
tools  he   locates a hammer takes it

returning to the trap door jeff inserts the claw in the
padlock and tries to pry it open the lock wont give

                                                continued

with guns he fumbles with the clip ejects it the
clip is full of bullets

he snaps the clip back in place

             go to hell

he boots red in the chest sending him backward down the
steps he slams the trap door shut and locks the
padlock

he looks around sees a massive tool chest         he tips it
onto the trap door  crash!

then he takes amys hand still keeping an eye out for
billy

                           jeff

aging bluecollar workhorse equipped with sidemounted
toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder

around to see the peterbilt bearing down from the side

jeff turns the key the engine catches!   he throws the
ford in gear and floors the gas

the ford shoots out of the peterbilts path!


highway

the ford peels out of the driveway and joins the road
spewing exhaust its an old vehicle that doesnt
maneuver well


in ford

jeff mashes the gas pedal the engine strains
backfiring amy looks back sees the peterbilt joining
the road

                         amy

a shotgun blast shatters the passenger window! amy
screams as glass showers the cab jeff swerves wildly

                         jeff
           what the fuck!

on the righthand shoulder

the driver billy is levelling a shotgun through the
window

whips around sees 


cadillac deville

pulling even with them on jeffs side the drive al
leers as he spins the wheel and creases the ford 
crunch!


jeff

raises the pistol and fires!


highway

the ford is sandwiched between the cadillac and firebird
as they race down the highway with the peterbilt in the
rear


jeff

lets out a cry as they carom off the cadillac blood
flows in a trickle down his neck amy sees it
panicking

                        amy
          jeff!

                         jeff
          its glass!   use the rifle!

amy raises the rifle thrusts the barrel awkwardly out
the window and aims at billy she fires wildly  bang!


billy

grins as the shot whistles past harmlessly he reloads
the shotgun snaps it shut and returns fire  blam!


highway

the blast hits the fords sidemounted toolbox     the door
flies open tools scatter on the road!

                                                      106

billy

veers away swearing as hammers and chisels and power
tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path

the front end of the extension ladder comes free from the
lumber rack and hinges into his path smashing the
windshield!

                         billy
          sonofabitch!

billy swears and jerks the wheel steering away he
glances up suddenly sees jeff aiming the pistol

the pistol fires!

billy slams backward against the headrest hit in the
face theres blood everywhere the car careens toward
the shoulder

the firebird hits a mound of earth flies through the air
and lands with a crash!


in peterbilt

pulls closer taking billys place alongside the ford


in ford

amy sees the peterbilt advancing whipping her head to
the other side she sees al raising a pistol

                         amy
          look out!

al jacks the trigger  blam!    blam!


on peterbilt

a stray bullet slices the hydraulic brake line running to
the trailer the hose hisses and whips through the air!


in peterbilt

red swears and lets the truck fall back swearing up
ahead is a long curving downgrade he taps the brakes
there is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor

                                           continued

highway

the peterbilt descends the grade letting out a rapid
fire blat of backfires its gaining speed bearing down
on the ford


in ford

amy turns in the seat terrified the truck looms
closer jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor

                              jeff
             hang on!

they are flying into a hairy curve


in peterbilt

red struggles to stay in control every time he applies
the brakes the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward

the peterbilt races into the curve

red has no choice he has to pump the brakes and risk
jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road
altogether

he hits the brakes!


highway

the huge truck screeches on the asphalt tires smoking
cab and trailer folding at right angles!

then unexpectedly the trailer disconnects from the cab!


in cadillac

flanking the peterbilt al glances to the side and sees
the trailer come untethered from the cab

now the trailer is an unguided missile weaving drunkenly
back and forth across the blacktop

al tries to swerve away the trailer streaks toward him
al slams on the brakes screaming!

                                                        108

highway

the trailer piles into the cadillac there is a huge
impact as trailer and cadillac are reduced to scrap
metal!

and just as this is happening


peterbilt

blasts into the rear of the ford jarring it forward with
a crunch of metal and taillights!


jeff

slams against the wheel amy is thrown against the
dashboard the ford is being propelled downhill by the
peterbilt


highway

the two vehicles are now locked together gaining speed
as they hurtle down the grade


jeff

jams the pistol through the rear passthrough window and
fires at red in the truck bullets ping off the grille

the gun clicks empty


in peterbilt

red hits the brakes but its no use the bumpers are
meshed the two vehicles plunge downhill skidding
sideways

up ahead a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge


highway

the peterbilt and ford fly onto the bridge the big
truck glances off a railing the vehicles suddenly come
unlocked

the ford plows into the concrete railing with a crash!

the peterbilt creams it from behind and caroms away
skidding the length of the bridge before smacking the
opposite railing!

                                                        109

inside road

jeff grimaces in front of them the concrete railing
has broken away debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of
the gorge the fords right front tire hangs in the air

jeff looks at amy   she looks wildly adrenalated eyes
wide

                           jeff
          you all right

amy looks back at him   she expels a long breath and
nods

jeff forces his upper body through the drivers window
and looks over the fords roof at the peterbilt


jeffs pov  peterbilt

its facing them 50 yards away on the bridge the
engine is dead steam hisses from the crumpled radiator
one tire is shredded

there is blood on the broken windshield


back to jeff

sitting in the drivers window he squints toward the
truck searching for any sign of red there is none

                         amy os
          jeff

                         jeff

          jeff i cant get out

jeff drops back into the cab the dashboard is crushed
against amys legs she tries to wriggle free

                         jeff
          what is it

                        amy

                           amy

jeff blinks he climbs out of the ford runs around to
amys side and yanks the door it comes open with a
creak of metal

behind jeff on the bridge a motor kicks over   he
whirls


jeffs pov  peterbilt

exhaust belches from the smokestacks red is behind the
wheel his face is covered with blood he stares
hatefully

with a rasp of gears the peterbilt lurches forward


back to jeff

he pushes against the dashboard with lifeordeath
urgency

                          jeff
            cmon amy push!

amy struggles and struggles to free her legs

                          jeff
            push goddammit!

amy glances toward the peterbilt terrified


peterbilt

creeps toward the ford the trucks grille is smashed
one wheel rim scrapes the asphalt it gains speed


in ford

jeff crawls over amy and tries pushing with his legs
she winces as the metal cuts into her skin jeff
strains

                           amy
                    turning reacting
            jeff!

                                                       111

peterbilt

rams the rear of the ford  crash! it jars the pickup
farther through broken concrete guardrail


in ford

jeff and amy are thrown forward by the impact the
peterbilts engine roars its pushing them over the
edge!


in peterbilt

reds eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces
the pickup farther through the broken railing


ford

lurches through the widening gap in the railing
concrete sails into the canyon the front tires hang
over the void


in ford

jeff strains against the dashboard it wont give     he
whips around swearing and leaps from the ford

                           amy
                    panicked
            jeff


on bridge

jeff runs to the peterbilt and jumps on the drivers side
running board grasping the door handle

red heaves the door open suddenly it strikes jeffs
head with a crack! he falls backward to the ground


in peterbilt

red presses the gas yelling over the engine roar the
railing is giving way he sees jeff struggling to his
feet

                          red
            you think you can come into my
            life and fuck with me nobody
            fucks with me!

                                             continued

                                                       112

continued

he looks down   jeff is no longer visible   red frowns

suddenly the passenger side door flies open and jeff
surges into the cab landing on red clawing at his eyes!

they grapple in the cab red swings an elbow into jeffs
face  crack jeff drives a fist to his jaw!

the steering wheel drifts counterclockwise as the truck
inches forward ramming the ford closer to the precipice

red gets his hands around jeffs neck as the steering
wheel continues to move counterclockwise


on bridge

the truck is no longer hitting the ford squarely
instead the peterbilts right front tire is riding up
and over the cargo bed crushing the left side of the
ford under its massive weight


in peterbilt

red has both hands around jeffs windpipe    he glances up
for a second reacts but its too late


on bridge

the peterbilt is surging up the drivers side of the
ford using the pickup like a ramp!


in ford

amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened
under the peterbilts weight!


on bridge

for an instant the peterbilts front tires seem to hang
in the air then the truck is falling!


in peterbilt

red and jeff are thrown forward in the cab still
flailing at each other as the truck plunges nosefirst
into the gorge

then it jerks to a halt in midair!

                                                       113

on bridge

the left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on
the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete
railing

the peterbilt is dangling nosedown from the bridge!


in peterbilt

jeff slams into the windshield red lands on top of him
loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield

they grapple red grabs jeffs arm and twists sharply
forcing it at an impossible angle their faces are
inches apart

                          red
            you think you can fuck with me!

he headbutts jeff viciously  crack! blood erupts from
jeffs nose and mouth red is about to deliver another
blow when

 the windshield falls away! the loose items in the
cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below

jeff drops through the windshield opening he clings to
the center support column his legs dangle over the
hood

red slips through the opening his hand locking on the
steering wheel at the last instant

the windshield sails away into the gorge


on bridge

the iron rebar groans its beginning to give way under
the weight of the truck the truck slips slightly


on peterbilt

jeff feels the truck shifting he grabs the windshield
wiper blade with his free hand the blade snaps away

red is clinging to the steering wheel he flails at jeff
with his feet swearing jeff is barely out of reach

jeff looks to the side there is a grabhandle on the
corner of the cab he reaches with his free hand and
seizes the handle

                                                      114

on bridge

the rebar groans the truck is wedged against the ford
as the truck slips it forces the ford closer to the
edge


on peterbilt

jeff clings to the handle he reaches for the passenger
side door handle working his way up toward the bridge


rebar

gives away once more and 


jeff

scales the cab finding more handholds   he climbs past
the passenger door

behind him red is working his way higher in the same
manner he grabs jeffs foot trying to pull him off the
cab

jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment
red grabs the door handle jeff boots the door release
button

the passenger door flies open!

red falls away as the door opens hes clinging to the
open passenger door suspended over the gorge


in ford

amy breathes in sharply feeling the ford move closer to
the edge she struggles to free her legs from the
dashboard

                          amy
            oh god jeff


jeff

climbs higher the peterbilt slips again    below red
loses his grip and almost falls

jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of
exertion he runs to the passenger side of the ford

                                            continued

                                                        115

continued

the ford teeters precariously any move could send it
over the edge jeff can only extend his hand to amy over
the void

                          jeff
            cmon amy its all you now
            you can do it

with a huge effort amy frees herself from the dashboard
and reaches for jeffs outstretched hand just as 


peterbilt

comes free from the rebar!


amy

takes hold of jeffs hand


peterbilt

plummets into the canyon!


red

screams!


peterbilt

seems to fall forever before landing with a huge
explosion!


on bridge

jeff and amy fall backward on the road down below
secondary explosions rock the canyon jeff takes amy in
his arms

                          amy
            dont let me go jeff

                          jeff
            i wont baby i wont ever let
            you go

he looks into her eyes   their lips meet in a kiss and
we 

                                              dissolve to

                                                       116

ext reds house  day

police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the
house radios chatter yellow crime tape holds back
onlookers and news reporters

cops and evidence technicians work the scene a
criminalist photographs stolen property as its carried
out of the barn

a plainclothes fbi agent closes a cellphone and walks
over to where jeff and amy are sitting at a picnic table
they are battered and bandaged

                        jeff
          hows the sheriff

                        fbi agent
          out of surgery it looks like
          hes gonna make it as for the
          wife and kid shes not talking
          hes being turned over to
          protective services

jeff nods soberly

                        fbi agent
          weve got id on the dead
          suspects turns out they were all
          licensed truckers one of em had
          a rap for check kiting otherwise
          they couldve been model citizens

                        jeff
          what about the leader

                        fbi agent
          same thing his real names
          warren claney three speeding
          tickets in five years  apart
          from that hes clean as a
          whistle

amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn

                         amy
                 dazed
          how could they do it how could
          they treat it like a business

                       fbi agent
                shaking his head
         i dont know ive been doing
         this 15 years ive never seen
         anything like it
                       more

                                             continued

                                                         117

                           fbi agent contd
             it was simple efficient and
             organized they stayed on the
             move spread it over a dozen
             states as long as no witnesses
             survived its an untraceable
             crime
                    looking at them
             you were just a couple of the
             lucky ones

up ahead a television news helicopter is landing on the
road a cameraman reporter and producer hurry over

jeff watches the news crew a bemused expression   it
seems like a million years ago

the fbi agent shakes his head disdainful

                       fbi
                re media
         cmon  lets get you folks out
         of here before things really get
         hairy

he escorts them to a waiting sedan as they climb in
jeff looks back over his shoulder surveying the scene
one last time

he gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied
news crew arrives mikes and cameras at the ready
running alongside the departing sedan shouting
questions

through the rear window we see jeff putting his arm
around amy pulling her close as we hear

                        amy
          promise me one thing

                          jeff
          name it

                        amy
          next time we fly


ext house  aerial  day

over this last line the sedan drives away and we climb
higher and higher away from the bristling crime scene
until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest
houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in
every direction
                                           fade out
                         the end
