               nick stares at her  the sad truth of her statement sinking 
               in

                              after a beat
                         was she ever found

               a flicker of loss crosses his face

               circles on beths skin

                                     sid
                         she wanted to meet someone new i

               nick looks like hell  his eyes red his hair a mess the 
               nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard

               the car windows are open the roar of the wind competing 
               with the blasting radio

               nick suddenly jerks the wheel over

               ext abandoned rest stop  continuous

               the sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest 
               area

               it stops facing a battered phone booth  the engine turns 
               off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth

               in the sedan

               nick turns off the radio it is suddenly very quiet  only 
               the occasional lonely drone of a truck passing on the highway 
               he takes a deep breath

               int phone booth  moments later

               nick is standing in the phone booth harshly lit by his 
               headlights

               he hangs up he hits himself in the head in angry disbelief 
               he hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment desperately 
               summoning up all his salesman charm
