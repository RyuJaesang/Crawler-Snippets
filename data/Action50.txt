fade in


ext the big blue sky  day

a virgin air 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off

int virgin air 747  day

we move through the first class cabin its the regular
mix of first class people old money in gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies a millionaire in jeans and a t
shirt business people relaxing after a tough day and

a very nervous man

shiftyeyed alone in an aisle seat the emergency row
we hold on him for a moment but not for too long then
we continue moving into 

the coach section

stopping at the lavatory the occupied sign switches to
vacant and

james earl jones

or actually a james earl jones type who for ease of
description well simply refer to as james earl jones
steps out of the restroom in full african regalia
multicolored dashiki mufti its a kind of hat the
works he heads up the aisle towards 

the first class cabin

where he is stopped by a 

                         flight attendant
           im sorry sir this cabin is
           restricted to first cl

mr jones now removes a first class ticket

                         james earl jones
           is this what youre looking for

she looks at it  a little confused as to why hes just
handing it to her now  but then she nods as he passes

                         flight attendant
           oh im sorry please is there
           anything i can get you

                         james earl jones
           scotch blended straight

he continues into the first class cabin and toward 

charlies angels  8/18/99                              2

the first class emergency room

where he slides in past the nervous shiftyeyed man his
name is pasqual and sits by the window

after a moment pasqual quietly clears his throat and
leans slightly towards jones

                        pasqual
                 tentatively
          they say birds cant fly this high

                        james earl jones
          they say only angels can

now pasqual nods nervously begins to remove something
from his pocket when they are interrupted by 

                        flight attendant
          shall i pour your scotch

                        james earl jones
          no  ill take the bottle thank you

she hands him the airplanesized bottle  he waves off
the glass she shrugs leaving

pasqual to resume what he was doing slowly he removes
a roll of certs he looks to jones  well what about
your end of the bargain

from within his dashiki jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch he hands it to pasqual who opens it to find
diamonds a helluva lot of diamonds pasqual smiles

he hands the roll of certs to jones its not breath
candy at all but a tiny roll of explosives with a tiny
hightech triggering mechanism

                        james earl jones
          ah c5 the most dangerous
          explosive material ever invented
          hard to believe that this little
          contraption could blow up ten city
          blocks

                        pasqual
          be careful with it huh

both men smile   pasquals very relieved that the deal is
done

then suddenly the lights blink out

pasqual looks around nervous but its just the in
flight movie beginning clouds and a woman holding a
torch

james earl jones shakes his head rolls his eyes

                           james earl jones
             another movie from an old tv show

                           pasqual
             well whatre you gonna do

                               james earl jones
             walk out

                           pasqual
             thats very funny

but james earl jones is dead serious

                               james earl jones
             no   it isnt

jones grabs pascal in a headlock and turns toward the
back of the plane shouting

                            james earl jones contd
             everyone!   fasten your seat belts!

now jones does the unthinkable holding pasqual tight
he yanks open the emergency door release

with a rush the cabin decompresses

panic erupts as air paper and everything not belted in
screams out of the open door including 

ext the big blue sky  falling away from the 747  day

 james earl jones still holding pasqual in a bear hug
they plummet wind violently tearing at them pasquals
frantic screams doppler quite nicely

dropping with them

they continue to fall gaining speed pasqual is
terrified but jones doesnt seem worried in fact
casually he glances at his watch and then looks 

far below them  across the sky

at the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the
distance

charlies angels  8/18/99                               4

closer  on that black speck

its a jet helicopter its door opens and now a skydiver leaps
out helmet down arms back streaking across the
sky in aerodynamic perfection heading directly towards

jones and pasqual

who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal
velocity jones begins to let go of pasqual who screams
and tries to clutch onto him desperate

                        james earl jones
                 over the rushing wind
          pull yourself together we have
          company
                        pasqual
          what

suddenly  whommppph!!  the skydiver spreadeagles
stopping the wild dive directly behind pasqual and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him

all three are still freefalling

james earl jones nods at the skydiver who even under the
helmet and goggles is clearly a beautiful woman

meet alexandra alex munday one of charlies angels
shes a sultry bombshell  a classic femme fatale 
only shes playing for the good guys

she gives james earl jones a wink then jerks pasquals
rip cord and  whoomph pasquals chute deploys he
flies upward leaving 

alex and james earl jones both still falling    below the
ocean screams up at them not much time left

james earl jones pulls his belt  and his mufti flies
up its actually a tiny drogue chute deploying his
entire dashiki his outfit hides a parachute rig

alex pulls her own rip cord and  whoomph  her chute
unfurls and now

alex and james earl jones gently float towards 

ext the big blue sea  day

a cigarette boat floats through the choppy water a
gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling

a burst of steam clears revealing bosley he waddles forward
in his shower clogs which squish with every step hes wearing
two towels one around his waist and a second around his
chest

as more steam dissipates we see there    are seven men sitting on
the risers six are gorgeous ranging     from calvin klein models
to marlboro men bosley looks around     taking a keen interest
maybe hes checking them out maybe he    isnt we just dont
know

the seventh man is roger corwin who we recognize from
the videotape hes leaning forward a gold chain
dangling its beside him that bosley takes a seat

he sets the ice cup  and the transmitter  in a
strategic location

noticing that none of the other men have towels around
their bosoms bosley nervously undoes his revealing skin
the color of cooked salmon he fluffs up his sparse chest hair
then decides to smush it back down

he tries to make eye contact with corwin working way too
hard annoyed corwin finally looks over

             oh yeah hell be easy to spot
             with that open head wound

smudged his head with ketchup

int biltmore ballroom  day

a sophisticated reception is in full swing an ocean of
smart suits and power ties

dressed as a catering waitress natalie carries a tray of
hors doeuvres moving with her we pass roger corwin who
talks with another suit and further on a conservatively
dressed dylan who chats up a group of wall street types

                           dylan
             the average investor sees technology
             stocks as discrete entities this one is
             up 50 points this one is down 10 its
             only through derivative analysis that one
             sees the real power of that sector

a few nods    she makes a good point

                           broker guy
             which analysis method do you prefer

on dylan    shit     she tries to stall

                           dylan
             well there are so many options
             i mean who can say what the one
             best choice is

across the room

still walking natalie talks to no one

                           natalie
             kepplerwilson

back with dylan

                            dylan
             for my money kepplerwilson is a
             strong choice

more nods adlibbed agreement        the broker guy is impressed

excusing herself dylan turns and subtly touches her ear
where shes wearing a hidden radio

                             dylan contd

cluster of investors she bumps into a thin man

                            dylan
             pardon me

he doesnt respond but something about this man raises
her suspicions where has she seen him before as he
moves out of earshot

he waves her away no oops she drops a napkin in front
of him she kneels down to get it

as we move in very close on her tray we see that theres
a tiny digital display a metal detector is built into
the rim

it blips as she moves past his ankle and again as she
rises up past his chest the man just keeps walking

the man takes a sudden right into a service hallway

                           dylan contd
             why do they always run

she slips off her heels to give chase

int service hallway  day

the thin man comes around the corner       we stay tight on
him until he suddenly stops

natalie

has come around from the other side his bad guy instincts
tell him these women are working together hes boxed in

and then a ding!

elevator doors open beside him he looks in to see the clue
less bellboy who had a funky groove going on his headphones
in a single motion the thin man yanks the guy out into the
hallway and takes his place hits the button

from opposite directions natalie and dylan run to the
elevator but the doors have already shut checking the
panel

                           dylan
             hes going down

they take the stairs

int basement service hallway  day

natalie and dylan emerge from the staircase to find the
elevator empty to the left exit doors swing tellingly

ext downtown los angeles  day

nat and dylan smash through the exit doors and out into
the sundrenched streets of beautiful downtown los
angeles natalie immediately spots the thin man booking
down the alley

                           natalie
             that way
                                                   continued

and they take off after him

what ensues is the fastest wildest two chicks and one
guy foot chase youve ever seen here are some highlights

 thin man pulls himself clumsily over a chain link
fence dylan and natalie pull an old jackie chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily

 thin man still on foot waits for traffic to slow
then darts across the harbor freeway by the time dylan
and natalie get there traffic is roaring again
undeterred they make their way through tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi

 dylan is racing down an alley when a car comes barrelling
at her she leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her a la one of those thats incredible! stunts

 they chase the thin man into an industrial laundromat
the scene goes something like this

int industrial laundry room

thunderously loud with industrial washers and dryers operating
at full tilt natalie and dylan are just entering when

three shots

ring out    they dive for cover behind a massive washer
assembly

                           natalie
             there are times i wish we carried
             guns

                           dylan
             wheres the challenge in that

angle on the thin man planning his next move with no
good shot at the angels he aims high both guns blazing
he shots out the pipes over their heads sending down a
cascade of hot water

dylan and natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded

other pipes shatter from the change in pressure leading
to an interior thunderstorm steam fills the room as an
inch of water grows on the floor

natalie and dylan push rolling laundry carts in the thin
mans direction he shoots at them but quickly realizes
theyre just trying to waste his bullets

holstering one of his guns he dials his cell phone
                                              continued

charlies angels  8/18/99                                    29

continued

on the far wall natalie switches on the overhead hooks
which circle on a wire like a ski lift the thin man
looks up distracted not noticing 

dylan

as she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry
carts shes succeeded in circling behind the thin man
as he talks on the phone

she clears her throat      the thin man turns   she kicks
him in the jaw

knocked back he drops the phone which cracks and slips
under a washing machine

he crabwalks back then suddenly springs back to his feet
we werent expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy

he turns to see

natalie

right behind him with a coiled towel she grabs his gun
arm and expertly flips him but he reacts smoothly rolling
over to charge at natalie picking her up like a sack of
potatoes as he does he grabs her right in the tit

                             natalie
             hey!    hands off assh

before she can finish her sentence the thin man throws
natalie at dylan knocking them both down he jumps up
and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks
another releasing a wall of steam  we cant see a thing

by the time the fog clears the thin man is long gone

                           natalie
             okay to summarize damn

lying down in the water dylan reaches under the washer
to fish out the thin mans busted cell phone

int townsend agency back room  day

natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor the thin
mans cell phone connected by a data cable to the
townsend agency computers rapidly touching the screen
she calls up a list of the last thirtyfive phone calls
he received theyre all from the same location

                            bosley
             well   that was easy

the girls lean in and hug each other butts sticking out
to the left bosley starts playing oommpa oommpa oommpa
oommpa on a wraparound tuba hes wearing lederhosen
with a feather in his hat

natalie begins to yodel

dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug thug
two is approaching from behind curious what the hell is
going on

dylan begins to talksing a song in german about a too
curious goat and his worried mistress even with the pantomime
we have no idea whats happening it seems
wholesome but occasionally one of the girls touches the
other in a weirdly coquettish oddly sexual way

thug two looks at the address on the envelope

                           thug two
                    low
             they got the wrong address

 where a black catsuited alex stands at the
chimney a ribbon of smoke curls from the stack

pulling the pin from a canister she drops it down the
chimney

int mountain house great room  night

a cheerful fire burns in the oversized fireplace the
canister drops into the flames from above suddenly
venting a hissing cloud of halon gas the fire dies
immediately the logs covered with a violent frost

int the chimney  night

alex doesnt even need a rope her feet pressed to the
sooty walls she expertly slides to the bottom

int great room  night

alex backs out of the fireplace to find a waiting bad guy
swinging

a fireplace poker

at her head she ducks just in time     the poker chings
against the stone making a spark

rolling jumping and diving alex scurries as pokerman
slashes and stabs she ducks behind a chair which
pokerman catches with the hook winging it across the
room

backed against the wall alex yanks on the heavy
curtains pulling them down along with the wooden
curtain rod a spin a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff

she goes on the offensive    thrust parry spin

but hes a worthy adversary one good karate kick breaks
her staff in two she uses both pieces to club him in
the knees then rolls back to the fireplace

she grabs the remaining tool the fireplace tongs
pokerman swings alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall

a quick kick knocks pokerman to the floor where alex
rolls on top of him she catches his head in the tongs
squeezing his temples his eyes bulge

hes the last to be pulled into the van    a spray of
gravel and theyre off

int the van  night

everyone is piled on top of each other dylan and knox
have a few awkward moments as they get untangled bosley
keeps making inappropriate tuba noises

at the wheel natalie is fierce and focused in total
control

looking out the back windows alex sees the kidnappers
piling into jeeps to give chase from the side of the
house more thugs appear on motorbikes

                        alex
          theyre coming after us

          okay new problem

everyones attention whips forward to see the headlights of

giant logging truck

coming up the high mountain road it straddles the
center line blocking both directions theres no way
around it
                         natalie contd
           thoughts suggestions points to

she points to a faded closed sign that hangs from a
chain in the darkness who knows what its blocking
but as we hear the thunderous horn from the oncoming
truck we know theres no choice

natalie cuts a hard right smashing through the sign

the van thumps and bumps its way across the low grass
its headlights only showing ten feet ahead at any
moment the ground could stop in a cliff

like now

the van leaps into empty space      tires spin helpless
the van falls

everyone screams    bosley is the loudest

and then touchdown the van hits the ground hard but
not catastrophically natalie hits the brakes cuts the
wheel hard to avoid hitting

a concrete wall

in front of them    everyone takes a beat to acknowledge
theyre alive

                             dylan
             where are we

suddenly a bright light goes on overhead

ext the mountain  night

one by one a series of arc lights switches on forming a
snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain

int the van  night

looking out the back windows

                           alex
             its a bobsled run

theyre facing backwards

up ahead the kidnappers are charging down the access roads
the first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute

                           natalie
             if it goes down the mountain
             thats all i need

throwing it into reverse natalie peels out

the jeeps follow

ext bobsled run  night

the vw van leads the way down the mountain tailfirst
as it builds speed it starts to climb the wall each turn
getting steeper and steeper

the two jeeps are following facing the right direction
they have a much easier time of it

int van  night

everything is shaking so violently it looks like a nasa launch

                         alex
                  looking out the back
           hard left! hard left!

natalie makes the turn the van rises up nearly tilting
over but they make it through the turn

                         knox
                  to dylan
           is this part of the plan

                         dylan
           yes except for the bobsled run
           and the backwards part its
           going exactly according to plan

a beat   he smiles at her   he has a nice smile

ext bobsled run  night

one of the jeeps makes a move closing the distance to
the van a rifleman leans out the passenger window
lining up a shot he fires

int the van  night

the shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield
through the horn of bosleys tuba then out the back window   it
missed hitting somebody by millimeters

natalie is still focused making each turn as alex calls it

ext bobsled run  night

the front jeep gets even more aggressive building speed

it hits the next turn too fast rising up too high along
the wall it tips further and further finally rolling
over onto its back it scrapes across the concrete a
shower of sparks as it slows down

with nowhere to go the second jeep brakes hard but cant stop
it smashes into the first jeep a tangle of steel

the combined mass continues sliding down the run like a
jagged pinball in the chute

int the van  night

dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes
farther and farther away

                           dylan
             i think were in the clear

just then two motorbikes race up along the chute walls passing
the crippled jeeps two more motorbikes jump in from above

                             dylan
             or maybe not

suddenly natalie gasps remembering something

                             natalie
             oh god no

             i never knew how they died when i

                           knox

             in the military he and my mother were
             killed while he was on assignment
             somewhere in eastern europe
                    mostly to himself
             the files were classified but i
             read enough to know that he was a
             good man apparently he was
             betrayed by one of his own team

                            dylan

gives alex a thumbs up

natalie roars back onto the track keeping corwin in her
sights then she spots another red star car coming up
right next to her she locks eyes with the thin man

the two of them recognize each other at the exact same

brakes and skids off to the right which leads to a ramp
that heads out of the stadium

natalie not wanting to lose him does something crazy
even though shes at the front of the pack she brakes
hard swerves into a full 180 degree uturn and starts
heading the wrong way on the race track

close to empty  these cars are meant to be refilled often

 but when youre going 200 miles per hour that can
take a while he misses the exit

the thin man pulls over to the side stops fully
braking as hard as she can natalie still passes him

the thin man throws a uturn heading up the freeway onramp

natalie follows

revs his engine higher

angle on natalie if its a game of chicken he wants
shell give it to him she revs her engine higher still

the noise scares the bird who suddenly flies off like
a flag being dropped thats the signal for both racers
to peel out

a cloud of smoke    rubber on asphalt

already reaching a tremendous speed the racers are on a
collision course the thin man isnt going to turn away
neither is natalie

racing faster and faster still theres only one way
this can turn out but then at the very last moment
the thin man wusses out he cuts the wheel right
missing natalie and careening off the edge of the pier

in slow motion we watch as his racer hangs in midair
wheels still spinning backheavy the tail hits the
water first

natalie brakes hard cuts the wheel to avoid going off
the far end of the pier she finally stops the rear
tire just 1/4 inch from the edge

craning up along the side of the pier we find natalie
looking into the water where the blue racer went in
theres just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles

             still have to get inside that room
             to install it what about security

                           alex
             red star has a lot of government

silenced gunfire its only alexs instincts that let
her duck in time to avoid being turned into swiss cheese

she tucks and rolls behind a styrofoam set as

two gunmen with silenced sniper rifles fan out on the
fake city street

on alex 

crouched behind a wall

she looks both ways if she tries to break for the open
loading door shell lead the gunmen right back to jason
only way out of here is to head for the far wall all the
way across the building where theres a fire exit

taking a deep breath she darts across the fake street

the gunmen

fire at her one of them pulling off his silencer and going
to machine gun mode the sound of the gunshots are covered
by the sound of the effects guy test firing guns outside

alex 

sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams
she lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow cracking the
twobyfours in half

the gunmen

move slowly through the fake street set suddenly they
hear a creaking sound they look up to see the whole
fake building set collapsing!

they dive out of the way just in time to see alex race
through the fire doors

natalie shuts the door behind herself then sets to work
putting down a tissuepaper seat cover

sweeping across the floor

we look under stall doors to find a pair of black mens
boots stepping down from inside natalie is not alone

in her stall

natalie is about to hoist her skirt when she stops         her
spider sense is tingling

a door latch

clicks open we tilt up to see a welldressed man          hes
at least 63

he stops at natalies stall door drawing his gun      a
beat then he kicks the door open revealing

an empty stall

the automatic toilet flushes itself      the man takes a
halfstep in confused suddenly

the door swings back smashing into his right hand     he
drops the gun looking up to see

natalie

who is perched atop the stall walls     she pushed the door
with her foot

grabbing an overhead pipe she performs an acrobatic
swing landing both feet on the guys head he falls
into the next row of stalls

natalie reaches for the gun but the man grabs her ankles
he pulls her back across the tile floor flipping her over
that just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts

with a scissors lock around his neck natalie is pulled
up while the man falls she lands a knee on his windpipe

                           natalie
             who do you work for

he tries to pull her off    she leans in harder

                           natalie contd
             speak now or never again

                            the man
                    motioning with eyes
             jacket pocket

suspicious she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather
billfold flips it open to reveal an id that reads

                             knox

he helps her up a steep part of the path       as she comes
over the crest of a hill

although knox is clueless its clear the message vivian
is sending to dylan shes in control here

vivian sets the gun on the table in easy reach

                           knox
                    explaining
             vivian just came over to run through
             some numbers for the ipo

                           vivian wu
             please take a seat im almost
             finished

with a knowing glance at dylan she goes back to her
phone call

no alternative dylan takes a seat beside knox     both face
vivian whose hand is very near the gun

dylan looks at knox as he reads through his papers    he has no
idea theres anything wrong

                           vivian wu contd
                    on phone
             really how disappointing

vivian gestures to the abandoned scrabble game on the table
why not play

                           dylan
             im not much for games

as knox flips pages in the report dylan casually begins
pushing scrabble letters around nothing serious but shes
managed to spell

enemy

she gets knoxs attention looks to the word up to vivian
knox follows her intention but doesnt seem to believe it

while vivian continues to talk on the phone knox sets his
report down pushes around some letters of his own the
words finally come out as

close on dylan      what does that mean

vivian snaps her phone shut

vivian draws the gun on her    knox moves over toward
vivians side

             sorry dylan i knew this moment
             would come sooner or later i was
             just hoping for later

a long beat dylan trying to wrap her head around this

                           dylan
             all this time we thought red star
             was behind this but it was you
                    realizing
             you faked your kidnapping

knox taps his nose    shes got it

             and unrelated complication

             oh well in that case i feel a lot
             better about you being a lying pole
             smoker

dylan looks like shes about to leap forward and tear knoxs
throat out vivian gestures for dylan to keep stepping back

             something useful like kill you
             goodbye dylan ill miss you

how right he is because as soon as vivian squeezes the
trigger

dylan drops to the floor then rolls

blam!

the bullet misses dylan and slams into the bulletproof window
causing a spiderweb crack to spread dylan sees her
opportunity and heads right for the window while vivian
pumps off shots

as she comes to the window dylan jumps up in the air and
does a flying kick hitting right at the spot where the
bullet impacted

smash!

the bulletproof glass shatters outward and dylan flies out
the window onto the ledge

fall looks like it would kill her but she doesnt have
much choice

             plan you gonna sell a list of our

             no just leaving myself plenty of
             margin for error goodbye dylan

with that he walks out of the room

the thin man signals to the henchmen two of them force
dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs

then with the thick packing tape they begin binding her
arms to the arms of the chair as they do

             right here is just me stalling

           time we have spent together

two goons race up the stairs into the office   natalie
turns to face them

                         pete contd

                  into phone
           can you hold on a sec

hitting mute natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives
under the desk she comes up on the other side with a

surge suppressor

electric cords attached she backhands it into the
goons who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through
their bodies

                         natalie contd
                  unmuting
           one more sec

she remutes

with a roundhouse kick she flattens one of the goons
whacks the other with the cell phone

the first goon charges at her but she sidesteps at the
last moment leaving goon one to hit goon two both men
topple through the open window falling yikes

antique chair at her head

she ducks    the chair shatters the display case

scrambling to get away natalie drops the phone

                           pete
             natalie what was that

                           natalie
                    yelling to phone
             everythings fine!

                           vivian wu
             hate to disagree

vivian upends the desk nearly crushing natalie vivian
jumps on top ready to kick the shit out of our angel

as we probably suspected vivian wu is one hell of a
martial artist fortunately so is natalie

in their first series of blows vivian seems to have the
upper hand but natalie rallies hard vivian surprises
her with a floorsweeping kick knocking her down

vivian grabs the phone off the floor

                           vivian wu contd
             is this the famous charlie

                    confused
             no its pete

vivian looks at the phone who the fuck cares      she
throws the phone out the open window

getting up natalie stares her down incredulity building
to rage

                            natalie
             you bitch!   i like that guy

mocking vivian wipes away a tear

natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury a fullout mortal
kombat vivian is thrown back against the bookcase
where she knocks over a candlestick

thats the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor circling around the room each set of
shelves drops to a different level forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room

as natalie and vivian continue to fight bosley sticks
his head down from above watching the brawl natalie is
kicking ass

                           natalie contd
                    to vivian
             do you have any idea how difficult it
             is to find a quality man in los angeles

she slams vivian into the wall      grabs her again hands
around her head

                             vivian wu
             to be honest

vivian suddenly leans forward and kisses her right on
the lips

                             vivian wu contd
             i dont care

natalie is surprised for a moment which gives vivian the
chance to swing at her she misses

                           natalie
             i can handle villainy i can even
             handle supervillainy
                    vivian swings and
                     misses again
             but what you did is just wrong

she headbutts vivian knocking her out cold   she throws
the limp body on the floor

a beat then natalie looks up to see bosley

                           natalie contd

ext verandah  day

from below we hear security whistles the compound has been
breached dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her

                           dylan
             here we go

and now she does exactly what she told the thin man shed do

she pitches forward ducking her head so the chairs back
crashes into the railing tearing it off she stands

                           dylan contd
             okay that part worked

the guards fire  but dylan has already launched herself
from the railing into that backflip which lands her on
the head of 

fat boy flattening him bad and smashing the rest of the
chair into kindling she grabs the wooden seat and whips
it up catching bullets from guard #3 before flinging it
like a frisbee at guard #2 nailing him right on the chin

quickly she stands again between guards #3 and 4

                           dylan contd
             now guys i warned you this is
             where you shoot each other

the two men scoff disbelieving then dylan does a head
fake both guards panic and fire but dylan drops leaving
each man a clear shot at the other both gape both fall

just guards #5 and 6 left    dylans chair arms are still
taped to her forearms

                           dylan contd
             okay heres where we improvise

in a whirl she overheadchops guard #5 drives her
right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm
into the back of the guard #6s head

continued

a few more blows then both men fall

now dylan drops into a second chair halfexhausted
halfamused with herself has one brief beat to take it
all in then 

bosley steps onto the veranda sees dylan sitting in the
chair

from his point of view it looks like dylan  whose
arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair 
is taped to the chair she now sits in

                           bosley
             oh my god let me help you

bosley hurries over freeing her amused dylan lets
him natalie steps out from inside pausing to kick one
guard who was starting to revive

doors gun still in her back alex is trying to think of an
escape quickly she knows that the second he gets her out

sweaty and exasperated from chasing her

             jason hi i

             sick of this asshole telling you
             what you can and cant do

and then with no warning he hauls off and punches the
thin man

now jasons just an actor not an asskicking super
detective so his punch isnt all that great in fact it
leaves jason shaking his hand in pain

the thin man a trickle of blood running from his lip smiles

                           thin man
             that was stupid

first he pops jason right in the jaw jason stumbles
backward dazed then he reaches for his gun in the
process loosening his grip on alex

                           alex
             jason get down!

alex spins out of the thin mans grasp and does a full
roundhouse kick knocking the gun out of the thin mans
hands the thin man immediately responds throwing two
quick punches which alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitchkick to the chin

jason dazed and confused thinks he must be hallucinating

                           jason
             what the hell is going on

whats going on is a world class asskicking courtesy of his
girlfriend while the action star watches in amazement alex
unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make
jet li green with envy

the thin man doesnt stand a chance a flying side kick
sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell we
follow the fight

int stairwell  continuous

 to the first landing the thin man battered and bruised
reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun but
alex is too fast for him she stamps on his hand then
drops a knee to his throat

                           alex
             right now just by leaning forward i
             could crush your windpipe youd die

jason slams out into the stairwell looking for alex he
finds her on her walkie talkie the thin man handcuffed

             ill be waiting for you

alex smiles    runs off

int arena

natalie stares up at the clock 30       29

the whistle blows

                            referee
             time out!

whew that was close but itll start up any second       she
has to keep it stopped but how she glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea

on the court 

music starts from overhead the respective teams cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine

as they kick into gear natalie comes out with them dressed
as a duke cheerleader she follows along with the dancers a
bit timid at first then more confident as she gets into it

int arena basement  beneath the court

dylan races through the basement looking for the briefcase
then she spots it hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above

dylan approaches it cautiously       she slowly opens the top

                           dylan
                    to herself
             alright dylan all we have to do is
             figure out which wire to cut

reveal the bomb 

there are about fifty different wires in every color in
the crayola box

                            dylan contd
             oh shit

int courtside

alex still searching for charlie notices something strange

                           alex
             youre kidding me

charlies angels  8/18/99                                98

natalie

is fully transformed on the court from wallflower to full
out cheerleader its not that shes as good as the other
cheerleaders shes better

on the court

the song ends the cheerleaders vacate the court but natalie
keeps dancing her heart out she has 18000 fans watching
her and shes totally in the moment but theres another
agenda as well

                        courtside radio announcer
          the time out is over but one
          cheerleader doesnt seem to notice
          officials cant start the clock again
          while shes on the court

                                                cut to

int miami arena  continuous

dylan has picked two wires

                        dylan
          chartreuse and magenta   this has
          gotta be it

she prepares to snip them with her wire cutters when

                        knox os
          i wouldnt do that if i were you

she spins to see knox standing behind her

                        knox contd
          see if you snip any of those wires
          the bomb will blow up

                        dylan
          its gonna blow anyway once the
          clock gets to zero

                        knox
          who told you that my idiotic
          henchman do you think i tell him
          anything thats confidential

he holds up a small triggering device its the same one
we saw pascal try to sell in the opening scene

                        knox contd
          this is what triggers that bomb     so
          if youll kindly step away ill
          refrain from killing both of us

                                                continued

realizing she has no choice dylan stands up and backs away

                        knox contd
          in different circumstances dylan i
          think you and i could have worked out
          we have a lot in common

                        dylan
          yeah i fall for assholes and you
          are one

knox laughs

                        knox
          good one
                 beat as he backs up
          well i must be going if you like
          your body parts attached to your
          torso i suggest you do the same

knox turns to go but the other angels are blocking his way

                        alex
          give it up knox youre surrounded

                        natalie
          give us the detonator

                        knox
          no!

stumbling backwards knox holds it up high

                        knox contd
          ill blow this building sky high i swear!

                        charlie os
          dont do it eric its me you want
          not all these innocent people

everyone turns as one to a figure emerging from the shadows

                        knox
          charlie

thats right its charlie finally after all these years
we get a look at him and boy is it disappointing

hes not what we expected short portly dressed in a
were #1 tshirt the angels are absolutely floored by
charlies appearance

                        angels
          charlie

charlie ignores their stares and addresses knox directly
                                              continued

                           charlie
             your father was a double agent eric
             yes i revealed him but he was killed
             by his own people before we could
             throw him in jail
                    beat
             he was my friend

                           knox
             its still your fault you arrogant
             prick! you still killed my father!

                           charlie
             maybe maybe i did but why should
             you kill all these people if you
             hate me so much just shoot me
             just shoot me eric

charlie spreads his arms leaving knox a plenty wide target

its a horribly tense moment       the angels are frozen watching
knox decide charlies fate

knox is sweating debating his choices can he really do
this charlies not the glamorous smug asshole he imagined
he starts lowering his gun

                           knox
             okay  youre right
                    quickly
             ill just kill you

blam!

it all happens in the blink of an eye knox fires hitting
charlie in the chest natalie leaps out and tackles knox
alex dives and grabs the detonator before it has a chance
to go off

dylan runs to charlies side

                            dylan
             charlie no   no!

she hold shim in her arms as the other angels gather round
their fallen leader he gasps for air

                           dylan contd
             hes trying to say something

then dylan notices something weird hes not gasping for
air theres something stuck in his mouth

with a great hacking cough he spits it out its a voice
chip like the one dylan used in the opening scene

                            bosley
             think so

he pulls back the padding from the suit revealing a small
wound where the bullet grazed his side

                           bosley contd
             hurts but it looks like itll heel

dylan laughs alex ruffles his hair

                           dylan
             hey wait a second if bosleys
             here then wheres charlie

the angels all look at each other      no one knows

ext center passage  day

in gorgeous slow motion the three angels walk sidebyside
with a calm assurance fireballs exploding behind them

they won

as music rises the angels triptych descends then peels
away to reveal

ext gorgeous beach  day

the angels kick back on the white sands tropical drinks in
hand bosley is there as well with a grass hat and zinc
on his sniffer

charlie is on the cellular speakerphone

                           charlies voice

             putting in some long hours on this case
             so i thought you might enjoy a chance to
             catch up with some old friends

natalie and alex turn to see

peter and jason

walking across the beach towards them each is carrying a
drink of his own they wave damn those men look good

alex and natalie share a smile

                           dylan
             any chance youll be joining us
             charlie

                                                cut to

a sunny deck

were in charlies pointofview we can see part of his
reflection in the window  not enough to see his face
but we get some sense of the man

he turns away begins walking    steps down onto the sand

                           charlie
                    to cell phone
             id love to angels but i have some
             precious treasures to watch over

with that he hangs up we stay in his pov walking
across the beach and its not just any beach

to the left we notice

pete and jason

approaching    were on the same beach

looking right we see the backs of the angels and bosley
they have no idea that charlie is walking right behind them

a beat then dylan looks back

she looks directly as us  at charlie  tracking as we
move past does she somehow recognize its charlie
from her reaction its not clear

a beat then we

charlies angels  8/18/99                            103

reverse angle/not pov

dylan looks back forward again did she just see charlie
her smile tells us she thinks she did

she raises a toast

                           dylan
          to charlie

                           the angels and bosley
          to charlie

they knock glasses

right at the moment we should probably fade out bosley
spills his icy drink in his lap his eyes go wide

the angels just have to laugh

we freeze frame then

cut to black

                               the end
