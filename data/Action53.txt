                         fade in

          ext alleyway village  dusk

          gloomy last light from out of the shadows comes            
          a dog a dog of war big mangy muscular scary as
          he moves down the alley the way becomes increasingly
          choked with fallen structures and signs of tumult

          ext battlefield  dusk

          tracking with the dog as he comes onto a battlefield
          the hellish scene is revealed to us slowly                 

          series of shots
          as the dog traverses a landscape of 
          bodies frozen in contorted death poses this was
          furious handtohand fighting between human soldiers and
          nightmare creatures their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon
          the dog climbs a mound of casualties at the top the
          dog looks back across the battlefield the dogs eyes
          are sad his expression weary and disgusted

                         dissolve to

          ext the palace of acrisius  night

          the entrance is patrolled by a dozen palace guards they     
          dont see the dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace    
          wall and disappear inside                                   

          int the palace of acrisius  great hall  night             

          bloodied and battered the kings generals are               
          disagreeing loudly about strategy a loud banging sound
          pierces the hubbub and the officers quiet turning to     
          king acrisius a striking man in his prime his handsome     
          face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw he commands      
          the room                                                   

                         king acrisius
          now we end the debate about
          tactics and begin to plan for
          victory

          at the back of the hall
          the dog stares at the king then slips away

          int the palace of acrisius  great stairs  night

          unseen by exhausted guards the dog bounds up the stairs     

          int the palace of acrisius  royal apartment  corridor 


                         night
          the dog approaches a doorway stops to watch from the         
          shadows

          int the palace of acrisius  bedchamber  dogs pov 


                         night
          in the dim bedchamber the silhouette of queen danae as a     
          ladyinwaiting removes her gown revealing the queens       
          perfect body as she slips into bed the ladyinwaiting
          leaves
          the dogs eyes he moves forward

                         floorlevel
          tracking with the dogs legs as they morph into human
          legs the camera rises behind a towering male figure
          who roughly pulls a curtain aside                            
          in the bed the queen is startled then pleased

                         queen danae
          my king! has the strategy been
          set so quickly

                         reverse angle
          the looming figure looks exactly like king acrisius          
          including the distinctive scar he regards her hungrily      

                         queen danae
          come to your queen my king

          int the palace of acrisius  great stairs  sunrise          

          the real king acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with         
          aides and guards suddenly the king stops                   

                         continued

                         continued
          on the wall above is the huge shadow of a fourlegged
          creature  and now it appears
          the dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
          men without fear  its eyes blaze with a gods power
          even acrisius who fears nothing steps back the others
          raise their weapons
          the dog comes down the steps eyes upon them and passes     
          close by no one dare move the dog disappears into the      
          shadows below                                               

                         dissolve to

          ext the sea  rocky promontory  close on king acrisius    


          hardened countenance  day
          staring at 

                         another angle
          queen danae pregnant now and weeping her arms are
          bound
          a royal entourage is gathered the women weep the men       
          agonize                                                     
          palace guards lift the queen into a chest and chain it       
          closed on the kings signal the guards carry the chest     
          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea we hear a
          scream from within
          some members of the royal entourage look with scorn at
          their king outraged by this double murder acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory
          we see in his face what the others do not  shame and
          doubt                                                       
          in the water below the chest rights itself and rides out    
          on the tide                                                 

          ext sand dunes of a lonely beach  night                    

          two horsemen gallop in the moonlight the first rider
          sways in the saddle and falls from his mount he
          staggers to his feet a skin of ale in his hands it is
          king acrisius very drunk
          the second rider the kings steward dismounts to give      
          aid though hes also drunk                                 

                         continued

                         king acrisius

                         raging
          my own subjects condemn me! they
          dare judge me and what emboldens
          this treachery

                      steward          
          you are mistaken my king none                                           
          would risk your anger                                                   

                      king acrisius    
          oblivious to him                                                        
          it is zeus who warps my

          this talk sobers the steward instantly he looks about                    
          fearlessly                                                               

                      steward          
          please speak not these things                                          
          acrisius spins on him out of control                   

                         king acrisius
          he cuckolds me in my castle rapes
          my precious queen! this is a low
          conniving god but i have bested
          him on this day and humbled the
          great prime

                         swigs ale
          tell me panos who rivals zeus on
          olympos who does the fearless
          one fear

          i beg you your highness                                
          acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the stewards
          throat

                         king acrisius
          tell me what the priests say!

          achieve it the ambitious goddess
          of the dark oceans

                         continued

                         king acrisius
          yes tiamat! and today i have
          honored her
          the king whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune        

                         king acrisius
          ive taken zeus whore and the
          bastard she grows in her belly and
          thrown them to tiamat in her rough
          sea!

                         king acrisius
          so that zeus will know i
          despise and disdain him and spit
          on his foul name!
          the steward shrinks from this blasphemy eyes darting in      
          fear                                                         
          on the crest the king is silhouetted in the moonlight        
          arms raised defiantly toward the heavens when suddenly     
           his figure is seized by some violent force shaking
          his being a horrible sound                                  muscle tears bones crack
          and the kings body grows larger as it distorts in

          misshapen disfigurement
          and thus king acrisius becomes kalibos!
          the steward sees what we now cannot an inhuman roar and
          the shadow of this new being falls upon the steward he
          screams but its too late  the huge creature grabs him
          by the neck and lifts him out of frame from the empty
          moonlit dunes we

          you knew about this and said
          nothing

          my queen i serve only the great
          order of things i was the boys
          tutor years ago

          how haughty this boy must be who                      
          knows he is halfgod

          he knows nothing and believes
          himself an ordinary man he has
          never left his village he can be                      
          overconfident but it is from                          
          inexperience not arrogance

          what assurance do we have that our

          as the net passes we see 
          anteros a hapless young fisherman his legs entangled in    
          the net desperately trying to hold his breath when
          they have disappeared we see a figure appear through the
          blue in pursuit as he passes we get our first look

          near the sharks snout the shark tries to swim through
          the hole but instead drags the net upwards perseus
          hangs on
          one more slice and the shark zooms out of the net
          bumping the young hero as it swims away perseus pulls

          in his arms five crewmen dive in to help but perseus
          is mad with despair they have to pull him away
          spyros watches sadly but also relieved to see the one
          survivor

          ext fishing trawler  day

          spyros makes his way to the bow where perseus sits
          alone downcast in pain spyros watches in silence

                         spyros
          your grieving does anteros no
          good it comforts only you

          its my fault hes gone

                         spyros
          he was careless with the net
          perseus gives him a hard look

                         perseus
          so its his fault not mine not
          fate not the gods

          now my history is i let my friend
          die in my arms i made it back
          why couldnt he

                         spyros

          to what purpose i failed him

          what ensnares men in the
          superstition of the gods as
          surely as your friend was caught
          in that net and all the
          searching leads down to the same

                         perseus
          you always say that my abilities
          are greater than other mens but
          they were not enough to save him

                         spyros
          you are still a man confined by
          mans limits you are just as
          likely to fail as succeed

                         perseus
          how is that greater than other
          men

          ordinary men fail most of the

          at the beginning of time when man
          was young he prayed to the gods
          his belief in the gods gave his

          began to put his faith in other

          or know despair for tiamat will
          rule the heavens and the earth
          perseus is mystified by this talk he turns to vidalia
          for explanation but she seems disturbed by the preacher   l

          cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor we
          follow to find
          kepheus speaking sternly to perseus before him

                         kepheus
           before i am a king or a
          peacemaker i am a father do you

          did not know my father

                         kepheus

                         thrown
          yes well it means i had no
          desire for my little girls
          carefree springtime to be cut

                         short 
          to cassiopeia

                         irritably
          what is she

                         cassiopeia

                         embarrassed
          im sure shes preparing herself
          to make the best possible
          impression
          perseus suppresses a smile amused by the royal couple
          kepheus paces with mounting impatience

                         kepheus

                         lecturing perseus

                         again
           and all so she could be thrust
          into a momentous conflict of
          which she knows nothing at all

                         guy
          i take no comfort in that young
          man in fact i find little to
          take comfort in here you are a
          stranger from a distant place and
          i am asked to entrust the welfare
          of my daughter to you

                         leaning into

                         perseus
          if you are not kind and patient
          with her if any harm of any kind
          should come her way i will have
          your head on a stake
          kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on perseus face he puts    
          his hand on the hilt of his sword

                         kepheus
          is this amusing to you

                         perseus
          not even a little my lord its
          just that i myself was waylaid 
          snatched also as you say from my
          happy springtime
          kepheus studies him to see if hes making jest of him

                         perseus
          ive been told im to play a                                
          part in events which serve a                                
          higher purpose of which im not                          
          at all convinced

                         kepheus
          does a truce in the war between
          men and gods not strike you as a
          higher purpose

                         perseus

          the wilting girl steals down the dark narrow alley        
          headed toward the outskirts of town
          suddenly a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones     
          blocking her way she startles but does not stop she
          goes up to the wall turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone like a ghost
          on the other side she emerges from the stone breathing    
          hard she looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway
          shes gone only a few steps when just ahead of her        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier she
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth
          she almost makes it through but at the last moment        
          vines wrap her arms and legs holding her prisoner she
          gives up with a sigh we hear the laughter of a god

          catches the blade in his jaws and snaps it in two!

          the men cant see it but one wall suddenly frames a
          silhouette of medusa hair of hissing snakes atop a
          womans torso the body of a mammoth reptile
          we see only glimpses of medusa as she slides through the
          shadows her forked tongue tastes the air
          cutting between spyros perseus and draco moving
          silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary
          our view of draco is suddenly blocked by medusa  she      
          coils around draco without touching him he hears the       
          rasp of scales on stone                                    

                         draco

          her torso behind him she rattles her tail in front
          draco spins and slices the air the rattle stops draco
          waits confused

          and looks
          medusas face is inches from dracos his muscles lock                
          and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone emanating smoky              
          gas medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically

          with the harpoon as its sails cleanly through slanted        
          pillars and debris whoosh whoosh until it comes
          through a tiny opening and

          perseus reaches the sickle he lifts his shield up in
          front of him and sees medusas reflection growing closer

          he shuts his eyes and wheels around blade sweeping a       
          soft fthmmp as the blade slices through something

          splits open                                                
          set points at vidalia slamming her into the earthen        
          wall the god is there in an instant strangling her       
          perseus staggers up and swings his sickle but set          
          points ripping the weapon from perseus hand it flies     
          across the shrine and sinks with a clang into the tablet    
          that once held vidalias true name                         
          still choking vidalia set grabs perseus arm perseus

          perseus slams the god down in a ghastly heap which
          liquefies into thick black blood it seeps into the
          sandy floor leaving an ugly stain                          
          perseus rushes to embrace vidalia who is more evanescent
          than ever they look with pain at the remains of amoun      

                         vidalia
          im so sorry perseus
          a look of brutal determined resolve grows in perseus

          you faced a god in lethal
          combat and vanquished him
          never have i heard of such a
          thing
          he looks at her mind racing then lifts her as he           
          stands

                         perseus
          we must go quickly now
          he pulls the sickle from the marble with a brinng! the
          light flashes off zeus lightning bolt pattern on the
          blade

          fearsome idol of tiamat unlike any representation weve

          andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony
          preparing to jump to her death she turns at the sound

          before he can fall peshet leaps to him and pulls out her    
          knife she plants herself in front of andromeda

           and crashes in a cloud of silt shaking the ocean
          floor like an earthquake a crack opens in the seabed
          and sucks back the silt the trench deepens and streaks
          away across the seabed swallowing all the water above

          he did with anteros the fisherman                          
          distraught his muscles go taut around andromeda and a

          arms into her still body  she jolts to life!

          too breathes again relieved
          for the first time since the start of the adventure they
          find themselves alone holding each other

                         relieved
          are you all right
          she takes a moment doing an inventory finally she
          nods

                         andromeda
          i think i am
          he smiles shell never know how close they came to          
          oblivion

                         andromeda
          are you ready to become a king
          his expression is kind but unmistakable no she          
          accepts that rueful

          then youre ready to go home
          perseus raises one arm theair reverberates to a loud      
          beating of wings andromeda looks up in wonder
          pegasus appears out of the suns glare gracefully          
          alighting on the water perseus helps andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her
          pegasus takes off tilt up with them until they are lost

          the sea is so beautiful it might be mistaken for

          moving over the crowd we push through the flame to find    
          the new ruler of joppa mournful but cloaked in regal      
          dignity and strength  queen andromeda                    

                         cut to

          the ceremony and the heavenly setting

                         perseus
          perseus views the scene from a nearby hill behind him
          pegasus waits patiently grazing the grass until         

                         continued

                         continued
           the equine suddenly whinnies and rears up just as
          quickly pegasus goes silent and bows down perseus          
          looks in that direction to find 
          zeus the prime god of gods an eagle perched on his arm
          he couldnt look more imposing

                         zeus
          am i to understand you do not
          intend to make this union with the
          queen andromeda

                         perseus
          yes

                         zeus
          despite my will and intention that
          you do so

                         perseus
          yes

                         zeus
          would you choose to condemn men
          your own people to suffer more of
          this devastating war

                         perseus
          i have no people you have
          stranded me between realms
          neither man nor god

                         zeus

                         sternly
          do you reproach zeus

                         perseus
          no i thank you father
          zeus mighty god reacts to the word his expression
          softens and he looks on perseus with growing pride

                         perseus
          you have freed me i will not be
          a pawn for men or gods

                         zeus
          does that absolve you suddenly of
          your responsibilities

                         perseus
          youve made me understand that my
          responsibility is to myself so
          it is with us all

                         more

                         intimately
          youve put me to a great test in
          the midst of it i found the
          courage in my heart to defy gods
          i do not know how much of that
          comes from you father and how
          much from my mother who i never
          knew
          zeus starts subtly at the mention of queen danae

                         perseus
          it matters not whatever the
          source i are only grateful
          he looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
          throng

                         perseus
          this war will end the moment you
          choose for it to end and men
          agree i think perhaps that is
          the free will that all realms
          share
          zeus looks at him proud yet wistful  what an
          offspring what a creation!

                         zeus
          what will you do man of free
          will
          perseus motions pegasus forward and swings up onto his
          back

                         perseus
          im going to find vidalia

                         zeus
          so my son you will be a pawn
          for love

                         perseus

                         laughs
          yes father gladly
          perseus spurs pegasus and launches into the sky and
          soars away

          fade out

                         the end
