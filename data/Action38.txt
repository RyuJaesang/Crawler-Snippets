          ext forest  dawn
          
          bare as all hell the trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts some torn violently from their roots and felled
          
          stark gray sunlight shafts between the trees clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything a
          light snow flutters the world monochrome lifeless and cold
          
          a cat prowls across the dead earth barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been its fur mangy and
          rank body ribthin from starvation entirely feral
          
          it moves slowly cautiously sniffing the air scanning the
          forest alert trusting nothing of its surroundings it paces
          across a leafstrewn clearing closing stealthily on
          
          a dead man splayed facedown in the earth his feet bare
          face frozen in a grim death mask a gaping gunshot wound in
          his head the dried blood caked around it matting his hair
          
          as the cat moves closer approaching warily
          
          pov from across the clearing
          
          about thirty yards away someone is watching waiting slow
          deep breaths heard through a gasmask respirator
          
          close on a pair of industrial goggles
          
          the mirrored lenses reflecting the forest clearing locked
          onto the cat the slow metered breathing continues
          
          the cat slows but continues pacing toward the corpse more
          cautious than ever it inches forward sniffing at the body
          
          on the watcher crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves twigs
          and bracken a ghillie suit of the kind used by snipers
          
          the cat sniffs at the dead mans hand frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw the animal still unsure looks
          around again checking its surroundings for predators
          
          the watcher moves almost imperceptibly the leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear  just barely  the
          familiar creaking sound of a bow string being drawn taut
          
          the cat hears it looks up alert staring right at the
          watcher but he is too well camouflaged to be seen an
          interminable tense beat  is the prey going to flee
          
          finally the cat turns its attention back to the carcass
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the mans fingers
          
                                                                  2
          
          
          the watcher looses the arrow it sails across the clearing
          and skewers the cat clean through it drops to the ground
          
          the watcher stands shaking off the ghillie suit revealing
          him to us for the first time
          
          he wears a weatherbeaten kneelength duster hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that torn pants and scuffed work
          boots everything filthy and battered from years of wear
          
          along with the goggles his face remains obscured by a
          disposable paper dust mask and a crudelyfashioned fur hat
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat
          
          around his neck he wears a silver saint christopher pendant
          hanging from a frayed twine cord
          
          his name is eli
          
          he shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow wipes the blood
          from the shaft then reaches down to collect the body
          
          suddenly the cat screeches and flails wildly! eli recoils
          falling backward stunned as the cat  mortally wounded but
          fighting to the death  bites and claws desperately at him
          
          eli struggles violently with the cat wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a hunk of fallen branch he holds the
          writhing animal down and clubs it until it lays still
          
          he sits back breathing harder than the dustmask will allow
          he yanks it down revealing the dirty unshaven face beneath
          impossible to tell his age but certainly not a young man
          
          for a moment he just sits there then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby rucksack which he hauls up onto his back
          
          a canteen dangles from the backpack a shotgun strapped to
          its side eli reaches down for his final possession  an old
          samurai sword in a scabbard which he slings across his back
          
          he gazes up at the sky a snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek he reaches up and brushes it away leaving a black
          smear on his face not snow after all but some kind of ash
          
          ext forest road  day
          
          eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt lined by more of those ghostly strippedbare trees
          
                                                                    3
          
          
          he sniffs the air breathing it in checks the road in both
          directions deserted a few yards away is the rusted burned
          out chassis of a car he heads toward it
          
          the car rests half on the road half in the adjacent ditch
          stripped of its tires and engine in the drivers seat is a
          mummified body a bullet hole piercing its forehead
          
          eli regards the body dispassionately tries the door handle
          but its jammed he yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open he leans in and checks the mans feet
          
          theyre bare no shoes or socks eli curses under his breath
          
          he leaves the car behind and heads on down the road as he
          walks away we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose held in place now only by a rubber band
          
          ext road  day
          
          eli continues down the road he ambles along slowly a man in
          no hurry a man who has been walking a long time
          
          the road has since emerged from the forest passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk
          
          the sun beats down from directly overhead the sky has no
          color to it paperwhite the unfiltered suns stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleachedout overexposed
          
          crane up as eli walks on on the horizon is the silhouette of
          a city or what was once a city columns of black smoke rise
          from within casting a deathly pall over the skyline burned
          and broken skyscrapers jut out like tombstones
          
          eli reaches a fork in the road and stops the road hes on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon the other fork continues on into the wasteland
          
          after a brief pause eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork away from the city
          
          ext abandoned town  day
          
          little more than a main street lined with storefronts eli
          walks steadily along sidestepping rubble and debris
          ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street
          
          he passes by abandoned stores every one picked clean empty
          shelves smashed windows looted and burned he doesnt even
          look inside knowing already that he will find nothing
          
          until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop an old
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze
          
                                                                    4
          
          
                    eds shoes  gentlemens and ladies footwear
          
          he steps into the doorway and pushes open the door it swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust
          
          int shoe store  continuous
          
          eli steps inside like all the others the store has been
          cleaned out shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor the whole place reeking of dead musty air
          
          eli looks around just to be sure drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them nothing
          
          as he turns back for the door his foot nudges against a shoe
          box its not empty he crouches down flips the lid off
          hopefully and pulls out a ladys highheeled shoe
          
          he strokes the shoe leather with his hand shakes his head
          grimly then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves
          
          ext abandoned house  day
          
          on the outskirts of town in disrepair  peeling paint
          broken windows dampstained walls  but habitable
          
          eli stands in the front yard surrounded by brownish
          overgrown weeds thinking it over turns to face the setting
          sun it will be dark soon he turns back toward the house
          
          int abandoned house  day
          
          the front door is sent crashing open with a hard kick
          revealing eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight the shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready he moves inside
          
          another dead place flies buzzing in the still dank air
          everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved an eerie snapshot of a world long gone
          
          kitchen
          
          every cupboard empty eli checks each one poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword but finds nothing but dust
          
          he opens the freezer checks inside empty save for a small
          icebox the lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open
          
          inside are the wizened petrified remains of a human hand
          floating in slimy discolored water the smell vile and thick
          enough to make eli retch he quickly jams the lid back on
          
                                                                  5
          
          
          bedroom
          
          a wooden bedframe stripped clean the dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor eli moves
          toward a large walkin closet and opens the door
          
          no clothes inside  just the nearfossilized corpse of a man
          hanging by a noose twisting gently back and forth
          
          unfazed eli crouches down and checks the mans feet an old
          pair of converse allstars hang limp from the mans skeletal
          ankles eli calmly sets about unlacing them
          
          he checks the size theyre a fit he upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers laces them up
          
          he walks around pacing up and down getting a feel for the
          new shoes they feel good for the first time he smiles
          
          later
          
          eli sits in the corner roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small campfire he cleans the animals pelts as he
          watches it cook pokes at the meat with a penknife checking
          it for doneness it appears ready to eat
          
          he clasps his hands together in prayer
          
                              eli
                    dear lord thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast
          
          he speaks quietly his voice barely above a whisper even so
          we catch the accent  a raspy oldworld midwest drawl like
          john wayne or some other longforgotten western icon
          
                              eli

          he signs a cross over himself then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat takes a bite savoring the taste with great
          relish to him its gradea filet mignon
          
                                                                  6

                    hey you hungry
          
          it appears as though he is talking to himself until a rat
          emerges from his coat pocket whiskers twitching keenly eli
          offers it some meat the rat gnaws enthusiastically at it
          
          sundown
          
          the last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedrooms
          broken window eli rummages through his backpack pulls out a
          small package wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string
          
          he sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it its an
          old leatherbound book the binding cracked and pages dog
          eared thumbed through a thousand times and more
          
          eli gazes lovingly at it lets his fingers play across the
          beatup old leather cover a cherished thing
          
          he begins to read halfhidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight silently mouthing the words as he reads them
          
          many pages later
          
          eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before
          replaces it in his pack then reaches in for something else
          
          a car battery old and streaked with acid stains attached to
          a tangled bunch of electrical wiring and jumper cables eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces
          
          an ipod badly beatup the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape but functional eli attaches the battery
          cable to the ipod and places the headphones in his ears
          
          the music plays mozarts piano concerto no 20 in d minor
          eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up
          
          the music swells elis fingers dance and swoop in the air
          as though conducting an orchestra as he is transported by
          the music to another world a world far from this one
          
          morning
          
          sunlight shafts through the window eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position headphones still in his ears asleep
          
          the rat scurries up elis chest and licks his face slowly
          he wakes realizing he fell asleep with his music still on
          checks the battery its dead drained overnight he frowns
          
          he gets to his feet moves to the window and checks outside
          all seems quiet he loads up his backpack and weapons
          
                                                                  7

                    come on now
          
          the rat scurries up his leg onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket eli turns and moves out
          
          ext abandoned house  morning
          
          the gate squeaks shut behind eli as he exits the front yard
          
          he breathes in the air turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face then turns away from it and walks on down the road
          
          ext road  day
          
          the landscape barren and featureless road lined with dead
          trees eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt
          
          the road is strewn with burnedout cars and debris from a
          world long dead a warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads litter removal next two miles by circuit city
          
          up ahead is a hunched figure by the side of the road eli
          arrives to see that its a young woman bonethin dressed in
          filthy rags skin plagued by an unpleasant rash
          
          the shopping cart she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch spilling its contents blankets tins of
          food old clothes shes on her knees trying to gather it up
          
          she looks up as she sees eli approaching instantly cowers
          from him raising her hands to protect herself terrified
          
                              young woman
                    oh please dont hurt me here
                    take anything you want you want
                    some food take it
          
          she offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand eli
          stands there looking at her his expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles
          
                              eli
                    im not going to hurt you

                    thats what the last guys said
          
          eli bends down and picks up a couple of the carts spilled
          contents steps forward and offers them to her
          
                              eli
                    here
          
                                                                    8
          
          
          she blinks unsure cautiously she reaches out and takes it
          
                              young woman
                    could you help me the wheel came
                    off i cant fix it maybe if i
                    could get it out of the ditch but
                    i cant
          
          eli looks at the cart it has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a thick bracken hedgerow that lines the road
          
          he looks again at the girl her faded blouse is unbuttoned
          revealing a little cleavage her skirt torn along the leg
          showing more than a little thigh almost deliberate
          
          he sniffs the air watches the hedgerow warily just like the
          cat he hunted his senses heightened and on alert
          
          behind the hedge three roadside bandits are crouched
          waiting to pounce each armed with a crude blunt weapon they
          exchange anxious looks
          
          eli sniffs the air again  then backs away from the girl
          
                              eli
                    one good thing about no soap any
                    more you can smell the road agents
                    a mile off
          
          the girls face falls as eli backs up the three bandits
          emerge from the hedgerow brandishing their weapons a couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to elis
          
          the bandit leader grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes yanking her painfully to her feet
          
                              bandit leader
                    dumb bitch what did we tell you
          
          he pushes her away she crumples to the road in a heap
          
          eli backs away but two more armed bandits drop from hiding
          in the trees behind cutting off his escape surrounding him
          
                              bandit leader
                    what you got there in the pack
          
                               eli

          bandit #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack
          
                              bandit #2
                    hes got a gun

                    i cant do that
          
          the bandit leader steps forward aggressively now within
          striking distance of eli he grins teeth filthy and rotten
          
                              bandit leader

                    hacked your fucking arms off
          
          eli remains perfectly calm and though he speaks with a soft
          even tone there is something formidable about his voice
          
                              eli

          beat the bandit leader looks at eli incredulously and
          then laughs the other bandits laugh along nervously
          
                              bandit leader
                    what the hell are you some kinda

                    ground
          
                                                                 10
          
          
          eli doesnt move doesnt say a word the bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder
          
                              bandit leader
                    you fucking listening to me
          
                              eli
                    i hear you you lay that hand on me
                    again and you will not get it back
          
          the other bandits exchange nervous looks this is not how
          its supposed to go
          
                              bandit leader
                    all right i had just about enough
                    of this shit
          
          he lunges forward grabs the shoulder strap of elis pack
          
          if you blinked you missed it but somehow eli has now drawn
          his sword a rivulet of blood snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt
          
          bandit leaders hand is still gripped firmly around elis
          shoulder strap but its no longer connected to his arm the
          severed hand hangs there from the strap dripping blood
          
          bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was looks at it in shock and horror
          
                              bandit leader
                    what you just he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! my fucking hand!
          
          eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leaders legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt his eyes dart around as though confused
          
                              bandit leader
                    what you standin around for kiss
                    him!
          
                              bandit #3
                    whats he talkin about kiss him
          
                              eli
                    hes in shock he means kill him
          
          a tense beat and then the four remaining bandits attack eli
          all at once weapons flailing
          
          eli flourishes the sword a blur too fast to follow but
          its clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill
          
                                                                    11
          
          
          it is over in moments the four bandits lay slain in the
          road blood pooling out onto the asphalt
          
          the bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand a few yards
          away eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach
          
                               eli
                    i told you you wouldnt be getting
                    that back
          
          bandit leader looks up to see the figure of eli bearing down
          on him silhouetted ominously against the sun he looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel something not of this world
          
                              bandit leader
                    who are you
          
                              eli
                    my name is eli
          
          and with that eli runs him through with his sword
          
          he turns to see the young woman slumped in the road sobbing
          she cowers again as he approaches certain that she is next
          
          he walks past her sheathes his sword then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it the woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart
          
                              eli
                    take it and go on your way and
                    dont fall in with men like these
                    again no good can come
          
          she looks at him puzzled
          
                              young woman
                    why are you doing this
          
          eli says nothing walks back to the slain bandits crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies
          
          he takes a scarf from around the neck of one finds a zippo
          lighter on another checks that it works and pockets it
          
          later
          
          the five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch halfcovered
          with dirt the best burial they are going to get
          
          eli stands before them head bowed in prayer he speaks
          quietly and quickly a speech he has given many times
          
                                                                   12
          
          
                              eli
                    god the father of mercies through
                    the death and resurrection of his
                    son has reconciled the world to
                    himself and sent the holy spirit
                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins
          
          the young woman stands a few yards away watching him
          transfixed she has never seen anyone like him
          
                              eli
                    through the ministry of the church
                    may he give you pardon and peace
                    and i absolve you from your sins in
                    the name of the father and of the
                    son and of the holy spirit amen
          
          he turns and walks away down the road passing the woman
          
                              young woman
                    thank you youre a good man
          
                              eli
                    there are no good men on the road
          
                              young woman
                    where are you going
          
                              eli
                    west
          
                              young woman
                    can can i come with you
          
          he doesnt even turn back to look at her
          
                              eli
                    no
          
          he walks on into the horizon
          
          ext freeway overpass  day
          
          straddling the desert like a giant crumbling monument to a
          longdead civilization eli steadily climbs his way up
          
          he comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has collapsed at midpoint rusted iron rods jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed
          
          eli just stands there at the edge for a moment feeling the
          wind whip around him his coat fluttering in the breeze
          
                                                                 13
          
          
          the overpasss collapsed section is now just a mountainous
          pile of rubble that leads down to the road below
          
          eli steps onto the rubble about to make his way down when he
          freezes he hears something the faintest of sounds he takes
          cover peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see
          
          two people walking together on the road we see everything
          from elis pov  too far to make out much detail but
          apparently it is a middleaged couple
          
          the man pushes along an old wheelbarrow covered by a tarp as
          the woman seemingly his wife walks alongside the barrows
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive rhythmic squeak
          
          eli ducks down again as he hears something else this time
          much louder the menacing growl of motorcycle engines
          
          four bikes in total riding out of the horizon closing in on
          the couple they see the bikes coming and panic try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road
          
          the bikes screech to a halt and the four riders dismount
          brandishing a variety of weapons the couple make a run for
          it but theyre quickly chased down and tackled to the ground
          
          the woman screams and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals
          
          the woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her eli turns away he knows what comes next
          
          eli listens as the woman screams and screams he reaches for
          his shotgun hesitates then withdraws his hand
          
                              eli
                    it aint your concern stay on the
                    path it aint your concern stay
                    on the path
          
          eli repeats it like a mantra he clearly wants to intervene
          but will not permit himself to instead he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help and
          then finally suddenly is silenced
          
          down below the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt the bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow spilling its contents onto the asphalt
          
          they ferret through the items scavenging a few items  we
          dont see what  and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel
          they leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came dust pluming in their wake
          
                                                                 14
          
          
          eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place
          
          ext road beneath overpass  day
          
          eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple he signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath then stands and continues on down the road
          
          ext road fork  day
          
          more desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see the road
          forks again here eli arrives at the junction and stops
          
          the road eli is on leads further into the west the other
          fork heads toward a small town just visible on the horizon
          
          a handpainted sign has been driven into the dirt nearby no
          words just a series of crude pictograms a bed a plate of
          food a water faucet an arrow points toward the town
          
          eli pauses thinking it over retrieves the ipod from his
          pocket clicks the button but no response he sighs
          
          he turns and heads down the other fork toward town
          
          ext desert town  outskirts  day
          
          a primitive sprawling village of tents and barnlike
          structures built from corrugated iron rotted wood molded
          plastic tarpaulin  materials scavenged from the old world
          
          huddled residents are dressed in little more than rags many
          wearing goggles like elis to shield their eyes from the sun
          
          eli stands at the edge of town reluctant to enter but he
          braces himself and walks on in and as he rounds a corner
          entering the center of town an astonishing sight
          
          ext desert town  main street  continuous
          
          the broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials the asphalt
          street warped and cracked parking meters bent and smashed
          
          its a lot like the abandoned town eli passed through
          earlier except very much alive  bustling with townsfolk
          
          its at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight  like an
          old norman rockwell painting of classic smalltown america
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse an
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new
          
                                                                 15
          
          
          the centerpiece of the town is a grand theater at the head of
          the main street the palladium like the rest of the town
          badly damaged and shoddily fixedup but still standing
          
          eli walks down the street and approaches a blacksmith
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store
          
                              eli
                    you got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here
          
          the blacksmith doesnt look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street
          
                              eli
                    thanks
          
          eli heads down the street stopping when he comes across a
          statue erected in the center of the road a tall man crudely
          fashioned in clay one hand placed paternally on the head of
          a small child the other outstretched toward the sun
          
          as he observes the statue eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to pause and genuflect before it worshipping
          
          curious eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statues
          face then hears shuffling feet behind him and turns as a
          parade of emaciated men and women trudges past roped
          together at the waist each man leading the one behind
          
          heads shaved thin from malnutrition and each one blind
          they gaze at the ground with pale dead eyes they carry
          picks shovels and other tools  a sightless chain gang
          
          eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past herded like
          cattle by a brutish chain gang boss who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction
          
                              chain gang boss
                    come on move it!
          
          the gang boss glares at eli as he passes by eli doesnt
          return the look just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a lightning bolt suspended above the door
          
          int engineer workshop  continuous
          
          whatever this place once was its now a kind of post
          apocalyptic radio shack shelves display a variety of goods
          engine parts old electrical wiring small appliances
          
          an old electric generator rumbles noisily powering strings
          of multicolored christmas lights that hang all around
          
                                                                  16
          
          
          behind the main counter a convoluted rube goldbergesque
          still is running an engineer in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the stills funnel
          
          attached to the still is an old motorcycle mirror in its
          reflection the engineer sees eli checking out the store
          
          without turning around he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something
          
          eli turns toward the counter  to find the engineer training
          a pumpaction shotgun right at him
          
                              engineer
                    i dont know you
          
          eli slowly raises his hands
          
                              eli
                    im not from around here

                              engineer
                    a customer with a shotgun
          
          he nods toward the shotgun visible on elis backpack
          
                              engineer
                    you come in here to rip me off
          
          the engineers hands tremble his finger tight on the
          trigger this man needs to be talked down carefully
          
                              eli
                    no ill set it down okay
          
                              engineer
                    slowly!
          
          eli nods unhitches the pack and sets it down steps away
          
                              engineer
                    you carry a gun in the outland you

                              eli

          this seems to make the engineer more suspicious of eli
          
                              engineer
                    show me your hand

                    im not a
          
          the engineer jerks the shotgun at eli nervously
          
                              engineer
                    i said show me your fucking hand!
          
          eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched palm faced
          downward the engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors but elis hand stays steady as a rock
          
                              eli
                    im not one of them
          
          the sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little finally he lowers the shotgun
          
                              engineer
                    what do you want

                    my pack okay
          
          the engineer raises the shotgun nervously again
          
                              eli
                    i know i know slowly
          
          the engineer watches him like a hawk as eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery when he sees it he gasps
          
                                 engineer
                    holy shit
          
          eli places it on the counter the engineer looks it over with
          awe like its a priceless historical artifact
          
                              engineer

          eli pulls the zippo lighter from his pocket the engineer
          picks it up sparks the flint watches the flame flicker
          
                              engineer
                    itll take a couple hours theres

          int palladium  auditorium  day
          
          this once grand theater have been largely gutted  seats torn
          out fixtures and fittings stripped curtains ripped from the
          stage but still theres a sense of grandeur to this place
          
          looking out over the stage a royal box  once the most
          prestigious seat in the house  has been converted into an
          office of sorts seats removed and replaced by an ornate
          mahogany desk facing inward a chandelier suspended above it
          
          the whole setup is gaudy and ostentatious  the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth but
          has no taste whatsoever
          
          a tall man is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk deeply involved in an old paperback book
          
          the books cover is faded and partially torn away the title
          still just visible 7 habits of highly effective people
          
                                                                   19
          
          
          the man is older than most weve seen his skin weathered by
          the elements and by a long lifes experience one of the very
          few people weve seen in this world close to elis age  and
          unlike everyone else weve seen he appears healthy and well
          groomed a rich mane of hair full set of teeth
          
          he wears a tattered suit and tie none of it matches
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras but he
          looks almost civilized respectable his name is carnegie
          
          he looks up from his book at the sound of a polite cough os
          
          redridge stands before him tall powerfully built
          
                              carnegie
                    what is it
          
          his accent is like caramel a rich deepsouth drawl

                    inspection it aint good
          
          carnegie lowers his book concerned
          
                              carnegie
                    how bad is it

                    pressure is down again and going
                    by the new rod they sank levelsre
                    lower than theyve ever been
          
          carnegie stands thinking this is bad news
          
                                carnegie
                    how long

          beat carnegie stares redridge down nobody but nobody
          questions his orders
          
                                                                 20
          
          
                              redridge
                    youre going to have to say
                    something folks were none too
                    happy last time gonna be worse
                    now you can count on it
          
          carnegie sighs rubs his brow he knows redridge is right
          
          ext desert town  main street  day
          
          a large crowd of townsfolk  several hundred strong  has
          assembled outside the palladium theater an armed crew of
          carnegies goons keeps watch over the crowd
          
          carnegie stands on a balcony above the theater marquee he
          treats the balcony like a pulpit speaking through a
          microphone connected to an old pa system that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd
          
                              carnegie
                    i want you all to remember how far
                    weve come together and how far we
                    still can go if only we believe
                    when i brought us here to this
                    oasis  this promised land  we
                    knew there would be hardships knew
                    there would be sacrifices but we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders
          
          the crowd listens intently hanging on carnegies every word
          he is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker  his
          cultivated image and inspiring confident delivery remind us
          of a television evangelist
          
                              carnegie
                    and i want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town but faith
          
          this sends a murmur of discontent through the crowd many
          dont like where they suspect this may be going carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric  delivering it now
          with the firebrand passion of an oldtime baptist preacher
          
                              carnegie
                    it is our faith that sustains us
                    brothers and sisters! hallelujah!
          
                                                                 21
          
          
          the crowd is divided many return the hallelujah with
          varying levels of conviction others are not convinced but
          carnegie continues unabated selling it harder than ever
          
                              carnegie
                    and mark me the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    the sacred word of our lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor bring
                    it nourishment bring it new life!
                    for the almighty himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
          
          carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker its
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words his apparently unshakable belief is infectious
          
                               carnegie
                    in the meantime he has asked us
                    all to be patient to walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer and to do that we must
                    give just a little more
                        beat
                    water rations will be halved until
                    further notice
          
          this sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd  this news has not been received well at all some
          still keep the faith but many more are perturbed by this
          
          carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down
          
                              carnegie
                    i understand your frustration the
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one  but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory
                    beyond anything you can imagine
          
          a discontented villager steps forward pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at carnegie
          
                              discontented villager
                    weve heard this all before! when
                    are you going to
          
          carnegies goons quickly move in and efficiently silence the
          man removing him from the crowd dissent is not tolerated
          here carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened
          
                                                                 22
          
          
                               carnegie
                    i know each and every one of you
                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action it was faith that
                    built this town  and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead but
                    it is always darkest before dawn 
                    and the new dawn is coming
                        beat
                    may god go with you all
          
          carnegie steps back inside leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves clearly mixed about what they have heard
          
          as the assembled townsfolk disperse four motorcycles roar
          into town and pull up outside the palladium
          
          as the riders dismount one detaches a cloth satchel from his
          bikes cargo rack the four riders head inside they each
          have long straggly hair and brutish expressions
          
          we recognize them now as the biker bandits who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass
          
          int palladium  second floor  day
          
          carnegie emerges into the secondfloor hallway from the
          balcony mopping his brow exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display and from its mixed reception
          
          redridge climbs the stairs to meet him
          
                               redridge
                    one of the road crews just rolled
                    into town
          
          carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch
          
                              carnegie
                    of course they did the bars open
                    outlanders always looking for
                    answers at the bottom of a bottle
          
                               redridge
                    not these guys
                        beat
                    these guys say they got something
          
          that gets carnegies attention
          
                              carnegie
                    get them up here now
          
                                                                 23
          
          
          int palladium  main lobby  day
          
          what was once a grand gilded entrance foyer has like the
          rest of the theater been largely gutted but its still
          impressive  a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor entrance to balcony seats etc
          faded old theater posters still hang from the walls
          
          the place has been shabbily converted into a kind of saloon
          old rippedout theater seats arranged around tables a
          fireplace sputters dimly
          
          a mangy tabby cat walks across the strawladen floor a dozen
          or so customers in the place a mixed roughlooking bunch
          
          redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his men who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs
          
          int palladium auditorium  carnegies box
          
          carnegie checks his reflection in a cracked hand mirror
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back he adjusts his tie
          as redridges men usher the bikers into his office
          
          carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them just as
          when he gave his balcony address carnegie is in performance
          mode  charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician
          
                              carnegie
                    gentlemen! its truly a delight to
                    see you again! i understand your
                    latest excursion into the outland
                    has been a profitable one
          
          the bikers exchange looks they understood maybe half the
          words in that sentence the lead biker  named hog  speaks
          
                              hog
                    we did good
          
                              carnegie
                    well lets see shall we
          
          hog tips the satchels contents out onto carnegies desk
          
          books about a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
          sizes carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection
          
          we see various titles as he sorts through them treasure
          island the da vinci code a volume of encyclopedia the
          diary of anne frank tuesdays with morrie
          
          in amongst the books are a few magazines an old issue of
          oprah magazine a torn copy of sports illustrated
          
                                                                 24
          
          
          and a newsweek the cover graphic illustrates opposing
          nuclear arsenals over a world globe on one side the stars
          and stripes on the other flags indicating a sinoislamic
          alliance the headline reads is there no turning back
          
                              carnegie
                    no no no no no
          
          as carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
          frustration its clear hes looking for a specific volume
          
                              carnegie
                    its not here
          
                              hog
                    these aint worth nothin
          
                              carnegie
                    when you bring me the book i asked
                    you for itll be worth something
          
          the bikers exchange more looks an unspoken conversation
          
                              hog
                    we been doin this a long time now

                    want us to keep at it reckon its
                    worth more than a few free glasses
                    of that swill you call liquor
          
          carnegies guards bristle ready for a confrontation
          carnegie just smiles always ready to smooth things over
          
                              carnegie
                    gentlemen gentlemen i urge you
                    once again to take the long view

                    world far greater far more

                    masters of all creation!
          
          as always his carefully stagemanaged rhetoric is delivered
          with the utmost conviction every word dripping with passion
          and persuasion hes a master salesman a true huckster
          
                              carnegie
                    and you know i think youre
                    absolutely right

                                                                 25
          
                              carnegie contd
                    that is worth more than a few
                    glasses of liquor a whole lot
                    more
          
          he steps forward and looks hog right in the eye his gaze
          like a laser beam utterly disarming
          
                              carnegie
                    the book i want is out there
                    somewhere just waiting to be

                    promise you you will be rewarded
                    beyond anything you can imagine
          
          its impossible not to be swayed by this guy hes just so
          full of fiery passion and infectious belief you almost want
          to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet
          
          hog snatches up his empty satchel
          
                              hog
                    this better not be bullshit
          
          he turns and marches to the door the other bikers following
          the guards escort them out only redridge remains
          
          carnegie slumps back into his chair frustrated pissed off
          
                              redridge
                    might help if they knew just what
                    they were looking for
          
                              carnegie
                    not one of them can read how would
                    they even know when they found it
          
                              redridge
                    so hows about you just tell me
          
          carnegie and redridge lock eyes beat
          
                              redridge
                    two years now you been sending
                    these crews into the outland
                    burning up gas we can barely spare
                    for a goddamn book what the hell
                    kinda book can be worth all this
          
          carnegie ignores him stands walks toward the door redridge
          sighs gestures toward the books piled on carnegies desk
          
                                                                 26
          
          
                              redridge
                    what about these
          
                              carnegie
                    put them with the others
          
          int palladium  main lobby  day
          
          redridge stands by the marble fireplace tossing the books
          into the fire the flames flicker and leap around the books
          as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire
          
          int engineer workshop  day
          
          eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
          generator which chugs noisily
          
          he licks his lips dry as sand unscrews his canteen to take
          a drink but its down to its last few drips
          
                              eli
                    whats this place across the
                    street they got any water
          
                              engineer
                    we got our own underground spring
                    here only fresh water in a hundred
                    miles  ifs you can pay for it
          
          eli thinks a while longer then stands and stuffs his shotgun
          inside his pack shoulders his gear and makes for the door
          
                              eli
                    ill be back
          
          eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer
          
                              eli
                    if that battery aint here when i
                    get back i will use this gun on
                    your kneecaps and i will put this
                    building to the torch and i will
                    watch it burn to the ground with
                    you alive inside it so help me
                    god
          
          and with that he turns and leaves the engineer gulps not a
          hint in elis voice that he didnt mean every word
          
          int palladium  carnegies bedroom  day
          
          this old secondfloor dressing room has been converted into a
          bedroom simply furnished
          
                                                                   27
          
          
          a woman stands in front of an old dressing room mirror the
          bulbs around the frame burnedout and broken she washes her
          face in murky water in an old porcelain bowl on the dresser
          
          her name is claudia early 30s pretty she gazes into the
          mirror as she dries her hands but its so cracked and warped
          its near impossible to see a reflection
          
          the door opens and carnegie enters he still looks steamed
          claudia doesnt turn to look at him keeps facing the mirror
          
                              claudia
                    is that you honey
          
          carnegie says nothing just paces angrily up and down
          finally claudia turns to face him
          
                              claudia
                    something wrong
          
                              carnegie
                    more books came in from the road
                    today
          
                              claudia
                    oh its been a while
          
                              carnegie
                    and itll be a while longer just
                    another pile of useless junk if we
                    dont find the right one soon  if
                    i cant give these people what they
                    want to hear

          he puts his hands on her lustfully its clear shes not in
          the mood but she halfheartedly responds anyway more out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion
          
          as they kiss carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants
          
          int palladium  main lobby  day
          
          the original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshinetype liquor from a shared jar
          
          eli enters all eyes are on him immediately regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar
          
          the bartender approaches looks him up and down suspicious

          eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar the bartender
          takes it and looks it over not particularly impressed
          
                              bartender
                    thatll get you maybe halfway
          
          the bartender spies elis silver saint christopher pendant
          
                              bartender
                    what about that
          
          eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt no way thats for
          sale instead he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat lays them out on the bar
          
                              eli
                    thats the best i got
          
          the bartender takes a pelt and examines it the mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and hisses at eli
          
          eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand at the
          bikers table hog watches this not happy about this
          
          satisfied with the pelts the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf then turns away toward the back room
          
                              bartender
                    solara!
          
          a teenage girl emerges from the back no older than 16 or 17
          dressed in unflattering work clothes face grimy blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail but even through all this its
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman
          
          the bartender takes elis canteen and hands it to solara
          along with a ration card he keeps around his neck
          
                                                                 30
          
          
                              bartender
                    take this out back and get it
                    filled
          
          solara takes the canteen pausing for a moment to look eli up
          and down unsure quite what to make of him but intrigued
          theres something about him she cant put her finger on
          
          he doesnt look back at her she turns and exits
          
          ext desert town  main street  continuous
          
          solara exits via the palladiums stage door and walks across
          the busy street to where two of carnegies armed men stand
          guard around an enclosure of chainlink fence topped with
          razor wire townsfolk wait in line with bowls and buckets
          
          one of the guards recognizes solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line he punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chainlink enclosure
          
          inside is an old rusted spigot attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth solara cranks hard on the handle  it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes and then only at a weak
          trickle it will take a while to fill the canteen
          
          int palladium  main lobby  continuous
          
          as eli sits at the bar a shadow comes into view and looms
          large over him hog is standing behind him glaring cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers
          
          solara senses trouble brewing and moves off taking elis
          canteen away into the back room
          
                              hog
                    that was my cat
          
          eli doesnt turn just looks straight ahead impossible to
          read him behind those mirrored goggles utterly inscrutable
          
                              eli
                    fine specimen

                                                                 31
          
          
                              eli
                    sorry it wont happen again
          
          the bartender looks at hog nervously
          
                              bartender
                    hey how about another drink hog

                    i dont want any trouble
          
          hog grabs him by the arm
          
                              hog
                    well thats too bad cause
          
          blink suddenly hogs head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than elis thumb pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck eli leans in close as hog whimpers paralyzed
          
                              eli
                    i know you murderer of innocent

                    to spend eternity drowning in a

                    youve done did you know that
          
          the other bikers stand and approach the other customers
          following suit eli senses the trouble gathering behind him
          
                              eli
                    you go on back to your table and
                    ill be on my way all right
          
          its all hog can do to just barely nod his head eli releases
          his thumb hog staggers backward gasping for breath
          
          eli stands and makes toward the door but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit
          
                              burly patron
                    you push hog you push all of us
          
          eli sighs looks down at the floor hes been pushed one time
          too many today for the first time we see anger in his face
          
                                                                    32

                    taken for dust you are
          
          the patrons look at eli strangely who is this guy
          
          eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword carves a line
          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade
          
                              eli

          bunched around his ankles ass bared as he pounds away at
          her not making love this is mechanical loveless sex
          
          claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
          carnegie thrusts into her again and again deeply
          uninterested just waiting for it to be over
          
          suddenly we hear a crash os carnegie stops and listens
          
                              carnegie
                    did you hear that what was that
          
          claudia sees an opening to get out of this
          
                              claudia
                    maybe you should go check

                    what in the hell is going on
          
          he pulls up his pants grabbing a rifle propped by the door
          as he rushes out claudia just stands there for a moment
          then reaches down and pulls up her panties
          
          she moves from the wall and makes her way across the room
          feeling her way with her hands gazing off into nothingness
          only now do we finally realize that she is blind
          
          int palladium  main lobby  continuous
          
          carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony looks
          down over the railing  and is stunned by what he sees
          
                                                                 33
          
          
          chaos in the bar below eli cutting a oneman swath of mayhem
          through the dozen brawlers most already lie dead two more
          men attack eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword
          
          carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing banging loudly
          on the doors of the upstairs rooms
          
                              carnegie

          on eli surrounded by the dead only one man left standing
          hog he backs away as eli circles him like a predator sword
          held ready the blade glistening with dark red blood
          
          solara reemerges from the back room with elis refilled
          canteen she stops and emits a horrified gasp when she sees
          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her
          
          she watches mortified as eli moves toward the helpless
          terrified hog going in for the kill raising his sword
          
          suddenly solara steps forward and cries out
          
                                 solara
                    stop!
          
          eli freezes sword hanging in the air poised to strike he
          turns his head to where solara stands behind the bar

                    please dont
          
          beat as eli considers he looks back at hog still completely
          at his mercy and then lowers the sword
          
                                 eli
                    go

          hog stumbles backward through the door into the sunlight
          eli moves toward solara who stands petrified behind the bar
          reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip
          
                                 eli
                    thank you

          in the exitway hog turns back inside grabbing up a broken
          bottle from the bloody floor as he goes
          
          hog rushes eli from behind solara sees him coming and goes
          to scream  but before any sound can come eli flips his
          sword backward and hog runs right onto it skewering himself
          
          beat hog just stands there for a moment eyes wide frozen
          in shock his fingers go limp dropping the bottle
          
          he slides off the sword and collapses to the floor dead
          
          eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it looks around at
          the bloodied fallen bodies then back at solara

          accompanied by the sound of multiple guns cocking

                              carnegie
                    it means we have laws here laws
                    set down long before any of us ever

          eli doesnt respond just stands there in carnegies gaze

                    come here looking for trouble
          
          barely noticeable carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves
          
                              carnegie

                    youd never guess half the men who
                    built it were blind a small
                    tribute from a grateful people i
                    was deeply touched
          
                                                                 36

          the desk toward eli waves an admonishing finger at him
          
                              carnegie

          element spinning the argument his way pitching selling
          
                               carnegie
                    in the outland the sightless are
                    preyed upon like sick animals here

                    the essential work others dont
                    want and in return they eat they
                    drink they survive last year a
                    couple of them even got married

          an impressive impassioned performance he sounds just like
          an oldschool tv evangelist but eli is unmoved

          the gunmen bristle exchange nervous looks carnegie appears
          unfazed he smiles beat he looks to the gunman at the door
          
                              carnegie
                    let him go
          
          the gunman opens the door eli turns and exits
          
          int engineer workshop  day
          
          the engineer stands behind the counter looking worried his
          heart sinks when he sees eli enter
          
                              engineer
                    oh shit

                    town pick it up in the morning
          
          eli leans in a little closer he smells a rat
          
                                                                    39
          
          
                              eli
                    you remember what i said would
                    happen if i came back here and you
                    didnt have my battery

                    take a while longer i swear
          
          eli looks at the engineer hard to be certain but hes
          pretty sure hes lying somebody got to him
          
          int palladium auditorium  carnegies box
          
          a violent commotion is heard from down the hall suddenly one
          of carnegies henchmen comes flying into view as he is thrown
          hard into a wall and slumps to the floor unconscious
          
          eli storms into the box pissed more guards rush in behind
          him carnegie seated behind his desk waves the guards off
          as he stands to greet eli smiling ingratiatingly as ever
          
                              carnegie
                    i knew youd reconsider

                    those years out there alone on the
                    road some with their brains half
                    fried from eating each other  its
                    understandable why you people
                    arent the brightest bulbs in the
                    box but i never met one so dumb
                    that hed turn down a meal and a
                    bed if it was offered
          
                              eli
                    so you didnt send someone across
                    the street to the engineer
          
                              carnegie
                    engineer i dont know what youre
                    talking about if theres something
                    wrong maybe i can help
          
          carnegie is a practiced liar much more difficult to read
          
                                                                 40

                    this is redridge hes kind of my
                    righthand man around here
          
          redridge  one of the two men who chased eli into the room 
          steps forward he regards eli with a distrustful eye
          
                              carnegie
                    hell show you to your room
          
          int palladium  guest bedroom  dusk
          
          redridge opens the door and ushers eli inside
          
          its another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom
          less wellappointed than carnegies own a threadbare rug
          bed with relatively clean sheets a sink for washing
          
                              redridge
                    enjoy your stay therell be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night if you need anything
          
          redridge smirks and closes the door leaving eli alone eli
          paces across the room finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here
          
          he unshoulders his pack sets it down lies down on the bed
          its been a while since he felt a real bed on his back
          
          a knock at the door eli gets quickly to his feet
          
                              eli
                    hello
          
          the door opens and claudia enters carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and atop that a dinner tray
          
                              claudia
                    i have this for you water for
                    washing and some food
          
          eli just stands there totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation its been too long she smiles embarrassed

          he takes the stuff from her sets it on the table
          
                                                                 41
          
          
                              claudia
                    youre very welcome
          
          we get the impression that claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as eli but she likes it
          
                              claudia
                    itll be dark soon
          
          she strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table the
          room is lit by its flickering glow
          
                              claudia
                    can i get you anything else
          
                              eli
                    no thank you
          
                              claudia
                    well have a good night
          
          as she turns for the door
          
                              eli
                    youre carnegies woman

                    while not a real one leastways
          
          claudia smiles neither has she
          
                              claudia
                    he found me in the outland i was
                    sixteen my family had been

                    id met some men on the road bad
                    men they
          
          beat she trails off struggling with this unhappy memory
          eli gets it raises a hand reassuringly
          
                              eli
                    its all right
          
                                                                  42
          
          
                              claudia
                    i was on the road for a year after
                    that i couldnt feed myself let
                    alone my little girl and then bill
                    found us and he promised hed take
                    care of us he told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe and he did he did all that
                    he built this whole town he kept
                    us safe and he raised that child
                    like she was his own hes been so
                    good to both of us he saved us
                    really
          
          theres a bittersweet quality to claudias words as though
          there is more to the story than she is telling
          
          eli pulls out a chair at the table offers it to her
          
                              eli
                    you want to eat some
          
          she smiles and sits eli sits across from her
          
                              eli
                    when did you go blind in the war
                    you get caught in a flash
          
                              claudia
                    no i was born this way i think
                    im lucky like that
          
                              eli
                    lucky
          
                              claudia
                    its not like i ever knew what im
                    missing i was already used to
                    being like this by the time by
                    the time it all happened so i got
                    around pretty good even when i was
                    on my own and now its easy i
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here and its not like i ever go
                    any place else bill would never
                    allow it he worries about me so
                    much
          
          again bittersweet the sense that claudia feels trapped
          thinking about it begins to upset her she gets up
          
                              claudia
                    i should go hell be wondering
                    where i am
          
                                                                 43
          
          
          eli stands escorts her to the door and opens it
          
                              claudia
                    thank you i enjoyed our
                    conversation
          
                                eli
                    so did i
          
          eli closes the door then sits back at the table
          
          int palladium  carnegies bedroom  night
          
          carnegie washes looking at himself in the old dressingroom
          mirror he sees claudia enter the room in its dim reflection
          
                              carnegie
                    you took your time in there how
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water
          
          a subtly accusing tone it makes claudia nervous
          
                              claudia
                    he wanted to talk
          
                              carnegie
                    oh what about
          
                              claudia
                    nothing really he asked me what it
                    was like to be blind
          
                              carnegie
                    he tell you anything about him
          
                              claudia
                    no i dont think he likes to talk
                    about himself much
          
                              carnegie
                    yeah i got that
          
          claudia moves to the bedside begins to undress
          
                              claudia
                    i dont think hes going to change
                    his mind by morning i dont think
                    hes going to stay
          
                              carnegie
                    what makes you say that
          
                                                                44
          
          
                              claudia
                    just strikes me as the kind of man
                    whos of a mind is all doesnt
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once its set
          
                              carnegie
                    well well just see about that
          
                              claudia
                    you saw him hes not like the
                    others you wont be able to smooth
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do
          
                               carnegie
                    who said anything about me
                        beat
                    im sending solara
          
          claudia reacts suddenly to this shocked and angry
          
                              claudia
                    youre doing what
                              carnegie
                    you know how often these walkers
                    get laid never least not by
                    anything living or willing girl
                    like her can be very persuasive
          
                              claudia
                    you cant send her in there with
                    him hes dangerous hes a killer!
          
                              carnegie
                    you went in there readily enough
          
                              claudia
                    thats different solaras just a
                    child she cant
          
          carnegie sighs tiring of this
          
                              carnegie
                    shes a grown woman now claudia
                    sooner or later youre going to
                    have to accept that she has to
                    earn her keep around here same as
                    the rest of us
          
                              claudia
                    by working as a whore thats all
                    you think shes fit for
          
                                                                    45
          
          
                              carnegie
                    weve each been given a talent to
                    help us make our way in this world
                    some peoples gift is more evident
                    than others solaras sure as hell
                    is
          
          claudia looks at carnegie in disgust
          
                              claudia
                    what kind of a man are you
          
          now its carnegies turn to get angry he rounds on her
          menacingly she backs off as he approaches
          
                              carnegie
                    im the kind of man whod pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road a
                    girl whod been beaten and raped
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! without me youd
                    be just another noeye lying dead
                    in the outland picked clean by the
                    buzzards or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others thats the
                    kind of man i am!
          
          he has her against the wall his face just inches from hers
          
                              claudia
                    i dont live without fear i
                    havent for a long time now
          
          carnegie calms himself backs off claudia goes to leave
          
                              carnegie
                    where are you going
          
                              claudia
                    im not going to let you do this
          
          carnegie surges forward and pins claudia to the wall
          
                               carnegie
                    youre not going to let me
                        beat
                    nobody tells me what i can and
                    cant do in my own town nobody i
                    built this world and i am god
                    here! so dont go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans you know

                    me you get hurt you go against
                    me she gets hurt
          
                                                                 46
          
          
          he releases his grip on her
          
                              carnegie
                    so lets not see anybody get hurt
                    okay
          
          he speaks more softly now as he strokes his hand tenderly
          through claudias hair a tear runs down her cheek
          
          int palladium  guest bedroom  night
          
          dark outside but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp eli sits up on his bed quietly reading the old
          leatherbound book from his backpack
          
          another knock at the door eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt
          
                               eli
                    come in
          
          the door opens to reveal solara looking very different than
          she did before cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress blonde hair let down over her shoulders stunning
          
          unlike everyone else we have met she seems  physically at
          least  totally unscarred by the horrors of the times far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this
          
                              solara
                    hi can i come in

                    you sure about that
          
          she glides into the room closing the door shes good very
          seductive eli is totally disarmed in her presence
          
                              solara
                    its too bright in here mind if i
                    turn it down a little
          
          she doesnt wait for an answer moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp a darker more seductive lighting scheme
          
                              solara

          she looks up at eli imploringly transformed no longer the
          teenage sex kitten now shes just a frightened little girl
          
                              eli

                    where i was going i was just
                    moving from place to place trying
                    to stay alive and then one day i
                    heard this voice i dont know how
                    to explain it its like it was
                    coming from inside me but i could
                    hear it clear as day clear as i
                    can hear you talking to me now

                    really know where and i found this
                    book buried deep under some rubble
                    no way noone was ever going to
                    find it if they didnt know exactly

                    there lets eat
          
          she walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small
          cloth she whips it away  to reveal elis rat nibbling on a
          piece of cheese solara shrieks and backs away
          
          the rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto elis
          shoulder just as afraid of her as she is of it
          
                              eli

          solara approaches warily reaches out and strokes him the
          rat scurries up her arm she almost shrieks again
          
                              eli

          solara pets the rat on her shoulder then
          
                              solara

          beat eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
          thing when is the last time he had someone he could call a
          friend he cant even remember

          eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to solara shes
          about to eat but stops as eli clasp his hands in prayer

          unsure of what to do solara mimics eli putting her hands
          together and bowing her head

          they sit and eat together sharing the simple meal
          
          pull out from the window as they eat away from the theater
          away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight
          moving farther and farther away until the entire town is
          consumed by the darkness of the world
          
          ext desert town  main street  dawn
          
          the pale sun rises over the town to establish
          
                                                                    56

          what was once the theaters costume room  old mannequins
          still stand around in the corners creating an eerie feel
          
          carnegie and claudia sit at a dining table eating breakfast
          in silence a third place is set but noone is seated there
          
          solara enters and sits down without a word
          
                              carnegie
                    good morning solara

          claudia appears perturbed by carnegies subtle probing
          solara flashes him a frosty look
          
                              solara

          carnegie glares at her sternly
          
                              carnegie
                    you dont speak to your father like

                    question i expect a civil answer
          
          solara lowers her head scorned carnegie continues eating
          
                              carnegie

                    change his mind about staying

                    i dont know he said he had to go

          carnegie puts down his food looks angrily at her

                    so he did talk what else did he
                    say come on i want all of it!

                    going to be leaving this morning

                    solara honey eat something
          
          she looks at the food on the plate before her then closes
          her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer
          
                              solara

                    he had them written down in a book
          
          this piques carnegies interest greatly
          
                              carnegie

                    show me
          
          solara makes the sign of a crucifix with her index fingers
          carnegies eyes widen he can barely believe it
          
                              carnegie
                    he had a bible

          carnegie bolts suddenly from the table overturning his chair
          and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor
          
          int palladium  lobby balcony  continuous
          
          carnegie races across the landing toward the armed guard
          posted outside elis bedroom the guard steps aside as

          angrily at her shaking her

                    would find the place where it was
                    needed where it would be safe

          he doesnt turn or acknowledge her at all just keeps walking
          off into the horizon getting smaller all the time
          
          solara stands there in the road weeping all alone
          
                              solara
                        softly

          a small pennedin area to the rear of the palladium
          containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals goats
          sheep geese pigs mostly mangy sadlooking specimens
          
          carnegie stands in the yard tossing handfuls of animal feed
          from a nearby sack onto the ground he watches with
          satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed
          
          claudia emerges from the theater with an icepack
          
                              carnegie

          carnegie applies it to his jaw red and swollen from elis
          pistolwhip redridge appears nearby his arm in a sling
          
                              redridge
                    he killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch they
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didnt get hit once i never
                    even heard of anything like that
          
          carnegie doesnt appear to be listening he is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals
          
                              carnegie
                    you know i always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost
                    tending to my flock but all the
                    things i want to do i cant do
                    them on my own the one thing ive

                    it was done with the power of
                    words i created this place out of
                    nothing because people believed in
                    a promise that i sold to them

                    richer than you could ever dream

          she comes to a fork in the road stops at the junction
          unsure was this here before she doesnt remember

          firmly on the horizon takes a swig from his canteen
          
          suddenly he stops and stands stock still in the center of
          the road impossible to know what hes thinking
          
          he stands there for a long time

          theres a rusted car parked at one of the pumps like every
          other car weve seen stripped of its tires and engine
          
          she walks around to the drivers side a petrified female
          body lies on the ground halfin halfout of the car
          
          solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils horrified
          
          in the dead womans hand is a dusty bottle of mineral water
          solara hesitates not wanting to get closer but so thirsty
          
          she braces herself grimacing and tries to take the bottle
          but the dead womans hand is closed tight around it she
          pulls harder and wrenches it free in the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back
          
                                                                  71
          
          
          in the other womans arm she has a skeletal baby cradled to
          her bosom it seems to be staring right at solara
          
          solara screams and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt
          
          she stops by the station shop and rests against the wall
          hyperventilating heart pounding trying to get it together
          
          she inspects the water in the bottle it looks clean
          unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip
          
          she spits it back out coughing its rank undrinkable

          she moves further in searching for something anything but
          the place has been gutted theres nothing she checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators shattered glass all empty
          
          shes never known desolation and emptiness like this its
          beginning to scare her she wheels around in a panic

          a female figure is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead hard to see what shes doing from here

          muttering to herself gathering objects up from the road
          
          as solara moves closer we see that the woman is struggling
          with an upturned shopping cart stuck in a roadside ditch
          its contents spilled out next to a few bracken bushes
          
                                                                   72

          the woman seems anxious to get rid of her tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes but solara doesnt get it
          
                                solara
                      itll just take a minute
          
          she steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out
          
                                young woman
                      really its fine! please!
          
          too   late three road brigands pounce from the bushes every
          bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that eli killed on
          the   road in our opening they grab solara and drag her from
          the   road into the desert screaming and kicking all the way
          
                                young woman
                      let her go! she aint got nothing!
          
          the brigand leader looks solara up and down lustfully
          
                                brigand leader
                      i aint too sure about that
          
          solara is reviled by the man hes filthy his stench
          overpowering one eye missing just a dark empty socket he
          licks his lips revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth
          
                                young woman
                      this wasnt the deal!
          
          the brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat
          
                                                                    73
          
          
                              brigand leader
                    shut your mouth bitch you oughta
                    be grateful youre getting a break
          
          he releases her she slumps to the dirt whimpering
          
                              brigand leader
                    never did care much for that dried
                    up old snatch anyhow
          
          he looks back to the struggling solara
          
                              brigand leader
                    this one though this one looks
                    fresh you a virgin
          
          she says nothing just sobs helplessly
          
                              brigand leader
                    well lets find out
          
          he unbuckles his pants lets them drop to his ankles
          
          we hear a sound its hard to place something like a thhup
          
          the brigand leader is frozen in shock his face goes pale
          the blood draining from it the two bandits holding solara
          look at their leader in dismay staring down at his crotch
          
          a quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down
          
          there is an arrow imbedded in his crotch what was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat more blood
          streams down his thighs a real horror show
          
          he staggers backward shrieking hands shaking staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends
          
          the two other brigands release solara and whip around
          scanning the horizon they see nothing one of them has a
          rifle he unslings it and aims it frantically around
          
          then they both see it coming right at them the most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen
          
          eli walking toward them from the road out of the sun his
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat an avenging angel
          
          he pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him finger tightening on the trigger
          
          eli shoots the arrow sails through the air and right into
          the rifle barrel the feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight
          
                                                                  74
          
          
          rifle bandit pulls the trigger the gun explodes blowing his
          hands clean off he falls to the ground screaming
          
          eli only had two arrows he shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword all the remaining brigand has is a small knife the
          two now square off at arms length a hopeless mismatch
          
          beat the knife brigand hesitates trembling and then rushes
          eli with the knife eli deftly sidesteps flourishes the
          sword so quick it almost seems like he didnt move at all
          
          the knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps his
          hand goes limp and drops the knife
          
          and then his head falls backward like a pez dispenser almost
          completely decapitated but not quite blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt
          
          eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground but still breathing he stands over their
          fallen bodies they stare back up at him helpless
          
          he crouches down between them in the dust
          
                              eli
                    i offer you both one final chance
                    in this life to seek forgiveness
                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation will you say
                    with me the act of contrition
          
          the brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him
          
                                brigand leader
                    fuck you
          
          eli sighs stands and looks down on him without pity
          
                              eli

                    whats coming to you
          
          he plunges his sword into the bandit leader finishing him
          off pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean
          
          he turns to the other man raising his sword
          
                                rifle bandit
                    wait!

                    heartily sorry for having offended
                    thee and i detest all my sins
          
          the bandit follows along with eli mouthing the words
          quietly the life ebbing from him with each moment
          
                              eli

          his eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him dead eli
          signs a cross over his body then stands and walks away
          
          solara sits on the ground nearby a wreck eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms she clings on to him tightly
          
                              solara

          she looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt
          
                              solara
                    what about her

          metal garage doors roll back to reveal darkness within
          
          a pair of headlights fires up full beam right at us
          
          a vehicle roars out of the darkness onto the street heavily
          modified with plate armor and turretmounted weapons but its
          original form still recognizable underneath
          
          its a honda odyssey minivan once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms transformed now into an armored personnel carrier
          
          another minivan roars from the garage behind it a dodge
          grand caravan similarly customized and armed to the teeth
          
          three more cars follow as eclectic an assortment as you
          could imagine a mini cooper ford explorer a prius each
          adorned with plate armor and weapons
          
          in the lead minivan is redridge heavily armed he nods to
          the driver who guns the engine
          
          the fleet of armored vehicles moves out kicking up a great
          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town

          late afternoon the sun hangs low on the horizon were far
          from the road nothing but scrub brush and a few prairie dog
          burrows dotted around
          
          a prairie dog pops its head up scans the horizon sniffing
          the air whiskers twitching and is skewered by an arrow
          
          thirty yards away one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to come alive and then we realize it is elis ghillie suit
          camouflaging both he and solara beneath it
          
          eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog solara just stands there appalled
          
                              solara
                    you killed it! that cute little
                    thing!

          he yanks out the bloody arrow solara looks away
          
          when she turns back eli is standing right there holding the
          dead animal in front of her face she yelps in surprise and
          staggers backward falling on her butt
          
                              solara

          into it teasing solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes he feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder

                    christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago he wanted to be a
                    good man he wanted to help people
                    so he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across he was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldnt carry
          
          solara listens rapt eli is a good storyteller
          
                              eli
                    then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy he was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried
                    the boy explained that he was the
                    son of god and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world after that
                    christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river and thats how he became
                    a saint later on he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers

                    doing good things for others
                    enough that god himself took a
                    special interest in them
          
          solara looks at eli tenderly with admiration

          pack halfhidden in the looming shadows of the cave his hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword
          
          solara sleeps nearby then opens her eyes not asleep after
          all she looks over at eli  his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if hes asleep or awake
          
                              solara
                    eli
          
          no response quietly she moves forward kneeling by his
          side she opens his coat and checks the pockets empty
          
          she goes deeper peeling back the layers of clothing
          stealthily frisking him she finds something on his lapel
          hidden under several layers that causes her to stop
          
          its a rectangular plastic badge the red white and blue
          colors faded and worn it reads

          she stares at it for a moment not knowing what to make of
          it then moves on continuing to pat him down
          
          whatever shes looking for is not here she turns her
          attention to the backpack slowly carefully opens it up
          
          there it is the bible wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine she reaches in for it
          
          suddenly elis hand shoots out and grabs her by the wrist
          she cries out startled eli sits up his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows for the first time he appears a little
          scary to solara

          she lies back down beside him but doesnt close her eyes
          she just lies there watching him
          
          ext wasteland  dawn
          
          the sun rises out of the east and out of the sun comes the
          fleet of armored vehicles racing sidebyside down the road
          
          the lead vehicle comes to a halt a door opens and redridge
          gets out more armed men emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside
          
          the dead brigands are splayed out in the dirt where eli slew
          them a flock of buzzards is picking their bones clean

                    hes been here
          
          redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
          bodies and back onto the road two sets of tracks
          
                              redridge
                    the girls with him

                    move out!
          
          the other men hold for a moment still looking at the half
          eaten bodies in the dirt redridge turns back
          
                              redridge
                    i said move out!

          solara looks up at the sweltering sun then around at her
          surroundings nothing but devastation and decay

                    god has a reason for everything
                    being the way it is its not
                    always apparent to us but it is
                    his plan nonetheless
          
                              solara
                    so is he talking to you right now

                    i dont know what that word means
          
          beat as eli thinks on how to explain it
          
                              eli
                    it means you know something even
                    though you dont know it
          
          solara thinks about this shakes her head
          
                              solara
                    that doesnt make any sense at all
          
                              eli

          on the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble
          
          except for one small house the building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition it stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact
          
          the windows are barred the outer structure fortified with
          sheet metal and other custom patchups the whole plot
          surrounded by a chainlink fence topped with razor wire
          
          eli and solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby
          
                              solara
                    i dont get it it looks almost
                    normal like nothing ever happened
                    how can it still be out here

                              solara
                    maybe we should look inside there
                    might be food
          
          beat as eli considers then stands and unhooks his shotgun
          
                              eli
                    stay behind me
          
          they approach the house cautiously arrive at the perimeter
          fence theres a gate held in place by a padlock
          
          eli pulls a pair of boltcutters from his belt and snips the
          padlock free swings open the gate with a metallic squeak
          
          they move inside up the garden path though the soil in the
          yard is dead its been carefully raked and tended weeds
          arranged in thoughtful patterns like real flowers
          
                              solara
                    this is weird
          
                              eli
                    yeah
          
          eli steps forward his foot planting on a cracked paving
          stone that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet
          accompanied by a barely audible sound he looks down
          
                              eli
                    shit

                    what
          
          a rope noose suddenly whips around their feet tightening at
          their ankles and yanking them upsidedown into the air eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground
          
          they hang there for a moment twisting in the breeze
          
          the front door to the house swings open to reveal
          
          an elderly couple the womans gray hair tied into a neat
          bun the man bald squinting through wireframe glasses they
          look like the couple from grant woods american gothic
          
          instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12gauge riot shotgun
          which he keeps trained from the hip on eli and solara
          
                                                                 85
          
          
          they step outside regarding their new visitors carefully
          the man seems more suspicious than his wife he drags elis
          shotgun toward him with his foot hands it to his wife
          
                              elderly man
                    who are you

          the wife steps forward shes much warmer less guarded
          
                              elderly woman

          the woman glares at him the husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus releases the rope
          dropping eli and solara to the ground in a heap
          
          the old woman helps them to their feet they shake off the
          noose from their ankles
          
                                elderly woman

                    george would you care for some
                    tea
          
          eli and solara exchange a look what the hell is this
          
          int house  living room  day
          
          its like something out of the world before the interior is
          almost perfectly preserved chintzy couches a mahogany
          table a tv set in the corner lace curtains unreal
          
          eli and solara sit on the couch feeling selfconscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment
          
          george sits across from them on the couch scowling at them
          inhospitably the shotgun resting across his lap
          
          martha emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups cracked and faded but intact
          she places the tray on the coffee table and sits
          
                              martha
                    im afraid we dont have any cake
                    or biscuits for the tea they ran
                    out some time ago
          
          she lifts the tea port and pours into the cups but its not
          tea only water somewhat murky water eli and solara stare
          at the cups unsure martha gestures toward them
          
                              martha
                    please
          
          they raise their cups and take a sip martha watches eagerly
          its clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving tea to guests
          
                                                                 87

          martha smiles delighted she lifts her own cup to her lips
          her hands tremble the cup rattling against the saucer
          
                              eli

                    well george is something of a
                    handyman arent you dear he did
                    a lot of work on the place making

          he stands and moves toward the back door opens it up and
          beckons eli and solara to come look
          
          ext house  back yard  continuous
          
          eli and solara stand in the doorway looking out on the yard
          solara is horrified by what she sees
          
                                                                 88
          
          
          the entire back yard is a graveyard maybe twenty human
          graves dug shallow into the earth some were dug long ago
          others look like theyre very recent
          
                              solara
                    are these graves
          
                              martha
                    of course it would be uncivilized
                    not to bury them were not
                    barbarians

          george and martha go back inside leaving eli and solara
          gazing at the little graveyard
          
                              eli

                    so soon
          
          an unnerving glint in his eye eli moves toward the door

                    yes im afraid so
          
          as he gets to the door george moves to intercept hard to
          tell if hes blocking his path or moving to open the door for
          him a tense beat
          
          martha emerges from the kitchen

          eli and solara emerge into the sunlight walk down the garden
          path and freeze in their tracks
          
          the armed vehicles are coming driving toward them out of the
          horizon in a hazy cloud of dust

          martha rushes to the window pulls aside the lace curtain
          outside she sees the armored vehicles screeching to a halt
          
          the men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
          them locking and loading weapons
          
                              martha

          she goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions
          underneath is a wooden lid which she throws open to reveal
          
          a huge cache of weapons automatic rifles shotguns pistols
          grenades and enough ammunition for everything

          redridge raises his hand to silence him looks up as an
          upstairs window slides open
          
          a cloth package is tossed from the window it lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from redridge
          
          cautiously he approaches the package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine it looks like elis bible
          
          he picks it up and tugs at the twine untying it folds away
          the cloth wrapping looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object at the words written on the front of it
          
                                this side to face enemy
          
          its a miniature claymore mine the small red light on top of
          the unit illuminates with a beep armed

          he drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back
          toward the vehicles
          
                                redridge
                      get down! everybody get down!
          
          he dives across the trunk of the explorer into cover as the
          mine explodes shattering every window of every vehicle the
          lightweight mini cooper takes the main brunt and explodes
          cartwheeling through the air a burning wreck
          
          redridge looks around three men lie dead already flaming
          wreckage all around him suddenly its a war zone
          
          machinegun fire erupts from the house peppering the
          vehicles armor the gunmen cower behind cover

          redridge aims at the house and opens fire inspired by his
          example the others follow a hail of bullets crisscross
          back and forth the houses faded paint facade is shredded

          george and eli also open fire from their windows
          periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire
          
          solara sits across the room in the corner sobbing

          she nods
          
          eli peeks out and fires out the window dropping one of the
          enemy gunmen with a crack shot ducks back down as the return
          fire impacts around him
          
                                                                 94

          now six more still standing no lessening of fire from
          inside the house theyre losing
          
          redridge races between the vehicles ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the dodge caravan pops the
          trunk and pulls out a rocketpropelled grenade launcher
          
          he sets it on his shoulder rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim and fires the rocket screams toward its target tearing
          through the chain fence and tearing an entire corner from the
          house in a fiery explosion
          
          int house  continuous
          
          filled with smoke the sounds of coughing
          
          dazed george pushes his way through the smoke waving his
          arms to clear it a bloody gash on his forehead
          
                              george
                    martha martha!
          
          he finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
          kitchen or at least her top half the rest of her is gone
          
          george slumps to his knees with tearfilled eyes takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment
          
                                                                    95
          
          
          then the anger returns he gets up and turns consumed now by
          a wild fury firing with rage over the torn brick wall he
          clips another gunman in the head killing him
          
          george moves back toward the living room firing as he goes

          butt of his rifle then shifts the transmission into drive

                    take your shit and get out of here
          
          eli gathers up his stuff into his pack shoulders it and goes
          to pick up his sword but redridge puts his boot on it
          
                              redridge
                    no weapons
          
          eli still has a halfdozen guns trained on him he turns and
          walks away toward the road as he passes solara
          
                                                                   99

                    you have faith
          
          a tear runs down solaras cheek as she watches him walk away
          
          redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
          vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out
          
          in the rearmost vehicle
          
          solara sits in the back seat staring out the rear window as
          it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy
          
          she watches as eli moves away down the road getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon
          
          she bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears
          
          later
          
          solara in the back seat calmer now the tears dried on her
          cheeks she sits staring blankly at the driver in front
          
          and then she lunges violently forward clawing and biting at
          the driver who struggles to fight her off his hands come
          off the wheel and the car fishtails wildly
          
          redridges vehicle
          
          the driver sees something odd in the rearview mirror
          
                              driver
                    what the hell
          
          redridge turns to see the car behind veering erratically then
          slamming on the brakes stopping in the middle of the road
          
                              redridge
                    stop stop!
          
          the car screeches to a halt redridge watches through the
          rear window as the drivers side door opens and the driver is
          kicked out onto the asphalt
          
          the door closes again the engine revs and the car turns
          around racing back down the road in the direction it came
          
                              redridge
                    shit turn around!

                    drive on
          
          the car moves on following the rest of the convoy
          
          ext house  day
          
          solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
          wreckage of the besieged house she runs from the vehicle to
          where elis sword lies in the dirt and grabs it up
          
          ext road  dusk
          
          solara races down the road in the car pedal to the metal
          
                              solara
                    come on come on
          
          eventually she sees him at first just a dot on the horizon
          but unmistakably eli by now shed know him anywhere
          
          suddenly the engine splutters she checks the fuel gauge the
          needle deep in the red she pounds the wheel in frustration
          
                                solara
                    no no!
          
          the car grinds to a halt dead she flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle rushing after eli on foot
          
          on eli as always his pace steady and slow the sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon headed always west
          
          solara is running up behind him a hundred yards back
          
                                solara
                    eli! eli!
          
          he doesnt stop or look back just keeps on walking
          
          she finally catches up with him breathing hard exhausted
          
                                                                  101

          she continues walking alongside him trying to process this
          this kind of compassion is totally foreign to her
          
          she holds out the sword offering it to eli by way of
          atonement

          follow it uphill finally reaching its crest where they stop

          on the other side of the bay san francisco  or the little
          that remains of it the city has been almost totally
          destroyed  entire areas reduced to rubble the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse

          they pass by the wreckage of a hotel nothing but the lobby
          still standing a hilton sign protruding from the rubble

          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot he steps carefully

          eli and solara walk along the pier until they reach its end
          the original end has long since collapsed into the sea but a

          alcatraz island
          
          looking much the same as it always has old and dilapidated
          the coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look it
          feels almost like a mythic place  the promised land eli
          has sought for so many years
          
          a tattered stars and stripes still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse

          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles

          keeping the gun trained on them the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a walkietalkie radio we dont hear
          the conversation all eli and solara can do is wait

          mechanical runners with the low groan of rusted iron
          
          eli and solara look at each other then step gingerly inside
          
                                                                106

          floor to ceiling with books lombardi shows eli and solara
          around behind them a pair of armed guards follow closely

                    hope to have operational soon
          
          solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books
          shes never seen anything like it
          
                              solara

                    the earth was without form and

                    of the deep and the spirit of god
                    was hovering over the face of the

          carnegie sits at his desk still in shock elis bible sits
          open on the desk before him
          
          a braille bible
          
          claudia is ushered in by a guard
          
                              claudia
                    whats wrong
          
          he rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands
          
                              carnegie
                    you told me once that you know how
                    to read this this blind language
          
                              claudia
                    well a long time ago when i was a
                    little girl
          
                              carnegie
                    youre going to read it for me

                    it down start at the beginning
          
          as carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen claudia
          opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
          lettering
          
                                                                111
          
          
          for a moment there is a glimmer of recognition a faint
          smile but then it fades as carnegie turns back to her
          eagerly clutching the writing materials
          
                               claudia
                    im sorry its been so long i
                    dont remember i dont remember
                    any of it
          
          carnegie is aghast beat as the anger swells within him
          threatening to explode
          
                              carnegie
                    god fucking dammit!
          
          he swipes violently at the bible knocking it out of
          claudias hands he grabs it up and tries to rip it in two
          but its too thick to tear redfaced with rage he tosses it
          out over the box balcony it lands somewhere in the dark
          auditorium below between the rows of gutted theater seats
          
          as he paces angrily back past claudia
          
                              claudia
                    bill is there something
          
                              carnegie
                    just go just get out of my sight
          
          he slumps in his chair exhausted and furious claudia sadly
          turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts
          
          int alcatraz  cafeteria  night
          
          some considerable time later great stacks of paper have been
          filled with lombardis handwriting
          
          lombardis pen races across the paper struggling to keep up
          with elis recitation
          
          solara is curled up on a nearby bench asleep elis coat
          covering her to keep her warm
          
          eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite
          he looks paler now than ever close to death

          ext alcatraz  exercise yard  predawn
          
          the prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn
          
          solara crosses the yard she looks more mature somehow
          determined and strong she carries with her elis sword  and
          something else tucked under her arm

                    for your many signs along the way
          
          she stops in a nondescript corner of the yard
          
          at her feet is a shallow mound of dirt at the head of the
          mound a simple tombstone
          
          she kneels and places a single flower on the grave
          
          int palladium  carnegies bedroom  night
          
          lit only by the pale moonlight barely enough to see by
          
          carnegie sleeps soundly in bed next to him lies claudia
          wide awake she checks that carnegie is sound asleep careful
          not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits
          
          int palladium auditorium  night
          
          claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness searching
          blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats
          
          she finds elis bible in some litter strewn on the floor
          
                              eli vo
                    thank you for the good that i have
                    done for whatever light you were
                    able to shine into the darkness of
                    this world through me
          
          sitting in the darkness claudia opens the book and runs her
          fingers across the braille reading and though we can barely
          see in the dim light we see the smile on her face the joy
          
          ext alcatraz  exercise yard  dawn
          
          as solara kneels by the grave we see now that she wears
          elis saint christopher pendant around her neck
          
          the tombstone reads
          
                                                                113

                            faithful servant to the lord
                                and friend to solara
          
          she unsheathes elis sword plants it in the ground before
          his grave takes the book from under her arm and opens it up
          
          its a new bible crudely typeset from lombardis original
          transcription and printed on the prison press
          
          she opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over elis grave we dont hear what she says
          
          as solara finishes her reading and closes the bible lombardi
          appears behind her
          
                              lombardi
                    you know you dont have to leave

                    thanks
          
          she stands pulling elis sword from the earth
          
                              solara
                    but i gotta do what i gotta do

                    where will you go
          
          beat solara looks at the sword her fingers playing across
          its hilt the blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun
          
          there is a determined purposeful look in her eye
          
                               solara
                    home
          
          ext alcatraz island  dawn
          
          the sun rises through the fog on the horizon
          
          the great iron gates grind open solara emerges from inside
          the prison steps out onto the island rock
          
          she is dressed in a flak jacket combat pants and boots
          elis old pack across her back hair tied in a neat pony
          tail atop that elis ragged fur hat
          
                              eli vo
                    thank you for the friend i made

          in her hand she clutches a copy of the newlyprinted bible
          elis sword slung over her shoulder
          
                              eli vo
                    please watch over her as you
                    watched over me
          
          montage as solara walks back along fishermans wharf
          through the san francisco rubble across the golden gate
          bridge
          
                              eli vo
                    thank you for allowing me finally
                    to rest im so very tired the
                    time of my departure is at hand and
                    now i surrender my soul into your
                    care at peace in knowing that i
                    have carried out your will that i
                    have done right with my time on
                    this earth
          
          ext road  day
          
          and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the
          desert wasteland she looks up and down the road then turns
          and heads toward the sun on the horizon headed east
          
                              eli vo
                    i have fought the good fight i
                    have finished the race
          
          as she walks away into the sun her lonely silhouette on the
          road reminds us of eli as we saw him so many times before
          
                              eli vo
                    i have kept the faith
          
          she grows smaller and smaller as she walks into the distance
          until she consumed by the rising sun and we
          
                                                          fade out
