          misses a step or two but who the hell cares
          on the floor sean gapes eyes popping tess is pokerfaced

          as the song climaxes ali finishes with an alluring toss of
          her ass then lands in a sexy layout on a chair owning the
          stage the music ends a stunned silence the only sound
          is alis heavy breathing
          then georgia jumps up applauding effusively

          int burlesque lounge  night  carry music

          a spotlight moving down the smokefilled shaft of light as
          a figure rises into view at the back of the stage over the
          contemporary beat we hear a beautiful classic opera
          carmen revealits nikki! she sings a line or two in an
          amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away then a
          dance beat kicks in as coco comes into view and sings

          sounds of people talking glasses clinking all the
          background sounds of a busy nightclub a loud drum roll takes
          us to
          a low camera moving across a black stage as we move in on the
          footlights which become a million brilliant lights blasting
          into camera blinding us until they form letters reading

                                     burlesque
