	fade in

	roll credits over

	ext golf course  dawn

	various extra closeups of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens

	a polished brass sprinkler head

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew
	soaked lawn

	fleet of ducklings

	no mother in sight cruise through the thrushes

	graveyard of golf balls underwater

	at the bottom of a water hazard

	palm fronds

	after a neat they sway revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis the sun already bakes the 
	air we hear the opening guitar strains of the kim dealkurt 
	cobain suet of what i did for love as we crane down the 
	palms to

	a brandnew titleist 3 ball

	just on the edge of the rough a pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in an iron confidently addresses the ball and chips 
	it out the trousers walk out after it

	hands

	digging dirt out of the grooves of the irons face with a 
	golf tee while on the way to the green both hands are 
	gloved instead of one and the gloves are black

	yellow trousers

	in a squat over the ball sizing up the curvy fiftyfoot 
	journey to the hole the figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball then pops the ball lightly the ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole

	the gloved hand

	sets the ball on the next tee the figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag the hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground reach into the bag drawing 
	out a compact sniper rifle affixed with a long silencer 
	the figure drops one knee down onto the rag the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes we move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper concentrating down the scope in his half
	squat he is martin blank

	we swing around behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him fourhundred yards away on another part of the course 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough three miniscule silverhaired figures come into view 
	one of them in a red sweater sets up for first putt he 
	could be an investment banker or an arms trader

	martins arm

	flinches and a low thunk reports from the rifle a second 
	later in the distance the

	red sweaters head

	seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist his 
	body crumples to the green

	martin

	returns the rifle to the bag pulls out a driver moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball he watches its path and whispers 
	absently

	int club house patio  later

	the outdoor postgolf luncheon area of an elite texas golf 
	club martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types club member #1 has a buddhalike 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk

				  club member #1
		id come to the realization that 
		everything id based my life on was 
		false and that my life had no 
		meaning

				  club member #2
			to martin
		he gets this way when he hits over 
		eightyfive

				  club member #1
		it seemed like my life was slipping 
		away somehow i was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope everything was 
		futile and nothing had value

				  club member #3
		thats the way life is the only 
		meaning and value is what we create 
		through structure and discipline 
		though they seem to limit our freedom 
		they actually give us great comfort 
		your problem is youre looking for 
		some great answer some ultimate 
		truth when what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home

				  club member #2
		and take golf lessons

				  club member #1
		thats a tragedy can i finish my 
		story please i began my search for 
		meaning i was a catholic jew 
		scientologist sufi buddhist i 
		went to a psychologist psychiatrist 
		herbalist nutritionist a shaman 
		and a psychic and they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff

				  club member #2
		a jew a shaman and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing youre 
		insane

				  club member #1
		basically the same thing in a very 
		evolved esoteric way

				  club member #2
		insane

				  club member #1
		to make a long story short

				  club member #3
		thank god

				  club member #1
		at last i found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth 
		and everyday i see the world through

		creation and wonder

				  club member #2

	hands it over to martin in the distance sirens begin to 
	wail

				  club member #1

		everyday shape of a pan pizza each

	toward his rented town car as the valet pulls it up he meets 
	the valet by the trunk where he trades tip for keys

				  martin at car
		he fishes out the laminated personal 
		pan power card looks at it and 
		tosses it onto the ground police 
		cars now visible in the distance 
		wind into the long club driveway 
		martin gets into his car and pulls 
		away

	laminated card

	as it lays on the asphalt the wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it

	int airliner  day

	martin sits in a first class seat the tray table flipped 
	down on the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds  sports illustrated mademoiselle wired 
	rolling stone national review spin national geographic 
	and on he draws one off the top and flips through it 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing when he is 
	done with one he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another martins way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him

	int hired car new york  day

	the livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at kennedy airport 
	martin reclines in the back seat a conversation having 
	already begun

				  driver

		thats it then thats it ive always 
		been alone thats why im a good 
		driver i can handle it see i can 
		think on my feet i survive im a 
		thinker and i can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		dont bother me some people cant 
		do it! some people are ranting and 
		raving tell them fuckin people to

				  martin
		you understand the psychology of the 
		job

				  driver
		i do some guys cant adjust to it 
		they cant handle it

	int car  manhattan streets  later

	the car cuts through the upper east side martin and the 
	driver exchange looks through the rearview mirror

				  driver

		away and thinking about other things 
		im right about that arent i

				  martin
		no

				  driver

		im right sometimes you are

				  martin

		natural

				  driver
			laughs to himself at 
			this great truth
		its only natural

	the driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  driver
		i been looking at you and ive 
		decided that i want to share something 
		with you

				  martin
		okay

				  driver
		because your problem is youre bored 
		and you have a very big mind
			beat
		i am part of what i call a brain 
		syndicate

	no reaction from martin

				  driver
		i am part of a network of minds a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected over hundreds even 
		thousands of miles through the mind 
		we can think with each other think 
		for each other i can be driving 
		somewhere sleeping with a woman 
		whatever it is and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		elses mind far away running someone 
		elses brain

				  martin
			indicates

				  driver
		and when you think of it its not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world is 
		it

	int hotel room new york city  day

	a sedate and wellappointed fourstar suite on the upper 
	east side martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant highrise across 
	the street he lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back a cellular phone rings interrupting him he moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase

	he glances over to a second window to his left which offers 
	a view further down the street he goes to it he raises the 
	scope and sees

	martins pov/scope window #2

	a few blocks down small even through the highpowered scope 
	is your average bicycle messenger dressed in lycra racing 
	gear weaving through traffic toward us slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag the messengers hand is 
	hidden in it the other phone begins to ring

				  martin

	of a doorman opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits four bodyguards form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man a mall avuncular figure in his forties dressed in

	takes a step back into the shadows of the room and raises 
	the rifle toward window #2

	martins pov/scope  window #2

	of an empty street the bicycle messenger flashes past

	martin

	concentrating tracks the path of the messenger leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between window #2 and window #1

	street

	the bicycle messenger bears down on the group of men drawing 
	a mac10 submachine gun from his bag the group see him 
	just as martins sniper fire explodes the messengers chest 
	two of the bodyguards collapse onto their boss the other 
	two open fire on the messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them

	martin

	withdraws from the window and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle

				  martin
		sorry tom but look i know its the 
		playoffs thats why im offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat

	martin listens patiently as he works

	ext street  same  intercut

	just finishes packing

				  martin
		well let me ask you tom what do

	the two bodyguards kick at the messengers body the other 
	two begin to move off of their boss who rises cowering the 
	doorman stands behind it all unbuttoning his coat

	doorman

	a tall dark sharpfeatured man in his forties wearing a 
	handlebar moustache he moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome 44 magnum 
	charthouse bulldog revolvers and opens fire on them

	martin

	is closing his bag when he hears the gunthunder

				  martin
		never mind i gotta go

	window

	martins pov/scope

	of the doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards 
	he gets to the man at the bottom their boss the doorman 
	fires both guns

	martin

	reacts surprised to see a second shooter he pulls himself 
	from the window puts away his scope and accelerates his 
	exit

	highrise foyer

	outside we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies he walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit 
	he sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag

	martin

	his two parcels in hand exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street

	doorman

	now wearing rich mans sweats hops off the loading dock 
	walks to a lincoln town car and drives off

	martin hangs up and pulls away

	int airliner  day

	martin sits in first class wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel he folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines 
	he looks up as he hears pilot vo  its seventysix degrees 
	and partly cloudy in chicago this afternoon

	int apartment chicago  night

	martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment he wearily 
	drops his carryon bag and briefcase in the hall

	int living room  later

	martin sits on a futon couch watching mtv with no sound on 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddishorange beverage

	int living room  later

	martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor his eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest

				  woman vo
		dear alumni can you believe its 
		been ten years where are you now

	after a moment his eyes open alerted his head turns to 
	the side and his hands lightly cup the headphones

	closeup wire

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light definitely not a 
	walkman the wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box across the floor connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor

				  woman vo
		are you guiding an outward bound 
		canoe trip like brook stinson or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the nfl like leslie gunther

	martin  a minute later

	draws a precut section of the floor the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long by a string

	video monitor  a minute later

	the greenish starlight night vision image of a young husky 
	man sleeping on his back as seen from above a fine thread 
	snakes from behind camera to just above the mans slack mouth 
	we pull back to reveal a sony watchman that holds the image 
	keep pulling to reveal martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiberoptic cable through the hole 
	in the floor

	martin  a minute later

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread as the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor his attention shifts to the

	video monitor

	the drops huge in the foreground become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man

				  woman vo
		could it be that youre like chip 
		longfellow at the traderelations 
		tank in washington sandy glasser 
		owns a cheese shop!

	martin

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand and lowers the 
	fiberoptic cable with the other

	video monitor

	the face begins to fill the screen as the fiberoptic follows 
	the drops toward it suddenly the man snorts and turns his 
	face

	a drop falls

	it misses the mans mouth and hits his cheek

	video monitor

	the mans eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	camera his image falls away as the fiberoptic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor

				  woman vo
		looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories!

				  martin vo
			hushed
		fuck!

	martin

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag and flies out 
	of frame

				  woman vo
		some good some bad but all 
		interesting

	int hallway  moments later

	a bodyguard sits outside an apartment door a muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet gun 
	in hand an exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	martin his gun already pointed at the bodyguard the 
	bodyguard levels his at martin

				  martin
		freeze! police!

	the bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get doubletapped 
	through the head

				  woman vo
		as a graduate of the class of 
		1984 you are someone special

	martin moves to the dead bodyguard and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt he unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door he lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment

	int husky mans apartment  seconds later

	martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch he comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold

				  woman vo
		whenever news of you filters back 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments

	int hallway  continuous

	martin crouches down outside the bedroom door he points the 
	gun at the door and reaching up turns the knob as the door 
	opens the husky man fires wildly over martins head martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor

				  woman vo
		we hope grosse pointe high prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world

	martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man and raises 
	his barrel to the mans forehead

				  woman vo

		can go that you havent learned how 
		to go in time its easy

				  husky man

		that men have who belong to western 
		culture its centuries old like 
		king phillip in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought well 
		wouldnt it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought oh the 
		saracens  so he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families

	martin dennis and mike are two suits in the midst of a non
	stop sports conversation

				  mike

		responsible though dennis because 
		theyre the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product

				  dennis

		look at it mike that park is a 
		beautiful park ive gone to that 
		park many times  ive had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and lets face it i tell 
		you this mike by the sixth inning

		relations its a very specialized 
		company we execute economic 
		investment opportunities sort of 
		economic cleanup with an emphasis 
		on personnel its boring you know 
		its boring i dont like to talk 
		about it because i dont think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is

	martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table 
	martin may be in trouble

				  martin
		ive always tried to refrain from 
		a blackandwhite moral lexiconyou 
		know good bad right wrongive 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas

	silence martin pushes on

				  martin
		but thats no way to live i guess 
		youve got to just take the leap of 
		faith believe in something fuck 
		it

				  darius
		sounds complicated martin are you 
		happy

				  martin
		i just have to close this one last 
		account id like to just stop now 
		today but i cant its a step in 
		the right direction

				  debi
		i dont know martin it sounds like 
		youre feeling compromised live the 
		way you want the only thing thats 
		inexcusable to me is cynicism 
		thats the biggest copout there is

	nods of assent come from around the table a brief silence 
	and then

				  amy

	across the table from martin and debi dennis turns to darius

				  dennis
		what do you think about black coaching 
		in the nfl darius because i think 
		its great

				  darius
		i dont pay much attention to 
		football

				  mike
		i have to agree with you dennis 
		its good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or qb when for 
		years in the league theyve been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game

				  dennis
		but now you see you have warren 
		moon at the helm cunningham art 
		shell and the coach up at 
		minnesota

				  mike
		dennis green and if you remember 
		doug williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a superbowl

				  debi
		youre a government spook

				  martin
		then i started losing my taste for

	shooting the skillet takes two rounds before martin hammers 
	the assassins head with it debi and newberry arrive in the

	out of the stairwell blasting they unload at each other as
