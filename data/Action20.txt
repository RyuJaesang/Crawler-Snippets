     fade in

     perfect square of black

     we know that we are looking at something because its
     polished surface shimmers with light

     pulling back other squares are revealed the black and
     white tiles of a chess board

     the board rises and spins slipping beneath us we find
     ourselves moving across the board moving through a chess
     game

     the pieces are everywhere checking and covering other
     pieces  it has reached that critical moment when pieces
     are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies
     unravel towards a final outcome

     standing above the pieces around him we see the black
     king

     we move closer towards his face closer to his chiseled
     ebony features closer until we are staring into his cold
     black eyes

                                                dissolve to

     ext marsh  sunglasses  dusk

     the red setting sun is reflected in the black lens

     two men are tromping through the calfdeep mud of an end
     less marsh  it is fall the first frost not far away and
     the foliage is brown and bare  with the redorange ball
     of fire melting into the horizon the two men at first
     appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
     mire

     the man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man
     he is very welldressed in a dark suit  a 22 caliber
     gun fitted with a long silencer dangles from his hand

     his name is robert rath

     the other man is willie ketcham  he is also wearing a
     very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
     brambles and mud

     as he lifts his foot his gucci shoe is sucked off by the
     mud

                             ketcham
               awshit!

     he balances on one leg holding his silksocked foot in
     the air  he looks at the shoe already filling with mud
     he looks at rath

                             ketcham
               how much farther

                             rath
               just a little ways  up to those
               trees

     about a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
     is a small cluster of trees

                             ketcham
               oh fuck it

     he pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud
     he smiles  it feels good  he hurls the sock  lifting
     his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that  he
     grabs for the other sock struggling to get it off
     laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud

     rath waits a faint smile

     he manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
     both feet into the dark wet earth

                             ketcham
               hey this feels kinda good

     they move on ketcham almost playing sinking his feet
     deep pulling them out to make a splurching sucking noise

                             ketcham
               hey do you mind if i talk a
               little  i feel like i dont
               know talking i guess

                             rath
               sure

                             ketcham
               funny ive never been a talker
               my wife was always getting on me
               about that  say what you feel
               tell me whats bothering you
               you ve got to talk to me  i
               never would though  not really

                               rath
               why not

                               ketcham
               i dont know  part of me wanted
               to but part of me always said
               whats she going to be able to
               do  i dont know  maybe i
               didnt trust her

     he picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
     snowball

                             ketcham
               my margaret i loved her but you
               know what  i cheated on her  all
               the time  i dont even know why
               it wasnt the sex margaret was
               great in bed  i think if i wasnt
               married i wouldnt have even looked
               at some of those women  i knew she
               couldnt trust me so how could i
               trust her  if she was here right
               now id think that i would tell her
               that i was sorry course if she
               were here right now maybe i
               wouldnt feel like talking

     he throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
     too far

                             ketcham
               i think ive heard of you

                             rath
               its possible

                             ketcham
               youre pretty famous arent you

                             rath
               i hope not

                             ketcham
               i know this may seem like a strange
               question but can i ask you how
               much the contract was for  not
               to insult you or anything i know
               youre a professional but just
               for me i was just wondering

                             rath
               its a common question

                             ketcham
               oh yeah  i guess we still need to
               see that price tag  like art
               right  you hang some painting
               that looks like babypuke in your
               living room only if it costs a
               bundle

                             rath
               a dime

                             ketcham
               one hundred thousand  thats it
               jesus is that a lot

                             rath
               average

                             ketcham
               shit oh well

     ketcham laughs

                             ketcham
               i have been thinking about this
               for a long while  i knew this day
               was coming  i knew someday
               someone would make the call on me
               i never thought about anyone that
               i had whacked  what do you call
               it anyway

                             rath
               taken

                             ketcham
               taken  thats nice  when i had
               someone taken i would call our
               general contractor transfer the
               money and as soon as i hung up the
               phone i forgot about them

                             rath
               everyone who plays the game knows
               the rules

                             ketcham
               thats exactly what i told myself

     ketcham laughs again  he is getting kind of giggly like
     hes high

                             ketcham
               i always wondered what id be
               thinking at this exact moment  i
               imagined that i would be thinking
               about the fucker who contracted
               this trying to figure out who
               it was

     something occurs to him and he looks back at rath

                             rath
               dont know  thats how it works

                             ketcham
               thats what our general contractor
               told us but how can you trust
               someone like that

                             rath
               right

                             ketcham
               i thought that i would be thinking
               about margaret or work or that
               id be having these deep profound
               and depressing thoughts but im
               not  im trying to think really
               profound thoughts but i cant
               it seems very funny to me

                             rath
               what are you thinking about

                             ketcham
               im thinking about moonpies  aint
               that funny  i havent had a
               moonpie since i was ten years old
               right now im thinking how much
               id love one

                             rath
               and an rc

     hes laughing and rath laughs with him  ketcham suddenly
     stops laughing  they are nearly to the cluster of trees

                             ketcham
               can i ask you something

                             rath
               go ahead

                             ketcham
               what do other guys do

     he looks at the trees his voice dying in the wind

                             rath
               everyone handles it differently
               some are ready some are not

                             ketcham
               do they get down on their knees
               begging and crying

                             rath
               some

                             ketcham
               when i thought about this that
               was always there in the back of
               my head that image of me on my
               knees crying  it wouldnt go
               away and it would really upset me
               it was something that i could never
               get away from but now i feel
               its okay  i feel good

                             rath
               can i ask you a question

                             ketcham
               anything

                             rath
               why didnt you fade

                              ketcham
               you mean quit

                              rath
               yeah

                              ketcham
               i used to think about it  i had
               margaret  she wanted kids  i
               thought about moving somewhere
               far away like europe  i could
               see all of that the first part
               the getting away but i couldnt
               see that next part  then what
               so id stop thinking about it and
               go back to work  you understand

                             rath
               yeah

     ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
     trees

                             ketcham
               i always pictured that i would end
               in some land fill under
               someone elses garbage  i kept
               picturing those plastic diapers
               filled with some babys green shit
               covering me  but this is nice

     he looks at the sun bloody red seeping into the black
     horizon

                               ketcham
               look at that  i havent watched
               the sun set in a million years
               do you mind

                             rath
               no

     ketcham stares at the last of the light

                             ketcham
               nice real nice

     with his face hidden from rath he begins to cry

     rath watches ketcham staring at the setting sun  rath
     looks down at the gun limply held in his hand

     when the sun is gone a red glow at the bottom of a dark
     ening sky we hear the gun silenced once then the body
     falling into the mud  after a beat we hear two more
     shots

     ketcham is lying face down already sinking into the mud
     a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
     left by the dying sun

     rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly stand
     ing alone in the middle of nowhere


     int hotel suite  night

     the room is dark and still

     a man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
     amber wash of urban light

     snow is falling heavy white flakes glittering in the
     citys electric night

     the man finishes his bourbon ice clinking in the empty
     glass  he is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
     his forehead rests against the window

     in the dim light we recognize the man as rath

     outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
     christmas  he watches the snowflakes drift to the
     distant street below

     he is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
     fall when there is a knock at the door

     crossing the room he opens the door  backlit by the
     bright hallway light is a woman  she has already removed
     her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see
     that her dress is very short and very tight

                             escort woman
               hi  did you call 

                             rath
               yes  please come in

     her high heels tap against the tile foyer as she enters
     and he takes her coat

                             escort
               goodness its so dark

     she reaches for the wall switch but he stops her

                             rath
               i prefer it like this

                             escort
               how can a beautiful man like you
               be shy

     he smiles

                             rath
               i prefer it thats all

     she moves closer to him the sexual confidence of her
     body radiating like heat

                             escort
               its okay honey  we can do it
               anyway you want

     rath is obviously uncomfortable

                             rath
               would you like a drink

                             escort
               id love one  whatever youre
               having

     they move into the room from a distance as featureless
     as two shadows

     she stands at the windows watching the snowbubble of a
     city night

                             escort
               beautiful

     he hands her the drink  her smile is bright and perfect

                             escort
               good will towards men

     their glasses clink as he drains half his drink  if she
     drinks at all we can not tell

                             rath
               why are you working today

                             escort
               holidays are our busiest days  no
               one likes to be alone on holidays
               i know i dont

     she touches his face the caress and her expression of
     tenderness seemingly genuine

                             rath
               youre very good at this arent
               you

                             escort
               i think youre supposed to answer
               that question

     her hand slides down his chest but before it goes any
     farther rath turns away returning to the bar

                             rath
               i know what you expect but i
               dont want

     he pours himself another drink

                             escort
               thats okay hon i always expect
               the unexpected

                             rath
               i called because i just want i
               need to talk

     she sits on the couch her body language changing as she
     becomes a listener

                             rath
               ive been thinking about my life
               about things i have done what i
               do for a living is in some ways
               similiar to what you do

     he sits on the other end of the couch his words thickened
     by the alcohol

                             rath
               i know that everything has a
               price  i want you to understand
               that im willing to pay

     he takes out an envelope and puts it between them  she
     picks it up glancing inside at a stack of hundred
     dollar bills

                             escort
               for what

               questions

     uncomfortable she waits as he searches his drink for
     the right words

                             rath
               do you ever regret things youve
               done

     rath nods  his next question is barely audible

     closes her eyes

               and what if you never meet that

     int hotel suite  night

     it is the same room but now it is very cluttered room
     service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about

     he has been here for a while

     he is sitting at the table staring intensely at a chess
     game we see the board and all of the pieces set in the
     same positions as in the opening sequence

     he rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
     then finishes off another bottle of bourbon

     he flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
     over the board and moves one of white knights taking a
     black rook

     a sequence begins obvious and he works through it moving
     both the black and white pieces  suddenly he stops  he
     gets up and shifts to the other side of the board
     studying the game from whites perspective

     another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
     it as he moves around the table returning to his place
     behind the black king

     the games reaches its end as black is checkmated

     he slumps down onto the table and looks across at the
     white king

                             rath
               fuck you nick


     int hotel suite  dawn

     rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer
     office a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with
     cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax
     machine and the latest highpowered laptop computer

     on the table near the desk we see the 22 dismantled
     and cleaned spread out on a white towel

     he types in a complicated access code sequence then
     waits staring at the blank screen

                             contractor/screen
               where have you been robert

                             rath/screen

               are the best contracts  to stop
               now would be selfdestructive

     he looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on
     the table

                             rath/screen
               send the file  ill have the

                             rath/screen
               dont be

     on the screen the word transmitting appears  rath
     slowly gets out of his chair

     the fax machine clicks and huxs to life as a photograph
     of a smiling old italian man curls onto the desk

     rath begins destroying the hotel room smashing anything
     he can get his hands on


     int hotel suite  day

     rath is in the middle of the room which he has
     demolished  having showered and shaved he is now
     standing naked in the midst of the rubble practicing
     the slow and graceful art of tai chi


     int hotel suite  night

     rath is working at the desk  he is tallying numbers
     materials totaling his estimate

     spread out over the table are several faxed photos of
     the old italian leevio valli usually surrounded by
     bodyguards

     the file details vallis life and his daily routine  it
     includes  phone bills credit card and bank account
     statements driver license and vehicle registration the
     real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his
     income tax return

     satisfied with his figures rath plugs the phone into the
     modem and makes a call

     the network comes online as the general contractor
     types

                             contractor/screen
               youre too late robert

     rath types

                             rath/screen
               what

                             contractor/screen
               the contract was stolen

     rath stares at the screen

                             rath/screen
               who

                             contractor/screen
               a new player  hes using the name
               nicholai

     the name hits rath and he sits unable to breathe

                             contractor/screen
               you know what must be done

     the screen goes black as the network shuts down

     rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts  he lifts
     a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant
     appears every friday  the name of the restaurant has been
     circled in red pen by rath  trattoria roma


     ext trattoria roma  night

     a red awning spans the entrance of a popular italian
     restaurant


     int trattoria roma

     it is a large establishment with many tables and booths
     the dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older italian
     families who have been eating here for years

     rath is sitting alone at a booth  with very subtle
     changes to his appearance he looks like an older italian

     in front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine
     he touches neither of them  his eyes shift as he studies
     the room

     leevio valli pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five
     gorillas in italian suits  the owner hurries to greet
     them hugging kissing speaking only italian

     the entourage moves through the restaurant to the over
     sized booth in the back

     rath does not look twice at them  immediately he is
     watching everyone else looking for the other assassin

     leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit
     around the table obscuring him from all parts of the
     room

     a wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and
     fills their glasses  a pretty waitress sets a steaming
     loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in
     front of leevio  he tells her something and she giggles
     they joke in italian watching her ass as she wiggles back
     to the kitchen

     at leevios table the wine steward returns to fill their
     glasses

     it is the goon standing against the wall that is the first
     to realize that it is not the same wine steward  he is
     the second assassin much younger than rath  his name is
     bain  he smiles

     the goon reaches for his gun as 

     bain shatters the bottle of wine into his face  he
     screams

     leevio coughs a spray of minestrone as a gun flashes free
     from the white linen towel hung over the stewards arm

     it happens instantly  four shots and the goons are dead

     leevio screams

                             leevio
               dont!

     a fifth sixth and seventh shot

     leevios body falls forward and softly thuds on the table

     bain whips around drawing a small semiautomatic weapon
     from his belt expecting an attack

     facing the screaming crowd he begins to shoot anyone who
     moves or stands men or women

     there is chaos in the restaurant  people scream falling
     to the ground scrambling under tables

     bain is sweating his eyes shifting wildly from one end of
     the room to the other

     the restaurant falls quiet except for several people who
     are sobbing

     he moves through the room watching searching

                             bain
               dont anybody move  you move
               youre dead

     he passes the table rath was sitting at but it is empty

                             bain
               come on you chicken shit
               motherfucker  i know youre here
               lets go

     across the street from trattoria roma rath jacks together
     a german assault rifle with night scope


     int trattoria roma

     bain looks out the window at the dark street

     he turns and searches through the people huddled on the
     floor  he aims his gun

                             bain
               you!  get up!

     a quivering wine steward stands

     he points to another

                             bain
               you too!  up!


     ext parking garage

     through the night scope we see the front door to the
     restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped
     together slowly back out

     bain is second from the end both guns aimed at the
     stewards

     one of them begins to cry

                             bain
               not yet  dont move or youre
               fucking dead

               shit  just do them all  all of
               them  shit

               now run!

     like dogs out of the gate they bolt


     int parking garage

     rath watches as they scatter finding bain in his scope


     ext street

     a chunk of brick explodes from the wall just behind bains
     head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the
     curb  he laughs  we get the idea that bain is enjoying
     this


     int parking garage

     rath looks over his scope talking to himself  he is
     sweating

                             rath
               shit  what are you doing old man
               youre too fucking slow

     he looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line
     of cars

                              rath
               okay  which one  which one is
               yours


     ext city street

     bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars
     staying low and out of sight

     he works his way up to a black mercedes that is parked
     illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys
     he hits the remote unlocking the doors


     int parking garage

     rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope almost obscured
     by the parked mercedes

                             rath
               amateur

     he takes aim


     ext city street

     just as bain starts to open the door the front tire
     explodes  another second the back tire explodes

                             bain
               fuck!


     int parking garage

     rath waits steely calm his finger on the trigger

               your move


     ext city street

     bain hears the growing wail of police sirens  thinking
     for a moment he opens the car door and pulls a long
     handled switchblade and a roll of electricians tape from
     the glove compartment


     int parking garage

     rath sees the car light go on but cant make out what
     bain is doing  the sirens are getting louder  theres a
     lot of them


     ext city street

     bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls
     his shirt sleeve down  from his pocket he takes out a
     gameboy and begins playing tetris


     int parking garage

     rath watches as the police cars come racing down the
     street


     ext city street

     the cars screech to a halt in front of the restaurant
     the cops jump out drawing their weapons

     bain throws his guns down raising his hands in the air

                             bain
               dont shoot!  dont shoot!  i give
               up!

     more cars come screeching up as the two officers hold
     their beads on bain

                             cop
               hit the ground!  face down!  spread
               your legs!

     bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him
     frisking him  in this position the cop is unable to find
     the knife strapped to bains forearm but finds the
     gameboy

                             bain
               hey dont touch that!

                             cop
               shut up!

     the cop twists bains arms behind his back handcuffing
     him tightly

     they drag him to his feet a swarm of police and
     paramedics in the street


     int parking garage

     rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the
     police car but is unable to get a clean shot  bain is
     using the cops for cover keeping his head low

                             rath
               son of a bitch

     the cops shove bain into the back seat

     rath very quickly walks to his car tossing his gun into
     the trunk  he gets in and starts the engine


     int patrol car

     the two officers are outside the car talking with the
     sergeant

     bain laying low beneath the windows peeks up at the
     shadowy parking garage  he smiles

     the two policemen get in the car the second picking up
     the radio  the driver guns the engine and the black and
     white rumbles down the street

                             cop #2
               this is 181 returning with suspect
               involved in multiple shooting at
               trattoria roma  repeat en route
               with suspect

     he hangs up the radio and looks back at bain through the
     metal caging

                             cop #2
               jesus christ do you know who you
               shot in there

     bain almost laughs

                             cop #2
               what are you  some kind of a
               hitman

     bain looks out the window

                             cop #2
               you know what we call guys like you

     bain looks at him

               sizzle lean  theyre gonna fry your
               ass

     he laughs at his own joke looking at his partner who
     chuckles

     raths car races down the street trying to catch up with
     the patrol car


     int patrol car

     bain stares out the window silent

     behind his back he takes hold of his left thumb with his
     right hand

     the cop is playing with the gameboy

     with a quick jerk he yanks the thumb out of its socket
     his expression remains perfectly blank

     the thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand  the skin
     stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his
     wrist

     the cop turns as the switchblade clicks and bain sticks
     the knife through the wire mesh into the cops eye  a
     font of blood arcs onto the windshield

     grabbing hold of the drivers shirt collar bain jabs the
     blade into the back of his neck

     the driver screams trying to pull free of bains grip

     he slams on the brakes groping for his gun and the car
     skids out of control

     bain stabs the cop again his gun firing wildly as 

     the patrol car starts to flip and roll

     headlights roll up behind him  the car gets closer the
     lights brighter they dont stop

     he shrieks as the car smashes into his tearing off his
     bumper

     the cabby jumps out rattling off a string of obscenities

     rath gets out of the white car starting to apologize as
     the cabby moves toward him

     when hes close enough rath decks him knocking him
     unconscious

     he picks him up and puts him in the white car

     rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
     green he drives off

     rath circles the area turning up the cabs cb

     a couple of calls crackle through the speaker before he
     hears what hes waiting for an airport fare in this area
     at the intersection of adams and nine

     he picks up the mike

                              rath
               this is 1242  i got it


     ext adams and nine

     it is a deserted intersection  the buildings are dark and
     some of the street lights are out

     the cab sits by itself engine running its taillights
     glowing through the exhaust


     int cab

     rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat  his other
     hand grips the door handle

     as he waits watching the intersection he notices the
     cabbys id pinned to the dashboard

     leaving the gun in his jacket he reaches for the id card

     he rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the
     seat the door behind him opens  someone gets in and
     closes the door  rath peers into the rearview mirror

     it is bain

     for the first time we realize that the front and back of
     the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass

     there is an awkward silence as rath sits unsure

     bain looks at him

                             bain
               is there a problem

                             rath
               no  no problem  the airport
               right

                             bain
               right

     the cab pulls out of the intersection


     int cab

     rath studies bain  there is a thin line of blood down his
     temple  bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his
     gameboy resuming his game of tetris

                             rath
               howd you cut yourself

     their voices are distorted through the small electric
     amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal
     money exchanger

     bain touches the blood on his forehead looking at it a
     bit surprised

                             bain
               oh  working  a little accident

     he wipes it off as best he can

                             rath
               you a waiter  you look like a
               waiter

     bain is uninterested

                             bain

               where you from

                             rath
               since you looked like a waiter i
               had to ask what restaurant because
               of what happened at the trattoria
               roma

     bain looks up

                             bain
               why  what happened

               that sob right to the chair

     bain allows himself a bemused smile

                             bain
               sizzle lean

     the cab passes the intersection for the airport

     bain sits up

                             bain
               what are you doing

                             rath

               that was peterson back there  that
               goes to the expressway for the
               airport

                             rath
               youre right  talking too much
               again

                             bain
               yeah well you just blew your tip
               pal

                             rath

                             bain
               just do your job

     rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park

                             bain
               what are you doing

                             rath
               get out  you think im running you
               up  get out

                             bain
               you cant 

                             rath

               dont like you  so get the hell
               out!

     bain cant figure out what is wrong when he sees the
     dashboard and the missing id

     their eyes meet in the rearview mirror

                             bain
               holy fucking shit!

     the cab rocks as both men move  instantly guns fill their
     hands  bain ripping out a 357 lifted from one of the
     dead cops  rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free
     from his jacket

     bain throws open the door about to run but stops  he
     looks at rath  he wants him to run  anyone who moves
     away from the bullet proof glass is dead

     both men are silent each holding the other in their gun
     sights

     bain blinks sweat forming on his lip

                             bain
               i get out you got me

     bain reaches over and closes the door  he smiles knowing
     it is the right move

                             bain
               now what

     rath calmly uncocks his gun

                             rath
               were both going to the airport

     bain nods

                             rath
               sit back  put your seatbelt on

                             bain
               no fucking way

                             rath
               okay dont

     bain thinks

                             rath
               if either of us fucks around the
               other can blow the fuel line

     he points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs

     bain sits back aiming his gun watching rath

     rath eases back into the drivers seat also holding his
     gun on the fuel line

     he puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic
     turning back towards peterson

     they sit in silence studying each other when they hit
     the expressway  bain cant contain himself giddy on
     adrenaline

                             bain
               jesus  im being driven to the
               airport by robert rath

     he laughs

                             bain
               i cant believe this  you rolled
               some cabby for the radio then
               waited for an airport fare

     he laughs again

                             bain
               boy thats fucking genius  youre
               a fucking genius  then youre just

               not nicholai

                             bain
               holy shit!  robert rath wants to
               know my name

     he leans back  this is a big moment for him

                             bain
               bain  michael bain

                             rath
               how long have you been freelance

                             bain
               two years  two long fucking years

     something occurs to him and he leans close to the window

                             bain
               hey  what i dont get was why
               didnt you take the shot inside the
               restaurant  i mean you had me a

               done

                             rath
               its just a shootout then  sixty
               forty at best  not my odds

                             bain
               sounds like chickenshit 

     he laughs hard

                             bain
               listen to me calling you
               chickenshit!

     he stops laughing and looks closely at the back of raths
     head

                             bain
               is that a wig  shit i hate wigs!
               wigs are the worst part of this job
               id rather dye my hair than wear a
               wig

     rath studies him

                             rath
               youre wearing a wig now

     bain chokes on his laugh

                             bain
               god damn are you good  everyone
               says youre so fucking good  i just

               you just didnt plug us all when we
               came through the door

     rath does not answer  bain smiles  he knows something
     about rath now he doesnt like killing innocent people

                             bain
               shit if i was you back there 

     he holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind raths
     head

                             bain
               game over

     he laughs

                             bain
               do you mind if i ask you a couple of
               business questions  you know i was
               wondering how much you bid this job
               at

     rath says nothing

                             bain
               you dont have to tell me that
               its just i know my bid was low
               but was it too low  i mean did i
               seem like an amateur like i didnt

                             rath
               we both know what you were doing

     bain moves close to the glass again checking out raths
     gun

                             bain
               smith and wesson 22 with an eight
               inch silencer  classic  when i
               first heard you used that i
               thought shit thats a ladys gun
               now its all i use  clean real
               clean

     he looks at the gun still trained at the floor

                             bain
               would you really blow us

     rath does not have to answer

                             bain
               oh!  i got a question  jesus this

               nicholai talinkov 

                             rath
               tachlinkov

                             bain

               best and that you planted his ass

     rath says nothing

                             bain
               i bet im right

     the car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the
     cleveland airport

                             bain
               robert bain driving me!  jesus
               fucking christ!

                             rath
               after those cops youll never be
               able to come back to cleveland

                             bain
               who the fuck cares about cleveland
               cleveland blows  what kind of marks

               politician  i want the money marks
               i want the marks that you get

     a long beat of silence

     the cab rumbles up onto the departures ramp which
     circles past all of the terminals

                             bain
               so what happens now

                             rath
               we go around once

                             bain
               bullshit

     he throws off his seatbelt

                             bain
               you tell me that were gonna go
               around once then while im
               checking out the lay of the land
               you bail out and send me flying over
               the bridge  right  am i right

     rath doesnt answer studying the terminals noting the
     police and airport security

     rath studies the terrain  bain studies rath

     soon they have passed the entire airport  rath nods
     steering the car through traffic in onto a circle
     interchange that will bring them to the beginning

     bain wipes the sweat from his face

                             rath
               okay

                             bain
               what  whats okay

     rath begins to accelerate rounding the interchange

                             bain
               what are you doing

                             rath
               theres a sand barricade up ahead
               im going to ram this cab into it
               the cab has an airbag odds are good
               ill survive  but with this steel
               casing and bullet proof glass odds
               for you are not so good

     bain laughs

                             bain
               oh man thats sweet  thats
               fucking sweet

     the speedometer continues to climb

                             bain
               youre bluffing

     rath says nothing  ahead at the ramp to the terminals
     is the sand barricade

                             bain
               youre fucking with me  you want me
               to jump  i jump you hit the brakes
               and bang  game over

     the cab is flying at its target

                             bain
               no no  wait  you dont want me to
               jump  youre going to jump  im
               stuck back here until its too late
               wham  over!

                             rath
               i know youre going to jump

     bain looks at him and then at the barricade

                             rath
               youre still young  young enough to
               still think youre indestructible
               invincible  you believe with utter
               certainty you can bail out at the
               last second and survive

     the barricade hurtles toward them rising up filling the
     windshield

                             rath
               if you do survive well see each
               other again

     bain screams throwing open the door and hurling himself
     out

     rath jams on the brakes tires screaming steering into
     the steel side rail banking the car into the drums of
     sand as 

     bain hits the pavement bouncing like a stone skipped
     across water

     a driver hits his brakes swerving just missing him

     sand explodes from the impact and the cab bounces up over
     the median into the busonly lanes as the drivers airbag
     balloons out of the steering wheel

     bain rolls and rolls finally stopping sprawled out like a
     piece of roadkill

     the cab careens up onto a curb slamming into a pole the
     radiator spitting out a cloud of whistling steam

     several cars lock up and collide to avoid bain one car
     stopping inches from him  a woman jumps out rushing to
     the front of the car but bain is gone

     police cars roar up into the midst of the accident  one
     of them pulling alongside the demolished cab  the door is
     open the airbag popped  rath is gone


     ext apartment building  day

     a large six flat leans out from a hill in san francisco


     int electras apartment  day

     the apartment is always dark heavy drapes cover the
     windows

     the dining and living rooms look like the control booth of
     a network television show stacks of video monitors and
     consoles cables electric wiring coils of fiber optic
     cord ducttaped to the floors walls and ceilings  they
     snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang
     everywhere like some technological jungle

     at the center of this tangled web is electra a beautiful
     athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a
     worn robe  she is curled up in an overstuffed chair a
     bowl of popcorn in her lap

     on the monitors she is watching what at first might be
     mistaken for a soap opera a young couple are having an
     argument

     what is strange is that the angle never changes a fish
     eye lens staring down into the room

                             man vo
               i dont give a shit what your mother
               thinks  im not sleeping with your
               mother im sleeping with you

                             woman vo
               you wont be for long with that
               attitude

                             man vo
               jesus jennifer if youre so god
               damned worried about your mothers
               approval why dont you move back
               home so she can pat you on the head
               when you do something right

                             electra
               jerk

     jennifer is too stunned to say anything  there is a long
     pause that is not at all like television  it seems very
     real

     she starts to say something but stops trying to keep
     herself from crying

                             man vo
               oh good  go ahead and cry

                             jennifer woman vo
               would you please leave

     electra lifts her head smelling the air

                             electra
               mmm smell that nikita

     nikita electras black cat is stretched lazily across
     the top of a chair her tail twitching absently  every
     corner of the chair has been clawed open

     electra reaches for the control board and throws a series
     of switches

     the monitors flicker as the image changes  we are now
     looking down into a kitchen  a stove is beneath us
     almost like a cooking show where a round woman is taking
     out a tray of chocolate chip cookies

     electra smells them again smiling as she inhales

                             electra
               i hope she saves some for us

     there is a bang a door slamming in another apartment and
     a man yelling

     electra switches back to jennifers apartment

     the man is still in the living room but jennifer is gone

                             man vo
               do you think slamming doors is going
               to help work this out

     electra punches a command into a keyboard  several of the
     screens change showing different rooms of the same
     apartment  jennifer is in the bedroom lying on the bed
     sobbing her face buried in a pillow

                             man vo
               i can slam doors too!

     we hear the front door slam in the hall outside of
     electras apartment and through the monitor speakers  his
     stomping footsteps fade as he storms down the hall and
     staircase out of the building

     electra switches all of the screens to jennifer

     she watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom

     electra reaches out her fingers lightly touch the monitor
     screen


     int apartment hall

     electras front door opens slowly  timidly she steps out
     of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is
     standing in front of jennifers door

     she starts to knock but stops herself  she isnt sure
     she should do this

     she paces then turns to the door

     she knocks so softly its almost impossible to hear

     she stands trying to force herself to knock again when
     she hears jennifer

                             jennifer os
               hello  ken is that you

     electra panics

     the door knob turns the door opens and jennifer looks out
     into the hall  it is empty


     int electras apartment

     on the monitors electra watches jennifer pick up the
     phone

                             jennifer vo
               hi mom its me  ken and i just
               had a big fight

     electras pager suddenly sounds  she shuts down the
     screens and pulls out the pager checking the number

                             electra
               crap


     int electras apartment

     there is a system set up that is not unlike raths system
     all of the same components though the equipment is
     bigger more powerful and less portable

     on a table there is a bank of phones several cellular
     electra is talking on one

                             woman vo
               electra they are not paying you to
               sit at home and watch television

     electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks each
     has a microcell trademark and is labeled backup

                             electra
               i wasnt watching television

                             woman vo
               the point is they are paying for
               information  real information  not
               tooth paste brands  not whether he
               wads of folds his toilet paper  and
               no 16 hours of recorded phone sex
               you are wasting everyones time with
               this shit

                             electra
               i thought it was interesting 

                             woman vo
               god damnit electra  this is not a
               game  this is business

               backup disks he made of all of his
               work last night

               expect my usual bonus

                             woman vo
               electra 

                             electra
               a pleasure doing business with you

     she hangs up


     int lobby

     electra comes down the stairs

     outside the large glass door she sees ken jennifers
     boyfriend leaving

     on the lobby floor is a letter apparently slipped under
     the door addressed to jennifer morgan

     electra looks out the front door window making sure that
     ken is gone

     she picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket


     int hotel suite  night

     rath is at his computer system

     he is staring at it like it is a living thing a person
     that he despises the blank screen reflecting his own
     face  it is an effort to bring himself to touch the
     keyboard to type in his code

     he waits

                             contractor/screen
               hello robert

     rath wants to type something but hesitates

                             rath

                             contractor/screen
               it cost us

     rath jumps out of his chair screaming at the screen

                             rath
               i give a fuck  im done!  i quit!

                             contractor/screen
               he stole another contract

     rath turns from the monitor pacing  trying to collect
     himself

                             rath
               im being set up  fucking set up!

     he looks at the chess board  he hovers over it the
     pattern completely familiar

                             rath
               is this how it went nick

                             contractor/screen
               robert  robert

     rath turns back to the screen speaking as he types

                             rath/screen
               how did he know

                             contractor/screen

               such language in front of a lady

     rath still talking and typing

                             rath/screen
               i dont know what the fuck you are

                             contractor/screen

     rath stands no longer typing

                             rath
               a joke  a joke

     rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the
     screen

                             rath
               you think this is a fucking joke

                             contractor/screen
               $1000000

     rath looks at the number

                             contractor/screen
               thats the bonus on the contract

     rath puts the gun down

                             rath/screen

     the fax machine comes to life printing an inky image

                             rath/screen
               who is the mark

                             contractor/screen

               we have an mo her system is
               protected by her pussy virus

     rath looks at the fax almost entirely black except for
     the wide slitiris cat eyes


     ext san francisco airport  day

     there is a screech and blast of engines as a 747 touches
     down heat rising off the tarmac


     int san francisco airport  day

     several passengers walk through the gate into the
     terminal

     across from the gate rath sits in a grungy airport
     cafeteria reading a folded paper

     he is wearing an airport security uniform a gun holstered
     to his side

     taped inside the newspaper is a faxed interpol photograph
     of a japanese man wanted for industrial espionage

     at the gate five japanese men emerge  leading the group
     is the man in raths photo  the other four are obviously
     muscle

     rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall
     when they are almost out of sight he folds his newspaper
     and begins to follow

     his pace and manner is that of a cautious predator  his
     focus shifts continually from face to face expecting to
     find bains

     his hand hovers near his gun

     ahead of him a thin young man wearing a long blue trench
     coat stops  rath cannot see his face

     the man starts toward a drinking fountain

     rath catches a glimpse of his face  it could be bain but
     he isnt sure

     the young man bends over and slurps at the stream of
     water  he rises into the barrel of raths 22

     a mouthful of water coughs from his mouth

     it is not bain and in the next instant the gun is gone

                             rath
               sorry  my mistake

     rath continues  they young man is unable to move


     ext san francisco airport  day

     the five men stride through the automated terminal doors
     and towards a waiting limousine

     further down rath now wearing a black tshirt and jeans
     exits and hails a cab


     int cab

                             rath
               hi  up ahead my boss is in that
               black limo  were not sure which
               hotel were at so could you just
               follow them

                             cabby
               sure

     rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as
     the cab pulls away


     int limousine

     the five men sit in silence  strangely a phone begins to
     ring

     the older man whose name is akira opens his briefcase
     removing a cellular phone

                             akira
               hello

     we hear electras voice  she speaks in japanese he uses
     english

                             electra vo
               i trust your flight was comfortable

                             akira
               your japanese is excellent

                             electra vo
               tell the driver  the hyatt hotel


     int hotel room  day

     electra is pacing talking into the cellular phone

                             electra
               ill call you again in twenty
               minutes

     she punches a button and shoves the antennae down

     the hotel room looks like her apartment  there is a
     computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the
     wood laminate desk  cables whip and wind across the
     carpeted floor to the central air duct

     the panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray
     coaxial run up inside the duct

     immediately electra is busy finishing her preparations
     she snaps in several power cords and the system comes on
     line

     on the monitor screen we see an empty hotel room that
     looks exactly like the one she is in


     int cab

     rath stares out the window watching the surrounding
     traffic the limo still in sight

     something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded
     newspaper where he had hid the contract file

     he flips past several documents before finding what hes
     looking for the cat

     he pulls the dark fax of nikita and stares at it


     int hotel room

     laying on the bed in a patch of sunlight nikita watches
     electra rush about

     electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks
     it out

                             electra
               excuse me your highness

     nikita casually walks off the bed

     electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a
     long piece of ducttape


     ext hyatt hotel

     the limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway

     the cab pulls in behind it


     int hotel room

     electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone


     int hyatt lobby

     the japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and
     uncomfortable

     the briefcase rings


     int hotel room

     electra is pacing again

                             electra
               room 1414


     int hyatt lobby

     with several other guests the japanese men crowd into an
     elevator  the doors close

     across the lobby rath enters walking past the elevators


     int elevator

     as the elevator rises we begin to hear a sound a
     familiar sound

     cramped in the corner is bain  he is playing tetris
     wearing dark sunglasses and a walkman pumping speed metal
     into his ears


     int hotel room

     electra continues to pace checking the monitors


     int room service kitchen

     at the switchboard a young hotel employee wearing an
     operators headset takes a late breakfast order typing
     the order in the hotel computer

                             young man young hotel employee
               yes sir  thatll be up in about
               thirty minutes  youre welcome

     he turns around and rath is right behind him


     int elevator

     the fourteenth floor the bell chimes the doors slide
     open and the clump of japanese men get out

     just as the doors begin to close bain steps out


     int hall

     bain follows them down the hall still playing the game
     there is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on
     its prey

     as akira finds 1414 and opens the door another door burst
     open a large family heading for the pool

     the moment is gone the japanese men close the door and
     bain continues down the hall again playing the game


     int hotel suite

     when the japanese men enter the suite we realize that
     this is the image on electras monitors  surveillance
     camcorders and microphones are mounted in various
     locations to display every inch of the room  the group
     hesitates for a moment under the electronic eyes

     the four goons have their hands in their jackets

     a small laptop computer sits on the coffee table humming
     softly  it is the only noise in the room until a speaker
     crackles

                             electra/speaker vo
               good morning gentlemen  i
               apologize for the arrangement but

     int room service kitchen

     the operator is unconscious slumped in the corner

     rath studies the hotel computer screen intently the
     information rolling by

     we see that it is the previous nights room service
     receipts

                             rath
               one vegetarian plate and a can of
               tuna fish  room 1014


     int hotel room

     electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men
     as she speaks into the microphone

                             electra
               ten thousand dollars per disk
               insert the first disk now

     on the monitor we see akira at the coffee table shove the
     first disk into the laptop disk drive


     int hotel suite

     akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a
     goon who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar
     bills down the central air duct

     the little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies


     int hyatt hall

     bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of
     tetris

     suddenly he stops

                             bain
               yes!

     the display of the game reads game over and
     congratulates bain on a new high score

     bain stands smiling  he puts the game in his pocket and
     starts down the hall


     int hotel room

     electra is crouched at the open duct grabbing another
     stack of money stuffing it into her bag

     a loud bang explodes out of the speakers and she looks up
     at the monitor


     int hotel suite

     the lock on the door has been broken and standing in the
     frame is bain

                             bain
               surprise!

     he raises his arm his gun spitting silent bullets


     int hotel room

     electra stares in horror at the monitors as bain grabs the
     nearest bodyguard firing a shot into his belly

                             electra
               oh god


     int hotel suite

     another shot and the second bodyguard falls  the other
     two draw their handguns and bain shields himself with the
     lifeless body of his first victim

     they fire at bain but are unable to hit him

     bain squeezes off two more shots and the two men fall
     dead  he lets his human shield fall to the ground and
     levels his gun on the shaking akira

                             akira
               dont kill me

     bain looks at him and smiles then fires


     int hotel room

     electra leaps at the computer ripping the cord from the
     modem

     bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it

                             bain vo
               tricky  boy you just cant trust
               anyone these days

     he licks the lens leaving a smear of saliva

     she stuffs the disks into her bag  she puts nikita in her
     travel kitty and charges for the door grabbing her
     coat

     flinging it over her shoulder she does not notice the
     letter from ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from
     the room


     int hall

     electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes
     she is staring down the barrel of raths 22

                             rath
               dont be stupid and you will live

     the elevator behind rath opens and closes against a hotel
     lobby ashtray  he waves her into the elevator with his
     gun

                             rath
               hurry


     ext hyatt hotel  day

     electras black car roars out of the garage onto the open
     street

     the door swings open  from the hall we can hear the
     familiar beeping of the computer game  the room 1014 is
     the same as electra had left it when she ran out

     jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of kens
     letter


     int electras car

     electra drives obviously nervous as rath watches out the
     rear window

                             rath
               turn here

     no one follows  he turns back to her

                             rath
               how many bodies were there

     he checks his watch

                             electra
               what

                             rath
               he has to clean up  how many bodies
               were there

                             electra

     int hyatt hotel room  day

     bain has returned to room 1414  wearing rubber gloves he
     clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of
     rug cleaner

     he picks up the phone for room service

                              bain
               hi  this is room 1414 

     behind him in the bathroom mirror we see one of the
     japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet  he is
     naked

                             bain
               yes could you send up a pot of
               coffee and my friends are going to
               need some more towels  thanks

     he hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large
     blood stains on the carpet  he points the rug cleaner at
     the stain covering it with white foam


     int electras car

               nowhere yet

     electra turns onto the highway and nikita howls from the

     he reaches into the back seat grabbing her bag

                             electra
               what do you think youre doing

               was one million dollars

     electra seems ready to jump out of her skin  the
     speedometer is floating around 90

                             rath
               slow down

     he pulls out the disks

                             rath

     int hotel suite  night

     the room is immaculate near the door several oversized
     suitcases line the wall

     bain is sitting at the desk  his walkman is on music
     blasting as he flips casually through the telephone
     directory

     his finger eases down a column stopping at morgan
     jennifer

     there is a knock at the door

     he smiles and tears out the page

     there is another louder knock which bain hears this time
     he turn off the walkman and opens the door a bellboy is
     waiting with a luggage cart

                             bellboy
               hello sir  have you some luggage
               you need carried

                             bain
               indeed i do


     int electras car  night

     the red low fuel light is on

                             electra
               now what

                             rath
               turn off the engine

     electra twists the ignition and the car dies  rath
     glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas
     station

                             electra
               you want me to pump

                             rath
               no stay in the car  i want you to
               understand something  if i intended
               to kill you you would already be
               dead

     electra says nothing

     he reaches over and takes the car keys

     when he is out of the car electra slowly releases the
     stranglehold she had on the steering wheel

                             electra
               okay nikita stay calm think
               breathe think

     electra checks the rear view mirror listening as rath
     pumps the gas  her eyes flash down to her bag

     outside rath watches electra through the windows  she
     appears motionless

     the electric gas counter races like a stop watch

     in the car electra eases her hand into her bag

     the tank full rath rehangs the pump  he walks around
     the car and heads for the station

     electra waits until his back is turned  she pulls her
     tool pouch from her bag throws it open and finds her wire
     stripper  reaching under the dash she yanks out a
     tangled handful of wire

     she looks up rath is inside paying

                             electra
               come on come on its a cake walk

     her fingers fly with surgical precision snipping
     stripping twisting

     rath steps out of the station as her head pops up looking
     for him  it takes only a second for him to realize what
     she is doing

                             rath
               oh shit

     he runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and
     strikes them the battery grinds

                             electra
               please please

     he is almost there when the engine fires  she stomps on
     the gas ramming the shift into drive

     tires squealing the car swerves forward as rath slams
     into it  he bounces backward falling to the ground

     the car fishtails away accelerating as rath rolls to one
     knee his gun automatically in his hand  he draws a bead
     but he does not shoot

     with a concerted effort he puts the gun away

                             rath
               dammit


     ext electras apartment building  night

     electras car is parked out front

     she unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside


     int electras apartment lobby

     standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is
     jennifer morgan  what she was hoping for is not there
     she looks up and sees electra

                             jennifer
               excuse me 

     electra stops

                             jennifer
               you live here dont you

     electra nods

                             jennifer
               im sorry this may sound really
               weird but my friend told me he
               slipped a letter under the door here
               and i was wondering if you happened
               to see it

     electra is in a daze her hand moving into her pocket

                             electra
               letter

                             jennifer
               yeah  he said he saw a woman with
               dark hair going into the building
               when he dropped it off

                             electra
               no  i dont have it

     electras mouth opens and she backs away  jennifer is
     bothered by her reaction and she doesnt push it

                             jennifer
               im sorry  i didnt mean to  im
               sorry

     she shrugs and unlocks the interior door leaving electra
     in the lobby

     electra watches her as her hand moves from pocket to
     pocket

     a worried expression tightens her face the letter is
     gone

     she opens the interior door following jennifer up the
     stairs


     int staircase

     electra climbs the stairs her mind pouring through the
     possibilities filled with fear

     by the time electra reaches the top floor jennifer is
     entering her apartment

     electra hurries past jennifers door to her own


     int electras apartment  night

     electra flies across the living room to the monitors

     she clicks them on putting on jennifers channel

     on the screen we see jennifer in her living room checking
     her phone messages  one from her mother

     electra throws a few switches so that jennifers entire
     apartment is in front of her

     on one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the
     oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room

     jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath

     electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out
     bain moves into the dining room where jennifer had just
     been

     wearing rubber surgeons gloves he picks up the mail that
     she had dropped on the table and sorts through it

     bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference
     to jennifers presence as if he were invisible as though
     he knew she couldnt see him

     he moves into a room just as she moves out

     electra watches dizzy sick with terror but she is
     unable to turn away

     bain searches through a desk drawer while jennifer starts
     undressing for her bath

     he walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom
     if jennifer would turn around she would see him

     electra is about to run to call out when 

     something catches bains eye

     he moves into the bedroom and is turned so that he is
     looking straight up into the camera

     he inches towards it not sure what it is  the fiber
     optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over
     the bed

     staring at it he is looking right at electra

     bain steps up onto the bed his face distorting as he
     moves close to the fisheye lens  poking it with his
     finger he realizes what it is  a warped smile stretches
     across his face as he whispers 

                             bain vo
               oh you sick little bitch 

     electra tears away from the screen panic seizing hold of
     her

     she rips entire drawers out of her dresser dumping them
     into a suitcase stuffing in anything that looks
     important  she grabs nikita in the travel kitty


     ext back porch

     the door opens and electra jumps out slamming it behind
     her as 

     bain turns from the back stairs

     she leaps back inside as he whips out his gun pumping two
     holes in the door


     int electras apartment

     she scrambles from the kitchen throwing her suitcase
     still clutching the travel kitty as 

     the back door explodes from its hinges bain charging
     firing his gun

     bullets hissing past her electra crashes through the
     front door into the hall


     int hall

     the stairs are at the far end  she is only halfway
     when 

     rath rises up the stairs his gun cocked

     electra drops to the floor as 

     behind her bain barrels from the apartment

     rath fires

     the wood door splinters bullet holes surrounding bain
     off balance he lunges back into the apartment

     rath continues firing grabbing hold of electra

     they run down the stairs


     ext rear staircase

     bain leaps down the flights


     ext alley

     bain rushes into the street looking in every direction
     they are gone

                             bain
               fuck me!


     ext large chain hotel  night

     somewhere in the city


     int hotel room

     electra and rath enter the room together but they are both
     immediately alone

     she walks across the room to a chair in the corner
     curling into it even as nikita jumps up and curls into her
     lap

     he sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of
     the room and sits

     they watch each other  silence

     between then is the liquor cabinet  rath knows a good
     idea when he sees one

                             rath
               want a drink

     her face is as expressionless as nikitas

     he pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down
     takes a deep breath then pours himself another one

                             rath
               okay

     he returns to his table with his drink

                             rath
               im not good at this sort of thing
               but we dont have a lot of time so
               ill just go ahead and get started
               first  you  i ask myself what is
               she thinking

     her body tightens coils

                             rath
               simple  shes scared  shes almost
               been killed twice and now she is
               alone in a room with a man that she
               believes is an assassin

     another deep pull on the bourbon

                             rath
               furthermore she was brought here not
               entirely on her own accord which
               only increases her fear and
               suspicion  thus as long as she is
               afraid her first maybe her only
               thought will be escape  does that
               leave me any other option

     he slugs down the rest of his drink and stands whipping
     out his gun

                             rath
               no

     crossing the room he turns the gun around and offers it
     to her  she looks at it  back at him

     he puts it on the bed beside her turns his back and walks
     to the bar

     she picks up the gun

                             rath
               the gun is silenced  she could
               shoot me right now

     she stands nikita jumping from her lap

                             rath
               she could take the car and be far
               from here before the maid comes in
               the morning but 

     she starts squeezing off rounds the lamp explodes the
     chairs around him erupt tufts of white stuffing leaping
     into the air

                             electra
               shut up!

     he freezes bottle in one hand glass in the other

                             electra
               stop trying to tell me what im
               thinking!

     she moves closer to him the gun squeezed in her fist

                             electra
               ill tell you what youre thinking
                you think im not going to shoot
               you but right now youre not so
               sure are you

     a slight shake of the head no

                             electra
               youre thinking that maybe it was a
               mistake to give me this gun that
               maybe im not going to think about
               things logically because im a woman
               and im freaked out and im going to
               do something impulsive and
               irrational  right

     she fires the gun to both sides of his head  hes
     surprised to be alive

                             electra
               you dont know shit about me!  now
               sit down!

     he returns to his chair and sits with the same expression
     she had worn sitting a moment ago

     she opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles
     of liquor  she sucks it all down and throws the bottle
     across the room

     grabbing another she sits on the edge of the bed

                             electra
               okay  how did you find me

                             rath
               youre the computer hacker you tell
               me

                             electra
               you didnt know anything about me

     nikita rubs up against her leg

                             electra
               nikita

                             rath
               yellow pages  v for veterinarian
               there arent that many

     she nods slurping at her bottle

                             electra
               youre one of them arent you

                             rath
               them

                             electra
               an assassin

                             rath
               until a minute ago

                             electra
               what does that mean

                             rath
               if i still was what i used to be
               you would not be pointing that at
               me

     electra eyes him considers shooting him right now

                             electra
               who is that other guy

                             rath
               another contractor

                             electra
               someone hired both of you

                             rath
               no  they hired bain  the contract
               would have been mine but bain took
               it from me as he took the previous
               one

                             electra
               so this is something between you and
               him

                             rath
               he stole the contract knowing that
               i would come after him

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               because he is trying to retire me

                             electra
               he wants to kill you

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               the nature of the business  you
               remove your competition

                             electra
               and you want to use me to get him

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               forget it!

                             rath
               we dont have a choice

     she fires the gun pocking the wall behind him

                             electra
               dont tell me i dont have a choice!

                             rath
               right

                             electra
               im two seconds away from making my
               choice which means youve got two
               seconds to tell me why i shouldnt
               shoot you

                             rath
               its simple  you need me  i need
               you  and we will both need money

                             electra
               i dont need you to get the money 
               my money!

                             rath
               if it hadnt been for me you would
               be dead

     shes up pacing knowing there is some truth in that

                             electra
               i dont need the money

                             rath
               this is something that is never
               going to end  you can never work in
               the business again with this
               contract because he will find you
               to survive you have to go into deep
               hiding  and thats going to take
               money a lot of money

                             electra
               then you can have the disks and ill
               just walk out that door 

                             rath
               if you walk out that door bain will
               still come after you

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               because he took a contract on you
               hell come for you and hell find
               you

                             electra
               you dont know that  youre trying
               to scare me
     
                             rath
               no  its the truth  i know what
               you are  like me like bain youre
               a ghost youre not part of the real
               world  you dont have a social
               security number  you dont pay
               taxes  youve probably used ten
               different names over the last ten
               years  a long time ago something
               probably happened something illegal
               and you ran you disappeared and it
               was easy  you think you can do it
               again  but im telling you fading
               from the law is nothing  no matter
               what you do where you go i swear
               to you that bain will find you

                             electra
               how

                             rath
               right now as we sit here he is
               tearing through your apartment  he
               is digging through your drawers
               emptying your closets  he will take
               your telephone and address books
               your appointment books  if you keep
               a diary he is reading it  hell go
               into the kitchen and find out what
               kind of food you eat liquor you
               drink cigarettes you smoke  in the
               bathroom he will find any
               prescription drugs you take and
               where you get them filled  if you
               have video tape or recordings he
               will watch and listen to all of
               them

     she is coming unglued  imagining him watching her tapes
     going through her possessions  she is moving pacing
     ready to explode

                             electra
               oh jesus jesus

                             rath
               he will know everything about you
               everything  i know because ive
               done it  once youve been inside a
               marks home youre in their head
               if youre any good youll find the
               mark in a week and bain is good
               because i was the best and i
               couldnt take him

     she whirls and starts firing the gun firing it
     everywhere fear and anger rocketing out of her in
     whistling hot wads of lead

     when she stops he starts to say something but she levels
     the gun at him

                             electra
               shut up!  all right!  youve said
               enough!

     she forces herself back grabbing handfuls of the sample
     bottles

                             electra
               i need to think to be alone

     with the gun and an armful of booze and nikita following
     at her feet she goes into the bathroom and slams the
     door


     int bathroom

     she locks the door and then collapses  her body seems to
     fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall the gun
     and the bottles falling from her arms clattering softly
     on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands


     int bedroom

     very mechanically rath begins setting up his chess board
     putting the pieces into the same positions  it is a
     ritual and with it he enters a kind of trance

     from the bathroom almost inaudible he hears electra
     crying


     int bathroom

     with her head now buried in her arms and knees she is
     sobbing her body rocking  the crying seems very similar
     to jennifers a complete emotional release


     int bedroom

     rath stares at the board  the crying grows louder  he
     stands and walks to the door  he starts to knock but
     stops himself

     like electra with jennifer rath would like to help he
     just has no idea how to  he turns back to the desk to
     his chess game


     int bathroom

     her eyes are now burning red  she stops crying long
     enough to suck down an entire sample of scotch  nikita
     rubs against her and she strokes her

                             electra
               oh shit nikita


     int bedroom

     rath is setting up his computer system  he hears the tub
     filling up


     int bathroom

     nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking

                             electra
               cheers

     electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor
     where we see that many of the bottles are now empty

     in the tub steam rising off the surface she wrings out a
     wash cloth and covers her face sinking deeper into the
     water


     int bedroom

     when electra comes out of the bathroom rath is again at
     his chess game  she sits down across from him and sets
     the gun on the table between them

     rath looks up at her

                             electra
               listen  i dont even know your
               name

                             rath
               rath  robert rath

                             electra
               electra

                             rath
               just electra

                             electra
               yeah

                             rath
               as in daughter of agamemnon

                             electra
               no  just electra

     the conversation dies

                             electra
               what im trying to say is that 
               im not sure i can do this help
               you unless i know more about you

                             rath
               what do you want to know

                             electra
               if bain hadnt taken the contract on
               me would you have

     he stares at her

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               because im done

                             electra
               this is crazy  i cant trust you
               you cant trust me  how can we
               possibly help each other

     they sit in silence the gun and the chess game lying
     between them

                             rath
               do you play

     she looks at the chess board

                             electra
               with computers

                             rath
               its not the same is it

                             electra
               better than playing with yourself

     he smiles

                             rath
               i had an opponent

     she understands that he is trying to tell her something

                             electra
               had

                             rath
               he was russian  nicholai
               tachlinkov  a legend in the
               business when i was just starting
               i admired him  when i heard he
               loved chess i became obsessed with
               the game

     electra studies the board

                             electra
               he was white

     rath nods

                             electra
               it looks like whites game

                             rath
               we played with a code using the new
               york times obituaries  over three
               years we played twelve matches  i
               never won

                             electra
               why didnt you finish this game

     she reaches over and lifts a white knight and takes a
     bishop  rath counters taking her knight

                             rath
               he was taken

                             electra
               he was killed

     rath nods

     throughout the entire conversation they continue to play
     out the chess game

                             electra
               by who

     a long beat

                             rath
               i killed him

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               because thats how it works  thats
               what its about  he was the best
               he was on top

                             electra

               thought so

                             rath

               agency

               washington university  then i
               entered the agency training program

               they

                             electra
               but you knew what they were training
               you for

                             rath
               of course  i was going to be james
               bond

                             electra
               ahhhh

                             rath
               they are very good at what they do
               its very seductive  the training
               the weapons the travel 

                             electra
               the exotic women

                             rath
               women  no not really

                             electra
               why not

                             rath
               women i dont i dont want to
               talk about women

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               because you are a women

                             electra
               why did you leave the agency

                             rath
               the same reason everyone does  you
               hear your name on cspan and you
               realize youre a skeleton in
               someones closet and theyre coming
               to bury you

                             electra
               they tried to kill you

                             rath
               yes  it didnt matter much to them
               as long as i disappeared

                             electra
               then you went freelance

                             rath
               the only thing different about the
               private sector is that a general
               contractor takes less of a
               percentage than the government so
               you make more money  then once you
               make the transition you realize you
               were never working for the
               government it was always the
               private sector the vested interests
               and its the same vested interests
               that continue to buy your plane
               tickets

                             electra
               tell me about the first time

                             rath
               my first take

                             electra
               yes

                             rath
               why

                             electra
               because i want to know

                             rath
               it was mechanical  very precise
               it was exactly like the training
               drill except for the adrenaline

                             electra
               are they usually like that

                             rath
               no  just the first one

                             electra
               after that

                             rath
               they become complicated messy

                             electra
               did it ever bother you

                             rath
               did it ever bother james bond

                             electra
               thats fiction

                             rath
               this is fiction!  dont you see
               that  this is another reality  and
               the people that come into the world
               to play this game  nobody forces
               them!  theyre here they know the
               rules the stakes the risks!  do
               you understand what i am saying  no
               one is innocent  including you!

                             electra
               does that mean it didnt bother you

     rath leans back and stares at her  she waits

                             rath
               you get a job swinging a hammer the
               first day you get a blister it
               tears open it bleeds and it stays
               sore a long time  you keep swinging
               the hammer you get a good hard
               callous that covers that spot and it
               never bothers you again

     electra says nothing  he leans forward and slides a rook
     into her back row

                             rath
               check

     he leans back

                             rath
               is that what you wanted to hear
               something cold blooded something
               remorseless

                             electra
               no  something honest

     a beat  rath likes this woman

     she moves her queen

                             electra
               mate

     he smiles

                             electra
               i hope your plan is better than your
               game


     int cheap hotel  night

     across a table  the hotel phone is in a modem which is
     held together with duct tape  between the modem and the
     computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of
     naked circuit boards

     it is a very similar set up to raths only it has been
     put together with a fraction of the resources

     bain sits typing at the computer his shirt off  beside

               wonder what it was like up here  i
               would always try to peek through the
               curtains

     rath says nothing staring out the window

     electra shakes her head

                             electra

     ext hotel paraiso  day

     the cab pulls up in front of a large brand new glass
     hotel which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the
     gulf water

     rath is upset

                             rath
                       in spanish

               take us there


     ext costa blanca  day

     american tourist dollars have built up the coasts but
     much of the outlying city is very poor

     the old hotel paraiso is a five story blackened husk  the
     face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
     in space as something noncorporeal like the shadow of
     the building rather than the building itself

     rath stares at it remembering

     electra is behind him standing in the midst of the plaza
     del sol

     he looks up to the fifth story window then turns directly
     opposite of that

     the international banco de mexico an enormous beautiful
     old building its exterior walls are whitewashed
     concrete blindingly bright white

     electra looks at the bank and smiles

                             electra
               so thats where all that s & l
               money is

     rath is not listening to her  he is somewhere else  he
     turns back to the fourth story window

                             rath
               thats where hell be

                             electra
               what

                             rath
               i wasnt expecting this  i need to
               think


     ext hotel paraiso  night

     beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to
     midnight oil


     int hotel paraiso elevator

     on one side of the elevator is a young couple who look
     like newlyweds  they are cuddling kissing and giggling
     as though they are alone

     electra and rath are on the other side of the elevator
     it is a strange contrast

     electra is staring at them

     rath behind his sunglasses is in his own world

     the elevator chimes and opens

     nobody moves

     the doors chime again and start to close as everyone
     realizes that this is their floor

     rath and the other man grab the doors which spring back
     open

     it is a funny awkward moment as everyone apologizes and
     smiles politely on the way out


     int hall

     the couple move down the hall the newlyweds finding their
     door first

     rath reaches the door to their room opens it and enters

     electra lingers watching the other couple watching as he
     fumbles for his keys her hand running up between his legs
     and over his ass

     he finally manages to open the door and she pushes him
     inside

     electra softly closes her door


     int hotel paraiso  hotel room

     rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding
     balcony doors at the dark gulf water

                             electra
               did you see them

     electra moves about the large suite

                             electra
               they looked like they were in love

     rath says nothing

                             electra
               well i think ill take a bath
               come on nikita!

     the two of them walk into the bathroom leaving rath to
     himself


     int bathroom

     electra sits on the edge of the oversized tub water
     running through her fingers as she adjusts the
     temperature

     after a beat she hears a small crash a glass breaking
     it is followed by other muffled noises a woman giggling
     and a thumping  the sounds are coming from the other side
     of the tub wall from the other suite  electra puts her
     ear against the tile to listen

     the water filling her tub is too loud for her to hear
     she turns it off

     there is more bumping and thumping the woman laughing and
     then the laughs shorten into soft whimpers

     electra hangs on each sound slowly lifted by it moving
     up toward the overhead fan and ducts

     the sounds get louder as she moves closer to the vents
     until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub
     listening to what is clearly the sounds of two people
     making love

     their moans and shrieks climax and electra smiles


     int bedroom

     it is dark now  a single desk light is on under which
     rath is setting up his chess board putting the pieces in
     their familiar pattern

     electra comes out of the bathroom  she seems very clean
     and fresh wearing a long white tshirt and thin robe

                             electra
               that felt great  you should try it

     she watches him setting the pieces onto the board

                             electra
               dont you ever get tired of playing
               the same game

     he looks at her

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               why not

                             rath
               it helps me to focus  it centers
               me helps me think

                             electra
               oh  what do you think about

                             rath
               work  the things i need to get
               done

     she sits across from him looking at the board

                             electra
               do you think about the game

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               but youve never figured out a way
               to win

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               not even a stalemate

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               what happens if you do

     this strikes rath as a very strange question and he is
     suddenly annoyed by her

                             electra
               can i ask you something

     he knows she will anyway

                             electra
               what will you do if this works if
               we get the money

                             rath
               i dont know maybe ill live on a
               boat sail to all the places ive
               never been

                             electra
               that sounds nice

     he finishes his glass of bourbon

     she is not sure what to say next if she should say
     anything at all

                             electra
               im kind of tired  i think id like
               to try and get some sleep

                             rath
               you can have the bed  the chair is
               fine for me

     he pours himself another drink dropping in some ice from
     the ice bucket

                             electra
               thanks

     she slips out of the robe and in between the sheets

     rath sits across the room his back to her

     she tries to make herself comfortable but cannot

                             electra
               do you think hes here

                             rath

               in costa blanca

                             rath
               yes

     she thinks

                             electra
               what do you think hes doing

                             rath
               i dont know but im sure hes
               not sleeping

     she pulls the covers tightly to her chin  her eyes do not
     close


     int hotel costa blanca  night

     a small hotel in the city away from the beaches built
     before there was such a thing as central air conditioning

     bain is naked except for a small pair of camouflage
     jockeys and his walkman strapped to his shoulder  his
     head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in
     his ears

     he is tearing open a long box wrapped in happy birthday
     paper

     inside the box is a massive black hitech assault rifle
     he smiles

     he assembles it quickly snapping it together with
     automatic ease  when the sight is tightened in place he
     jumps up

     in the mirror over the dresser he poses down with the
     gun

     not satisfied he grabs his shades and checks himself
     again  he starts moving with the music playing with the
     gun first as a guitar then whipping it around spinning
     it expertly like a drum and bugle corpsman  the gun zips
     and flashes around as he whirls in place then freezes

     the butt of the rifle to his shoulder he peers down the
     scope at his own head reflected in the mirror  he is
     sweating and breathing but the barrel does not move

                             bain
               youre dead motherfucker


     ext hotel paraiso  day

     electra leans out over the railing smiling inhaling the
     warm air the scent of the shimmering bluegreen sea

     rath stands in the shadow of the door frame

                             rath
               breakfast

                             electra
               why dont you bring it out here
               its beautiful out here

     rath steps a little farther out  he looks down either
     side of the building checking sight lines  he looks out
     and sees another hotel with windows facing them

     he turns to her  says nothing  moves back inside


     int hotel room

     the breakfast trays are empty  rath is sipping coffee
     scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper

     electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach

     he stops working

                             electra
               i know what you are thinking  im
               not going to disappear okay  im
               not going anywhere just down there
               to that beautiful beach  i got to
               get out of this room just for a
               little while

                             electra
               book  sunglasses  great


     int hotel hall

     electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach
     at the end of the hall she sees the newlywed couple get
     on the elevator  she starts to call to them to hold it
     for her but she stops herself

     the elevator closes

     she edges slowly down the hall stopping outside the door
     to their suite  she touches it with the tips of her
     fingers


     int hotel room  day

     rath is still at the table

     the curtain begins to billow a soft breeze blowing
     through the open patio door  they swell open and fall
     it seems for a moment that there is a figure a shadow in
     the changing shape of the curtain

     rath stands  he walks to the open door  standing in the
     frame he looks out at the blue ocean below

     he slides the door closed and the curtains fall still


     ext plaza del sol  day

     bain moves through the market booths lining the edges of
     the plaza  his eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses

     he buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
     plaza

     he looks at the bank at the militarystyle security
     guards that patrol the front

     he turns in the plaza checking the perimeter his gaze
     falling on the tall burnedout building

     he looks back at the bank imagining the sight line

     he bites into the apricot its juice gushing running down
     his chin


     int hotel room

     rath is leaning back in the bed nikita purring in his
     lap

     he did not sleep last night and is very tired  his eyes
     fight to stay open

     the sound of the television momentarily hangs in the hotel
     room as he sleeps  the program is a spanish dubbed
     version of goldfinger

     the door bangs open and rath springs off the bed a gun
     flashing in his hand leveling it at a dazed blinking
     electra

     rath sighs slowly letting the hammer of the gun click
     back into place

                             rath
               you should knock

                             electra
               sorry

                             rath
               how was the beach

                             electra
               the beach  it was nice

     she smiles


     ext hotel paraiso  dusk

     the sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows
     of the hotel


     int hotel room

     electra is sitting on the bed her back against the wall
     in her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is
     looking over the top of staring intensely across the
     room

     we can hear rath his breathing deep and even  he is
     doing tai chi wearing only his boxer shorts  his body is
     coated in a sheen of sweat his muscles strained as he
     moves fluidly through space

     electra begins to breath with him

     she moves her body slightly her hips rising as though to
     meet his

     he empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops his
     eyes closed rested

                             electra
               that was beautiful

     he looks at her

                             electra
               tai chi right

     he nods

                             electra
               where did you learn it

                             rath

               like youre really good at it

               ive always wanted to learn
               something like that

                             rath
               you should  its very important
               that the body release the energy
               that builds in it

     electra nods watching him bend reaching for a change of
     clothes

                             rath
               im going to shower  if youre
               hungry go ahead and order some
               dinner

     electra nods again


     int costa blanca hotel  night

     bain is doing push ups  he is naked except for his
     camouflage bikinis

     he has his feet up on a chair making it harder the dip
     deeper

     his body is gushing sweat his face a burning red

     he is like a piston firing up and down  the muscles in
     his neck and shoulders are bulging cords

     slowly his arm begin to tire the strain seen in his
     knotting and twisting expression

     half way up he collapses feet falling off the chair

     he rolls onto his back rubbing a tricep  it hurts  he
     licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles


     int hotel paraiso room  night

     rath checks his watch  its after eight oclock  he
     lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem

                             rath

     electra drops her book and climbs off the bed

               goodbye robert

     rath disconnects  the phone hums

     electra picks it up placing it back in the cradle

                             rath
               sit down

     he opens a case and pulls out his gun some paper and pens
     and two small mikes that look like hearing aids

                             rath
               okay 

     he starts drawing several squares on the paper as electra
     picks up the mike  she looks over it frowns

               will begin to doubt himself  he
               will begin to believe that he missed
               me that somehow i slipped by and am
               already on a plane to europe

     he describes this as though remembering it

                             rath

               security system metal detectors and

               ive been thinking about it for a
               long time

                             electra
               except 

                             rath

                             rath
               i was

     she waits for him to explain

                             rath
               ten years ago i sat there in that
               same hotel window sweat pouring off
               of me waiting 

                             electra
               for nicholai

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               you killed him here  in this city
               outside that bank

     rath nods

                             electra
               what is it  i dont like this at
               all  what is going on here

                             rath
               i dont know  it just happened  i
               was here ten years ago im here
               now  thats it

                             electra
               i dont believe that

                             rath
               it wasnt planned or premeditated
               i swear  things happened beyond my
               control  i understood i saw where
               they were leading and i suppose that
               it just made sense

                             electra
               ten years ago

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               what happened

                             rath
               i waited until i was insane and then
               i walked into the bank  he was
               sitting there very calm waiting
               for me

                             electra
               what did he want

                             rath
               he wanted what i want now to get
               out of the business  to disappear
               to some empty greek island

                             rath
               what did he say

                             rath
               he said i couldnt win  that no one
               wins at this game

                             electra
               was that it

                             rath
               then he offered me one million
               dollars to walk away to quit the
               business

                             electra
               you didnt take it

                             rath
               no  i went back to the hotel  and
               waited

                             electra
               ten years later here you are again

                             rath
               yes  here i am again


     pov  through telescopic lens  marble statue

     the crosshairs of a telescopic sight are linedup on the
     head of a marble statue


     int costa blanca hotel  night

     bain is laying on the floor in the dark  the rifle is
     under him as he aims out of his balcony down the street
     at the statue

     he looks up from the scope checking the street  it is
     dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight

     his finger squeezes the gun almost silent as 

     intercut with

     statue

     a chunk of stone explodes out the head of the statue
     again the gun spits and another cloud of dust and rock
     bursts from the head  his finger is pumping the trigger
     until the head cracks and falls

     hes laughing hysterical looking down the street at the
     headless statue

     he rolls onto his side still laughing  then suddenly he
     stops staring up at the stars in the night sky


     int hotel paraiso room  night

     electra is still at the table staring at the diagrams in
     another world

     rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her

                             electra
               this has been the longest day of my
               life

     rath nods pouring himself a drink  electra looks at the
     drink downs the whole glass  he refills it

                             electra
               do you have ulcers

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               i think i got one today

                             rath
               five million dollars will buy a lot
               of rolaids

     she smiles  they both gulp down their drinks and he fills
     them again

                             electra
               what do you suppose hes doing now

     rath shrugs  he is no longer looking at her staring at
     the board moving his mind into the chess game

     she watches him and then begins to study it with him the
     way a child does almost imitating him  she does not want
     to be left alone right now

     she reaches over and moves a white knight

     he blinks  his eyes shifting sorting the possibilities

     he picks a bishop and counters

     after another sequence he takes her bishop and she takes
     his knight

                             rath
               why did you trade a bishop for a
               knight

                             electra
               i hate bishops  theyre useless  i
               like knights

                             rath
               theyre worth less points

                             electra
               so

     there is no point in arguing

     as they continue to play we begin to hear in the
     distance the couple in the adjoining suite making very
     vigorous love

     electra watches rath to see if he hears them  he shows no
     sign of it concentrating on the game

                             electra
               do you hear them

     he looks up

                             electra
               listen

     he hears it  not interested

                             electra
               did you think they were newlyweds

                             rath
               i didnt notice them

                             electra
               when i first saw them i thought they
               were married

                             rath
               how do you know theyre not

                             electra
               i went into their room this
               afternoon

                             rath
               what

                             electra
               it was no big deal  i saw them
               leave i went in

                             rath
               jesus if someone had 

                             electra
               nobody ever sees me   

                             rath
               why in the hell would you take that
               chance

                             electra
               i heard them last night and it made
               me want to know something about
               them  i wanted to so i did

     rath shakes his head  in the bg the woman is almost
     screaming

                             electra
               she is married but not to him
               another man much older  she has
               four kids  the young guy works for
               her  and i think she likes kinky
               sex

                             rath
               thank you

                             electra
               isnt it interesting though  i
               mean look at us in this room  or
               yesterday when we were walking in
               the plaza market  i mean we look
               like just another couple  but what
               are we  doesnt it seem so crazy

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               no

                             rath
               its always been that way  the
               world has always functioned on two
               levels

                             electra
               i know  it makes me crazy

                             rath
               why

                             electra
               i dont know  when i was in
               college i was forced to go to a
               psychiatrist because i was caught
               drilling holes in my dorm room
               floor

                             rath
               and you were drilling these
               holes

                             electra
               so i could watch the girl that lived
               under me

                             rath
               apparently this doctor was unable to
               cure you

                             electra
               he told me that my curiosity became
               unnaturally entangled with my sense
               of selfpreservation

                             rath
               did he explain how this happened

                             electra
               he believed it all went back to one
               night when as a little girl  i
               watched my parents have this big
               fight really big  i thought my
               mother was going to kill my father
               then they went into their room and
               made up  and i watched them make
               love through the keyhole

     the woman screams a final time in climax

     electra moves her queen taking his other knight

                             rath
               what are you doing

                             electra
               what

                             rath
               thats a ridiculous move

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               because ill take it

                             electra
               im playing white remember  you
               cant tell me which pieces to move
               it doesnt work that way

     he shrugs and takes her queen the game continuing

                             electra
               can i ask you something

                             rath
               im sure you will

               am i attractive

     this gets his attention

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               are you attracted to me

                             rath
               yes

                             electra
               why

                             rath
               why  i dont know

                             electra
               is it a physical thing or a mental
               thing

                             rath
               both

     a good answer  electra smiles

                             electra
               is that why you didnt want to talk

               attraction is a complication

                             rath

                             electra
               was she the only one

                             rath
               after her i realized that to
               survive i had to live without
               its dangerous to let things become
               complicated

                             electra
               is this becoming complicated

                             rath
               im not sure that i care anymore

     he looks up from the game

                             electra
               were you attracted to me right away

                             rath
               no

                             electra
               when did it start

                             rath
               honestly

                             electra
               uhhuh

                             rath
               when i gave you my gun and you
               almost shot me

                             electra
               maybe you should see a psychiatrist

                             rath
               why

                             electra
               that doesnt sound normal

                             rath
               im not normal

                             electra
               i know  thats why im attracted to
               you  i mean you make me nervous
               youre intimidating  maybe its my
               curiosity/selfpreservation thing
               but all i can really think about
               right now is kissing you

     they rise up from the table together knocking over the
     chess game  the pieces fall to the floor

     they grab at each other kissing both of them hungry
     aggressive  they tear at each others clothes and at
     their own clothes it has a very awkward sense to it as
     they become naked in front of each other  there is
     nothing smooth or fluid about it which makes it seem very
     real

     he takes her lifting her onto the table

     she scoots and wiggles back the chess pieces falling out
     of the way

     she opens her legs and he moves in between them

                             electra
               i wanted to tell you 

     her breath rushes out then back in

                             electra
               my real name is anna

     he smiles

                             electra
               martin

     her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into
     her

                             electra
               nice to meet you martin

     ext costa blanca  night

     we are moving down the street low over the old
     flagstones towards the marble statue that bain shot

     on the ground are the shattered pieces of the head

     closer

     we see one of the pieces is part of the face the eyes
     which seem like the irisless eyes of a chess king

     closer

     we move into the blank white of that eye

                                                 dissolve to

     white square glossed with light

     we pull back rising up and away and see other squares
     black and white like a chess board

     a womans high heels click past

     rising higher we see the woman walking  a man crosses
     behind her in another direction

     higher still and we realize that we are looking at the
     black and white marble floor of the 


     int international banco de mexico  day

     it is a strange and beautiful bank

     the ceilings are vast the suspended lights elaborate
     baroque the enormous clock on the wall built to resemble
     a sun

     it looks almost as though it could be a museum with its
     massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important
     mexican figures

     already it is crowded people and security guards moving
     about beneath us

     rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers

     electra looks up over her book and bain is there moving
     down the side street gliding through the crowd with the
     menacing indifference of a shark

     the official is talking to the teller in spanish when
     electra whispers in raths ear

     rath freezes

     electra watches as bain moves along the plywood wall
     covered with bills and posters built to keep people out
     of the burned hotel  he is carrying a long nylon duffel
     bag

     at the corner a section of the plywood has been pulled
     loose and bain squeezes through into the hotel

                             electra
               hes inside


     int bank

     rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs
     set in pairs along the wall of the bank

     he glances at the enormous clock which reads 1010  he
     checks his rolex

                             rath
               now we wait


     int burned hotel paraiso

     the center of the hotel is open  interior hall balconies
     which line each floor look down onto an old atrium
     courtyard  the fire did the most damage here spreading
     easily throughout the entire building

     the skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area has
     been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing
     broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened
     floors and walls

     bain enters and carefully begins climbing the charred
     staircase to the fifth floor


     int burned hotel room

     the room has been heavily burned stained black from
     smoke  the charred carpet crunches and cracks as bain
     walks across it to the window

     as he nears the exterior wall several floor boards break
     with a brittle snap and he almost falls through

                             bain
               shit

     he pulls his leg free

     outside the window across the plaza he sees the bank a
     perfect site

     quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun

     he grabs a magazine and snaps it into place

     he aims down at the banks bright white stairs  a man is
     walking down the steps and bain finds the center of his
     forehead in the crosshairs of the scope

     bain makes a gun noise followed by the sound of a head
     bursting open

     he giggles

     leaning against the wall in the shadows of the window
     the gun in his lap he waits

     time slows to a crawl

     without taking his eye from the bank bain rummages
     through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes  he pulls
     one out with his lips and lights it

     taking a deep drag he lets the smoke slowly leak out and
     drift up into the night

                                                 dissolve to

     sun

     white hot


     int burned hotel room

     there are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened
     window sill where bain extinguishes another

                             bain
               what in the fuck are you doing in
               there

     the room is hot a streak of sweat up his back and front
     it is difficult to breathe

     a man walks out of the bank wearing a suit similar to
     raths  bains body snaps erect rifle instantly leveled

     he sights the mans head his finger tightening on the
     trigger but he is not sure it is rath

     he looks over the scope looks back  the man reaches the
     bottom of the stairs  bains body sags

                             bain
               thats not him  jesus bain baby
               chill the fuck out

     he takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his
     forehead leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood

     he again fumbles through his bag finding a container of
     bottled water  he chugs the whole thing


     int bank

     the official walks over to rath with a number of papers to
     sign

                             official
               your signature senor  everything
               is ready

     teeth  he has to urinate  bad

     he is checking every face that comes out of the bank with
     the scope  still nothing

                             bain
               this is fucking insane

     he grabs the empty plastic bottle unzips his pants and
     begins refilling it

     a man in a suit appears on the steps and bain fumbles the
     bottle spilling it as he lifts the gun  it is not rath

                             bain
               fucking god dammit!

     bain sits at the window his body a knot

     a large group of tourists flow out of the bank and bains
     eyes light up  one by one the scope passes over each
     face

     they trickle down the steps and into the plaza

     the stairs are again empty

     bain screams pounding the butt of the gun down splitting
     open the floor

     he looks at the bank  nothing  he checks his watch  in
     fifteen minutes the bank will close

     he stands up

     she sees bain storming up the stairs  she stands tosses
     several bills on the table and leaves

     bain charges into the bank tearing off his sunglasses
     scanning the room  his face is a twisted grimace
     streaked with black charcoal  his body and clothes are
     covered in sweat and large salt rings  his breathing
     labored

     he sees rath sitting comfortably calm his suit not even
     wrinkled and realizes that rath has been waiting for him

     his first instinct is to turn and run but he stops
     himself  he is confused unsure

     then as though understanding he has no choice he puts
     his sunglasses back on and strides over to rath boots
     clicking against the polished marble

     bain sits down in the leather chair across from him

                             bain
               howd you know  just tell me that

               the real irony is that you wont

               thing that went through your head
               was that you were a dead man

               dont trust anyone  its automatic
               its the first and last commandment
               its the only thing that keeps you

     int burned hotel room

     duffel bag

     digging through it she finds his gameboy his walkman
     his 22 ammunition clips and several issues of soldier of
     fortune and a punisher comic book

     int burned hotel

     and has started looking in other rooms

               is that in just a few minutes im

     bain jumps out of the seat

                             bain
               yeah okay!  im ready!  lets
               fucking go!

     hes walking turning watching everything everyone
     hes out the door


     int burned hotel

     electra is on the fourth level searching desperately for
     the gun rushing through the black skeletal remains of the
     hotel

     in her ear she hears rath

                             rath vo
               electra

     she shrieks


     int bank

     rath is at the counter as the official loads perfectly
     stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the
     case

                             rath
               electra

     electra is frantic

                             electra
               god i cant find it!  i cant find
               it!  i cant find the fucking gun!


     int bank

     for rath everything has changed


     ext plaza

     in long pounding strides bain crosses the square
     twisting glancing back watching


     int burned hotel

     electra nears the room below the fifth story window

                             electra
               it wasnt with his other stuff!


     int bank

     rath is now afraid

                             rath
               electra get out


     ext side street

     bain nears the opening in the plywood wall


     int burned hotel

     electra looks up and there is the gun supported by black
     plumbing pipe and charred lathe  it hangs in the space
     between two joists hidden in the upstairs floor

                             rath vo
               hes coming electra!  get out now!

                             electra
               oh god  i see it!

     she reaches for it but its too high

                             rath vo
               electra listen!  you have got to
               come to the bank for the money!  the
               money!

     she is not listening she is rushing down the hall back
     toward the stairs

     just as she grabs the rail she hears bain storming into
     the lobby below

     she begins climbing the stairs quickly but quietly

     bain is a rampaging beast lunging up the stairs


     int bank

     the bank is almost empty  rath has begun to sweat

                             rath
               electra!

     the official looks at him strangely stacking the last of
     the green paper blocks


     int burned hotel

     electra peeks over the rail to see bain right behind her

                             rath vo
               electra!

     the voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off
     stuffing it in her pocket


     int bank

                             rath
               electra whats happening  what are
               you 

     the official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut

                             official
               finido senor


     int burned hotel

     electra turns into the hotel room just as bain reaches the
     fifth floor  there is no time
     
     she slips into the closet as bain whips around the corner
     into the room  he rushes to the window slamming himself
     against it

                             bain
               youre gonna take me  come on!
               come on motherfucker!

     he bends down and from the hole that he fell into pulls
     out the assault rifle

                             bain
               take this!  take this you fuck!

     electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood
     lathe

     he pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through
     the wall

                             bain
               motherfucker!

     he stands suddenly perfectly still gun aimed at the
     bank

                             bain

     int bank

     the sun clock reads six oclock

     there is no one left in the bank except for employees and
     guards

     the official is at raths elbow leading him towards the
     metal gates

                             official
               we are closed senor  thank you for
               banking with us

     it is happening as it happened ten years ago  rath knows
     that he is unable to stop it


     int burned hotel

     bain is rigid cast in iron the rifle rammed under his
     chin sight tight to his eye finger wrapped around the
     trigger

     electra silently ever so delicately opens her bag
     lifting out her gun

                             bain
               make me shit you sorry ass piece of
               mark meat!  come on come on  its
               over!  i know it!  you know it!  we
               know it!

     in the


     telescopic sight

     we watch rath step out of the bank the doors closing
     behind him


     back to scene

     bain smiles


     inside closet

     electra slowly rises still watching bain


     ext plaza

     the sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep
     orange and auburn cast

     rath looks down at the descending white stone steps

     he steps down to the first stair


     int burned hotel

                             bain
               lift your head motherfucker

     electra is standing  the gun clenched in her shaking
     hand

                             bain
               look up here


     telescopic sight

     the crosshairs are an x on raths head


     back to scene

                             bain
               look up  look at me  i want to see
               your face


     ext plaza

     rath looks across the square up the side of the hotel at
     the window there is only black shadow

     he knows it is over


     int burned hotel

                             bain
               yes

     electra shoves open the door leveling the gun 

     as bain turns

                             bain
               wha 

     she fires

     his shoulder explodes blood spraying the black wall


     ext plaza

     rath hears bain scream

                             rath
               electra

     his eyes his whole body comes to life


     int burned hotel

     bain is twisting in midair diving as 

     she fires again moving at him  a chunk of wood explodes
     as she misses

     he falls the burned floor shattering charred joists
     shearing with the sound of breaking glass

     she watches him fall through hears him hit the floor
     below ash and wood clattering around him

     the gun trained on the hole she peers over the edge but
     he is gone


     ext plaza

     rath races wildly across the darkening market square


     int burned hotel

     bain lying on his back aims the rifle at her footsteps

                             bain
               die bitch!

     he fires finger pumping bullets erupting through the
     floor around her feet

     screaming she leaps out of the room into the hall

     his shoulders oozing blood bain clenches his teeth and
     rises listening as 

     she sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall

     beneath he moves to the railing and aims at the
     staircase waiting until 

     electra freezes at the top of the stairs realizing that
     they are exposed

     she flashes her head quickly dipping back as the wall is
     perforated with bullets

                             bain
               fuck!  god damn bitch!  what are you
               doing  i dont believe this is
               happening!

     she can hear him coming his voice echoing through the
     hollow building  she looks down the stairs the hall
     above there is nowhere to go

                             bain
               youre dead!  youre fucking dead!
               im going to kill you a hundred
               fucking times for this!

     bain fires up at the ceiling the bullet tearing through
     the floor whizzing past electras head  if she moves
     hell know her position

     he fires another

     electra sinks down her back against the wall and aims at
     the floor

     another shot

     she fires back

     bain closes as they both start firing silenced weapons
     flashing pumping lead at unseen targets

     her gun empties first

     he laughs hearing the click

                             bain
               game over bitch!

                             rath
               bain!

     raths scream echoes up through the building

     before bain can target him rath is gone a shadow a
     ghost  he scans the hotels courtyard  the last light
     from the setting sun slips through the slits cracks and
     broken window panes casting patterns a surreal dream
     like grid resembling a chess board

     electra sees her chance  she leaps to her feet throwing
     the gun over the balcony

     the two men watch the gun clatter to the floor as she
     races back to the room

                             bain
               fuck no!

     rath grabs the gun tracking bain hurling up the stairs to
     the fifth floor  rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
     is empty

                             rath
               shit!

     bain reaches the top of the stairs before electra gets to
     the end of the hall

     rath sees it all happening

                             rath
               electra!

     bain snaps into a targeting stance

     electra is flying toward the door her feet hardly
     touching the floor 


     telescopic sight

     when the crosshairs find her back


     back to scene

                             rath
               electra!

     time becomes syrup

                             rath
               down!  get down!

     bain fires

     electra dives

     the blackened door jamb splinterbursts in front of her

     she bounces scrambling on all fours into the room

     bain hurries down the hall after her as rath bolts for the
     stairs

     seeing rath exposed on the stairs bain whips around and
     fires the wall shredding behind rath as he dives back
     down into the shadows

     ripping open bains duffel bag electra grabs bains 22

     bain advances steadily the rifle trained on the door

     inside the room electra grunts hurling the duffel bag out
     the door  it spins over the balcony and plummets to the
     ground and bursts open

     a gun clip skitters across the stone tile coming to rest
     in the middle of the courtyard

     rath and bain both see it

     staying hidden rath immediately circles towards it

     bain sweats looking at the door down at the clip then
     back at the door  somethings got to give

     unsure what to do electra waits the gun clenched between
     her two hands covering the empty dark space of the door

     bain makes his choice moving towards room 502

     rath sees that bain is going after electra  he takes a
     slow breath and tears from the shadows 

     bolting into the open rath is focused wholly on the clip
     the ground a blur beneath him 

     bain reacts the rifle swings rushing arcing after rath

     two more steps and rath dives sliding snagging the clip
     as 

     the rifle spits 

     rath screams his leg erupting with blood


     telescopic sight

     the scope glides up zeroing the back of raths head


     back to scene

     rath rams the clip in place

                             bain
               game 

     bain squeezes the trigger 

     click  the rifle is empty  bain screams in disbelief

     rolling over rath jacks back the slide and sights the
     balcony but bain is gone

     electra searches the room for a way out  keeping the gun
     trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole
     that bain fell through

     grimacing rath struggles to his feet

                             rath
               electra!

     bain explodes through the wall charred wood and plaster
     flying

     electra spins to shoot but the floor suddenly cracks open
     swallowing her

     limping lurching up the stairs rath hears the crash

     jarred by the fall electra drags herself away from the
     open ceiling

                             rath
               the gun!  he needs the gun!  get rid
               of it!  throw it!

     she looks up for bain but he has again disappeared  she
     looks at the gun thinking turning it over in her hands

     his leg soaked with blood rath rumbles down the hall

     black with soot bain descends soundless serpentlike to
     the fourth level through another burned opening

     electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound at
     every dark corner  she is almost there when we see bain
     a shadow coming to life emerging behind her

     lumbering rath is halfway there his eyes riveted on the
     door to room 502

     hearing bain electra turns  in one smooth motion he
     snatches her arm and breaks her wrist  the gun falls

     rath hears her scream

     electra kicks at his groin but he drops leg sweeping her
     to the ground

     she gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face
     jackknifing her body back knocking her unconscious

     bain grabs the gun

     rath whips into the room blasting 

     bullets chasing bain as he disappears into a blackened
     hole

     rath goes to electra not knowing if she is alive or dead
     gently he turns her cradling her head her face smeared
     with blood

     from within the labyrinth rath hears bain begin to laugh

                             bain os
               hey!  tell me something bobbyboy

     electra comes to her eyes blinking open

                             bain os
               are you still thinking that youre
               going to take me

     electra is trying to focus as rath listens to the voice
     searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from
     everywhere

                             bain os
               no i dont think you are  you know
               what i think

     the voice is closer  rath wipes the stinging sweat from
     his eyes

                             bain os
               i think youre thinking what im
               thinking

     still dizzy electra taps her fist against raths chest

                             bain os
               you know what im thinking
               bobbyboy!

     it seems as though bain is in the room

                             bain os
               you know what im thinking!

     electra opens her fist and inside rath sees the handful of
     bullets from the other gun

     bain whirls into view his gun whipping around to rath who
     turns too slow

     bain pumps the trigger  one click  another  and
     another  the gun is empty

                             rath
               yeah i know what youre thinking

     he levels his gun

                             rath
               game over

     rath fires over and over emptying the gun into bains
     head and chest even as he crashes through the balcony
     railing and falls twisting through lightless space
     slamming to the stone floor dead


     ext plaza del sol  night

     the sun is gone the market is closing the crowd drifting
     from the plaza

     a man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
     beside the boarded hotel  although they walk a bit slow
     leaning on one another they become it seems like just
     another couple arm in arm holding tightly to each other
     and to a very large suitcase

                                                 fade out

                              the end
