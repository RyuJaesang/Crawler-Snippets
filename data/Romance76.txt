as the last credit appears the song ends in a crescendo and
the screen fades to total black

immediately a new melody begins an uptempo jazz number as
a title appears on the screen

                  god shes beautiful

                                            cut to

int hannahs apartment  night

a full face of lee wearing a gray sweater and leaning
against the dining room doorway  she gazes into the camera
with a halfsmile on her face as elliot speaks over the
screen

                         elliot vo
            god shes beautiful

lee glances over her shoulder then turns from the doorway
and walks away  the camera follows her moving across a
bookandphotographfilled bookshelf that obscures her from
view as she walks into a crowded comfortable vestibule
people some holding drinks some just entering the
apartment surround her  everyone is talking at once
carrying on easy familiar conversation

                         elliot vo
            shes got the prettiest eyes and
            she looks so sexy in that sweater

lee smiles at the various people exchanging greetings

                         lee
            hi how are you

two more guests enter the apartment the vestibule is full
now  still walking lee lightly hugs one of the children as
she continues on her way towards the living room  elliots
voice as well as the jazzy music is heard

                         elliot vo
            i just want to be alone with her
            and hold her and kiss her

lee walks into the living room turning her head back for a
moment to talk to the child she has just hugged

                         elliot vo
            and tell her how much i love her
            and take care of her  stop it you
            idiot  shes your wifes sister
            but i cant help it

the camera is still moving with lee as she smiles and stops
to chat with her mother  elliots voice as well as the
music continues over the low din of warm conversation

                         elliot vo
            im consumed by her  its been
            months now  i dream about her  i
            i i think about her at the office
            oh lee
                   sighing
            what am i gonna do

lee starts to walk off again finishing her conversation
with her mother  she passes several other guests then
turns to greet april giving her a warm brief hug

                         elliot vo
            i hear myself mooning over you and
            its disgusting  before when she

elliots voiceover continues as he is actually seen
standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing
rotund man  both are holding drinks as lee carrying a tray
of hors doeuvres and two drinks walks between them  the
space is very tight the men hold up their drinks to make
room for her

                         elliot vo
            squeezed past me in the doorway
            and i smelled that perfume on the
            back of her neck

elliot watches lee walk off the other man oblivious
continues to talk  elliot reluctantly returns to the
conversation but he cant help turning his head to gaze at
the offscreen lee as the other man chatters on

                         elliot vo
            jesus i i thought i was gonna
            swoon!  easy

the camera resumes following a smiling lee  she has just
put down the tray and drinks near april and briskly and
obliviously she walks past a doorway where elliot still
ruminating watches her entranced

                         elliot vo
            youre a dignified financial
            advisor  it doesnt look good for
            you to swoon

the camera stays with elliot who is still watching the
offscreen lee  in the background guests continue to
chatter warmly with each other

hannah carrying a tray of hors doeuvres walks up behind
the distracted elliot

                         hannah
                   nibbling on an hors doeuvre
            elliot  elliot
                   rubbing his shoulder
            sweetheart

elliot returns from his reveries with a start

                         elliot
                   turning to hannah
            mmhm

                         hannah
                   pointing to the tray
            have you tried these  these are
            wonderful
                   nibbling swallowing
            holly and her friend made them

elliot taking one of the hors doeuvres starts nibbling as
well as he and hannah walk past the bookshelf into the
living room

                         elliot
                   swallowing

elliot and hannah eating and talking walk past a hallway
and offscreen as holly appears walking down the hallway

at the entrance to the hallway eating and looking at the
offscreen guests

                         hannah

holly standing in the hallway onscreen swallows loudly

                         elliot
                   offscreen
                   overlapping holly
            holly why dont you open your own
            restaurant

                         holly
                   turning to the
                   offscreen elliot and
                   hannah trying to swallow

            few private parties

                         elliot

                   agreeing

                         holly
                   swallowing and nodding

                   calling after them

int hannahs kitchen  night

hannah licking her fingers walks past a memocluttered
refrigerator to the stove as holly behind her begins to
speak  the faint sounds of music are still heard

                         holly

as holly talks sipping her drink hannah busily works in
the kitchen which contains a large center table stacked
with bowls and plates of food hanging pots and pans and
general party clutter  she walks onandoffscreen as she
talks and listens to her sister

                         hannah

hannah whod been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby
counter hesitates momentarily  she turns to holly

                         hannah
                   trying to nod her
                   head casually

                         holly
                   turning to face hannah
            you admit that were great cooks
            right

                         hannah
                   nodding back at the
                   stove now stirring
                   in a pot
            yeah

            got some requests to do a few
            dinner parties

food on a different stove  holly turns to face her  only
holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen hannah the
camera moving in closer on her face  as holly speaks she
distractedly nibbles an hors doeuvre  in the background
her parents can be heard singing in the living room

                         holly

            done drugs on a year

holly pops another hors doeuvre into her mouth as the
background singing gets louder and the film cuts to

comfortably on chairs near the piano where evan hannahs
father plays bewitched as hannahs mother norma sits
nearby accompanying him in their duet  a child is sprawled
out under a blanket on a sofa some guests chatter quietly
others drink and eat listening

                         evan & norma
                   singing

comfortably and easily with each other

enthusiastically singing along looking at evan and moving
her hands

hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of
the table past a gleeful holly who points her finger at
hannah as she passes  hannah still laughing playfully
pushes the accusing finger away

                         april
                   laughing with the

                         april
                   nodding and looking
                   at hannah

            no really we mustnt get
            discouraged

as holly continues to tease her sister hannah opens a
drawer in the cabinet  she takes out two apples decorated
with paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to april

                         holly
                   fussing at the table
            hannah will invite some men over
            who dont look like ichabod crane

                         april
                   overlapping

april starts to put the turkey apples on the table  a
bemused hannah takes two more out of the cabinet and places
one of them on the table as well

                         holly
                   straightening a

                   set down her apples
            here  be careful with those

                         holly
                   continuing her

            maybe at christmas new years  if
            not this new years maybe next new
            years

while holly is talking hannah hands her the last turkey
apple accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks
that keeps the decorations in place

                         holly
                   reacting

                         hannah
                   turning to her

in the background elliot is seen walking inside the
bathroom looking around the room  light piano music is
dimly heard

                         elliot

towards the camera

                         lee

elliot walks into the bedroom as lee continues to talk
offscreen  the camera leaving elliot moves across the
room past a wall of framed paintings a headboard and bed
a night table and lamp revealing lee she is flipping
through a book by a curtained window

                         lee

lee puts the book shes been holding down on the desk only
to pick up another one  she looks at the offscreen elliot

                         lee
            well you cant tell its me
            although

him now as he walks across the room

                         elliot

as elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf grabbing a bottle
of antihistamines the camera moves back to lee who sits
down on the bed  she is still holding a book

while mickey answers him offscreen dr abel turns and walks
toward him  the camera follows the doctors movements from
the other side of the wall obscuring him briefly

it moves across a dark examiningroom wall to a second
doorway where mickey sits on a stool continuing to talk to
the offscreen dr abel

dr abel chuckles

                         mickey
                   nodding and gesturing
            now i cacant remember

                         dr abel
            lets take a look

an uptempo bigband sound is heard as the movie cuts to
mickeys examination beginning with a closeup of dr abel
using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous mickey
next is a hearing test  the film shows the doctorss hands
turning the dials on a sonometer  mickey sits on a nearby
high stool large earphones on his head  he listens with
such concentration that he squints his eyes  he holds up a
finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset
finally the film shows dr abel hitting a large turning
fork with his finger  he puts the vibrating fork to mickeys
ear  mickey looking up at the offscreen doctors face nods

the music stops as the film cuts back to dr abels
consultation room  dr abel walks from the examining room
through the consultation room to a second examining room
across the way  he talks to the offscreen mickey as he walks

                         dr abel
            well im sorry to say you have had
            a significant drop in the high
            decibel range of your right ear

                         mickey
                   offscreen
            really!

dr abel moves offscreen in the second examining room  the
camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the
doctor and mickey talk offscreen

                         dr abel
                   offscreen
            have you been exposed to a loud
            noise recently or did you have a
            virus

                         mickey
                   offscreen
            no iive been perfectly healthy
            you know me

dr abel briefly passes by the doorway

                         mickey
                   offscreen
            i always ii always imagine that i
            have things

                         dr abel
                   offscreen
            when did you first notice this

                         mickey
                   offscreen
            oh uh about a month ago  wha
            what do i have

looking preoccupied dr abel walks back into the
consultation room holding mickeys open file  he strides
over to his desk revealing a frightened mickey sitting in
a chair opposite it  still standing the doctor leans over
the desk his back to the camera and makes a few notes in
the file

                         dr abel
            youve had some dizzy spells
                   sighing
            what about ringing and buzzing
            have you uh noticed any of that

                         mickey
                   gesturing
            yes nownow that you mention it
            uh iii have uh buzzing and
            also ringing  ringing and buzzing
            um am i going deaf or something

                         dr abel
                   making more notes in
                   the file
            and its just in one ear

                         mickey
                   picking at his fingers
            yes is it is it uh healthier to
            have problems in both ears

dr abel chuckles as he closes mickeys file and straightens
up  the camera looks past his back and shoulders to the
anxious mickey

                         dr abel
                   his face offscreen
            what id like to do is to make an
            appointment for you at the hospital
            id like to have them run some tests

                         mickey
            the hospital  what kind of tests

dr abel lays his pen across mickeys closed file  he walks
around his desk and sits on its edge close to mickey

                         dr abel
                   sighing
            now dont get alarmed  these are
            just more sophisticated audiometry
            tests than i can run here

                         dr abel

            mmm  thanks

holly laughs lightly as she walks away from the woman
holding her tray she passes a large oval loft window and
several clusters of brunch guests  they are eating and
drinking  no one pays any attention to her

                         holly
                   to two male guests
                   in her way
            excuse me

one of the men murmuring his thanks takes a last shrimp
puff as holly passes

                         holly
                   to the man
            thank you

holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen
her tray is empty

                         april
                   offscreen
            the stroganoff is ready

holly excited runs over to april who is busy taking the
stroganoff out of the oven  she wears the same uniform as
holly black skirt white shirt and black bowtie

april holding the stroganoff dashes out of the kitchen to
serve the party guests  holly calls after her offscreen
as david walks past the hurrying april into the kitchen

                         holly
                   offscreen

                         holly
                   gesturing at some

                   shaking his head
            oh no  not at all

as holly carries the quiche outside to the party april
comes back into the kitchen from another doorway  music as
well as the chatter of mingling guests is heard in the
background

                         april
            we need more bread and some baked
            lasa

                         david
            and the quail is responsible for
            the quail eggs

                         april
                   turning to david and chuckling
            well lets hope so

holly enters the kitchen holding out a plate of clams  she
walks over to david

                         holly
                   looking busily
                   around the room

picks up a napkin from the crowded table

                         david

            bored stiff by the party

                         holly

                   wiping her hands
            what makes you think were more
            interesting

david walks around the table putting the plate of clams
down on the already crowded surface  holly follows him
chuckling throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can
as david stops at a small television set near the doorway
guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in
clusters

                         david
                   turning on the set
            actually im going to listen to
            aida if im not getting in your way

canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter is heard from the
television set  david watches the set still munching on a
clam while holly and april reassure him offscreen

                         april
                   offscreen

david checks his wristwatch as holly walks over to him

                         holly
                   gesturing fiddling
                   with another napkin

holly chuckles as david listening to april impressed
walks over to her  she is standing by the table

                         david
                   nodding to april

april chuckles as holly walks back onscreen she is busy
preparing another tray of hors doeuvres

                         holly
                   gesturing
            oh what what do you do

the three exchange glances  holly shrugs

                                            cut to

ext manhattan street  day

a contemporary red building designed by david is seen
squeezed in between two older buildings  holly april and
david talk offscreen

                         holly
                   offscreen
            wow its the red one

the film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio
sitting in davids jaguar across the street  david and
april sit in the front seat holly sits scrunched up in
back her head slightly forward

                         david
                   gesturing looking
                   back and forth from
                   the buildings to
                   holly and april
            the designs deliberately
            noncontextural  but i wanted to
            keep the atmosphere of the street
            you know and the proportions

                         holly
                   nodding
            uhhuh

                         david
            and in the material
            thatsthats unpolished red
            granite
                   pausing as he
                   watches holly and

                         holly

                         april

                         april

                   turning to april emphatically
            you know april people pass by
            vital structures in this city all

            time to appreciate them  i get the
            feeling you tune in to your
            environment

                         april

            oh

                         holly
                   interrupting
                   gesturing and nodding
            oh its really important

david turns and briefly glances at holly he then turns back
to april

                         april
                   looking only at david
            what are your favorite buildings

                         april
                   looking at david
            great

david starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding
visual excursion through new york citys landmark buildings
as seen from the trios point of view in the moving jaguar
inspiring classical music plays in the background

the series of shots includes the dakota complete with
surrounding winter trees the graybar building on lexington
avenue an incredibly ornate building on seventh avenue and
fiftyeighth street a redstone church an old building
with embellished bulging windows on west fortyfourth
street the art deco chrysler building a redbrick building
abigail adamss old stone house and the pomander walk
nestled off broadway on the upper west side  the group can
be seen walking down the path between the oldfashioned row
houses and shrubbery  a lamppost sits in the foreground

it is now dark  the music continues to play as the film
cuts to the façade of a rococostyle building complete with
french doors and ornate windows  the admiring group is
heard offscreen

                         holly
                   offscreen
            oh its just so romantic  i just
            want to put on a long gown

                         david
                   offscreen overlapping
            yes

                         holly
                   offscreen continuing
            and open the french doors and go
            on the balcony 

                         april
                   offscreen interrupting
            its french though  it really is

                         holly
                   offscreen
            yeah

                         april
                   offscreen overlapping
            it feels like youre in france

                         david
                   offscreen overlapping
            itit is  its romantic

the music stops  the screen which has been exploring the
rococo buildings façade now shows the equally elegant
building alongside it

                         david
                   offscreen
            and its got a handsome partner
            sitting right beside it

                         holly
                   offscreen
            yeah

                         david
                   offscreen overlapping
            they fit right in together  and
            your eye goes along lulled into
            complacency and then

the film moves from the two elegant façade to show an ugly
ultramodern structure covered with tiny diamondshaped
motifs

                         april
                   offscreen
            thats just 

                         david

                         holly
                   offscreen
            thats disgusting!

                         april
                   offscreen continuing
            a monstrosity!  who would do that

                         holly
                   offscreen overlapping
            its really terrible

                         david
                   offscreen emphatically
            its really sad

                         holly
                   offscreen
            and it ruins everything else

                         david
                   offscreen agreeing

waiting for their decision

                   overlapping nodding
            great

they get into the car  once again hollys in the backseat
the classical music begins anew

the movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a
manhattan avenue as seen from the moving jaguar  it then
moves to a closeup of holly sitting in the backseat her
head near the window  she is staring straight ahead

                         holly vo
            naturally i get taken home first
            well obviously he prefers april
            of course i was so tonguetied all
            night  i cant believe i said that
            about the guggenheim  my stupid
            little rollerskating joke  i
            should never tell jokes  mom can
            tell em and hannah but i kill em
                   glaring at the
                   offscreen aprils back
            where did april come up with that
            stuff about adolph loos and terms
            like organic form
                   looking out the side
                   window pausing for a moment
            well naturally  she went to
            brandeis

the movie cuts to hollys point of view the front seat
where david and april sit the jaguars windshield and the
passing lights and traffic of the street  holly continues
her ruminations as april leans over to say something to david

                         holly vo
            but i dont think she knows what
            shes talking about  could you
            believe the way she was calling him
            david yes david  i feel that
            way too david  what a marvelous
            space david
                   emphatically
            i hate april  shes pushy

the film moves back to holly in the backseat still lost in
thought

                         holly vo
            now theyll dump me and shell
            invite him up  i blew it
                   sighing looking out
                   the side window
            and i really like him a lot  oh

            upset  ive got reading to do
            tonight  you know maybe ill get
            into bed early  ill turn to a
            movie and take an extra seconal

the classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins  the
screen cuts to black and a title appears

    nobody not even the rain has such small hands

                                            cut to

ext street outside fredericks loft  day

the movie briefly holds on a ripped red paintsplattered
door as elliot wearing a raincoat appears nearby  he
looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of
view fredericks loft building

the movie goes back to the impatient elliot hes looking
around him  he glances at his watch as the film cuts back
once again to the loft building where lee finally appears
walking down the street away from elliot  a truck passes
down the street  lee doesnt see him  she walks further
and further away she turns a corner

elliot frantically looks around again then in a burst of
decision he runs around a garbage dump crossing the
street and still running he moves down an adjacent street
past the canal lumber company and several other buildings
as the film cuts back to lee walking down a different
street oblivious

the jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between
the fastmoving elliot rushing down the soho streets past
a truck waiting for a light to change past some pedestrians
some garbage cans turning corners and the strolling lee
walking up different streets past different buildings

lee eventually crosses a street lost in thought looking
right and left as elliot pretending nonchalance waits on
the corner looking at his watch  she looks up in surprise
the music stops

                         elliot
                   trying not to sound
                   out of breath
            oh my goodness!

                         lee
                   overlapping smiling
                   in surprise
            oh elliot!

                         elliot
            hi

                         elliot

                   gesturing laughing

            childhood
                   stopping in her

of the pageant book & print shop an old serious bookstore
a nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf
like bookcases which are packed row after row with books

camera moves down an aisle past the rows of books  a piano
playing bewitched is heard  pictures hang on the aisle

int fredericks loft bedroom  night

lee in slacks and shirt is curled up on the bed her back
to the camera as she reads the ee cummings poem in the
glow of a nighttable lamp  the piano music is still heard

                         lee vo
                   reading
            your slightest look easily will
            unclose me
            though i have closed myself as
            fingers
            you open always petal by petal
            myself

as lee continues to read aloud the movie cuts to elliots
darkened den lit by a light in the hallway  elliot enters
wearing a robe crossing the room in the dark

                         lee vo
                   continuing reading
            as spring opens
            [touching skillfully mysteriously]
            her first rose
            [i do not know what it is about you
            that closes and opens
            only something in me understands
            the voice of your eyes is deeper
            than
            all roses]

elliot turns on a light  the camera stays on his face as he
looks off into the distance mouthing indistinctly the line
of poetry lee next reads

                         lee vo
                   continuing reading
            nobody not even the rain has
            such small hands

the film leaves elliots face and cuts back to the loft
where lee having finished the poem sits up in the bed
staring pensively lost in her thoughts

mickeys comprehensive exam

first is a hearing test and the movie cuts to a darkened
hearingtest room  a light goes on revealing a slouched
over mickey sitting in a glass booth  he is wearing a set
of headphones  the camera moves back revealing a technician
at the console on the other side of the booth  mickey
signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset
the jazz continues

next is an electronystagmography eng  graph paper rolls
out of a machine and after a brief glimpse of the rolling
paper the camera moves over to show mickey lying terrified
without his glasses on a couch with electrodes stuck all
over his head

the film then cuts to a bser test room where mickey
sitting in a corner chair wears another set of headphones
an electrode is attached to his forehead a nearby technician
sits at a computer video screen looking at a monitoring
graph
last but not least is the tomography  over the shoulders of
a technician in a booth a large window displays a huge
white rotating machine  it makes a whooshing noise as it
turns  the camera moves down the giant cranelike device to
reveal mickey once again lying down this time on a table
his eyes closed underneath it

                   on one of the xrays

mickey stares at the xray horrified

            marriages become unstable and are
            destroyed by an inability to deal
            with this sort of problem  i hope
            you wont make too much of it  one
            can adopt children and there are

            and i ever did was the one we won
            the emmy for

mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room holding
a halfeaten chocolate cake on a serving plate  the sun
pours through the windows he passes  hannah is briefly seen
in the background preparing more coffee in the kitchen

                         mickey
            yeahii think as i think as far
            as laughs i mean just plain
            laughs you know that was probably
            the best thing that we ever did

mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table which is
already crowded with assorted plants plates and a bamboo
tray holding utensils and napkins

                         norman
                   agreeing
            mmhm

                         carol
                   overlapping her
                   hands over her
                   crossed knees and nodding
            yeah it was funny it was very
            funny  but the show was about the
            two frenchmen now that was funny
            and it was warm

mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch  he rubs
his forehead

                         norman
                   to carol gesturing
                   with his cup
            we got that idea on that trip to
            paris

                         carol
                   nodding
            right

                         norman
                   smiling
            hmm

                         carol
                   to the offscreen hannah
            do you remember that summer in
            france  hannah you had jet lag
            for six straight weeks

norman chuckles

                         mickey
                   sighing almost mumbling
            yeah but it was you know i guess

                         norman
                   overlapping nodding

hannah walks over to the group holding a pot of coffee
she awkwardly steps past mickey to pour coffee for norman
and carol

                         hannah
                   to mickey

                         hannah

                         mickey
                   overlapping coughing
            yeah

hannah refills carols cup  she puts the pot down on the
coffee table and sits down next to mickey

                         mickey
                   standing up and gesturing
            jeez this is this is this is
            very delicate andand i only bring

he starts to pace  hannah her hands clasped near her face
glances briefly at carol

                         mickey
                   turning to the group
                   as he paces behind
                   the couch
            i mean
                   grunting
            this is uh this should not go
            any further than this room

                   sipping his coffee
            im all ears

hannah sighs  mickey pauses for a moment collecting his
thoughts

                         mickey
                   gesturing and pacing
            hannah and icant have any
            children  now iii dont want to
            get into whose fault it
                   gesturing

            andand the details are too
            embarrassing to

                         hannah
                   interrupting
                   nervously picking at
                   her fingers
            wwweweve decided after a lot of
            discussion that wewed try with
            artificial insemination

mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group

                         mickey
                   putting his hands on
                   his hips
            yeah im not so sure that i that
            i like that idea myself anyway

he starts to pace behind the couch anew

                         hannah
                   overlapping
            um ii didnt really want to you
            know go to a sperm bank or
            something have some anonymous
            donor

            ii just you know iii wouldnt
            want that

                         mickey
                   pacing
            right  we felt that if we were
            gonna do it that we would like
            somebody who we knew and who we
            liked and who was warm and bright
            and

norman and carol remain silent

                         hannah
            and you can say no you know
            feel free to say no  wwe realize
            it has all kinds of implications

mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind norman

                         mickey
            yeah but thethe point that uh
            that were making here is that we
            need some sperm

mickey rubbing his hands on his knees leans back against
the wall  norman and carol turn to each other reacting

                         norman
                   sighing
            gee
                   chuckling
            well my first reaction after the
            initial shock is uh flattered
            that you would ask me
                   chuckling nervously


carol glances at norman

                         mickey
                   pointing at himself
            yeah well i would be the father
                   pointing to norman
            you would just have to masturbate
            into a little cup

                         norman
                   shrugging
            i can handle that

                         hannah
                   scooting closer to
                   carol and norman on
                   the couch gesturing
            obviously we wouwouldnt have
            intercourse

she chuckles nervously

                         carol
                   to hannah chuckling
                   nervously briefly
            gosh listen

                         hannah
                   putting her hand on
                   carols shoulder
            carol i know its a lot to ask

                         carol

            you know take it home and think
            about it for a while

                         norman
                   holding his coffee
                   cup thoughtful
            i gave blood before and uh
            clothing to the poor

                         carol
                   to norman scratching
                   her ear
            okay norman listen i really want
            to talk about this at home
                   nodding as hannah
                   looks briefly
                   offscreen at mickey
            i think its a matter for your
            analystand mine

                         norman
                   emphatically
            and maybe my lawyer

he takes a sip of coffee

                         hannah
                   gesturing
            you know wewe understand
            completely if you know if you

                   chuckling nervously
            i didnt mean to spoil the evening
                   rubbing her hands
            now lets move on to another topic

hannah reaches for the cake as carol and norman exchange
glances reacting

the flashback ends  mickey is back in the present in his
darkened living room illuminated by a glow from a window
behind the couch  a coffee table sits in front of the couch
papers are scattered on the floor  mickey gets up from the
couch where hed been sitting  he paces back and forth as
he talks over the screen

                         mickey vo
            so you had my expartners baby
            twins  maybe that did cause some
            trouble but
                   sighing
            i think we were drifting apart
            anyhow  now instead of man and
            wife were just good friends  boy
            love is really unpredictable

                                            cut to

int metropolitan opera house  night

manon lescaut is being performed  onstage the soprano in
the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the
ruins of a wagon  the background is dark  the film moves
up to the private boxes in the upper loge  david and holly
can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes
david glances at her he reaches down for a bottle of wine
the movie briefly cuts back to the stage  the soprano is
leaning on a wagon wheel her voice soars  then its back
to a closer look at holly and david in their box  the aria
continues as david hands a smiling holly a glass  he
uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses
holly mouths a thank you glancing around  they look at
each other and raise their glasses in a toast

                                            cut to

        dusty bought this huge house in southampton

the opera audience is heard cheering applauding and
sounding their bravos

the clapping stops as the movie cuts to fredericks loft
it is day  lee wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans has
opened the door for elliot and his client wealthy rock star
dusty frye

                         elliot
                   leading the way into
                   the loft gesturing
            lee fredericksay hello to dusty
            frye

lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to dusty

                         lee
                   shaking dustys hand
            hi dusty

                         dusty
            hi

lee chuckles as she looks at him he is wearing sunglasses
a redimprinted tshirt and a baggy coat  she turns and
walks with frederick elliot and dusty farther into the
loft her hands clasped behind her back

                         elliot
                   as he walks
            dustys just bought a huge house in
            southampton and hes in the process
            of decorating it

                         dusty
            yeah  its kind of a weird place

                   chuckling


                         lee
            oh

they walk into the living room area of the loft where
frederick his hands in his pockets neatly attired in vest
sweater and white shirt stands waiting

                         dusty
                   to frederick giving
                   him a hip handshake

                   enthusiastic frederick
            i told him about your work and
            hes very excited

                         dusty

                   crosses his arms on
                   his chest
            if you stare at that stella too
            long the colors just seem to float
            its kinda weird

frederick covers his face to hide his disgust

                         lee
                   chuckling her arms crossed
            are you excited about becoming a
            collector
                         dusty
            yeah

                         lee
                   nodding
            yeah

                         dusty
                   shrugging

            a kid

                         lee

            uhhuh

                         frederick
                   addressing but not
                   looking at dusty
            do you appreciate drawings

                         dusty
                   shrugging
            yeah
                   chuckling as he
                   notices and points to
                   some offscreen
                   drawings frederick
                   has set up
            oh!  hey!  wow!
                   pointing to an
                   offscreen nude drawing
            shes beautiful  but uh really
            iiii need something im
            looking for something big

as dusty talks the camera follows elliot who walks past
the others to examine the drawings more closely  two framed
nude drawings of lee are propped up on an easel  elliot
glances admiringly at the drawings then surreptitiously at
lee admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen
dusty and frederick

                         lee
                   looking at an
                   offscreen frederick gesturing
            big  frederick show him the oils

                         frederick
                   offscreen
            theyre in the basement

the camera leaves elliot to follow the enthusiastic lee as
she takes dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the
door  frederick follows at a distance

                         lee
                   to dusty
            fredericks done this whole new

                   overlapping muttering

                   chuckling


                         frederick
                   angrily stopping in
                   his tracks
            i dont sell my work by the yard!

                         lee
                   chuckling reacting
            oh frederick!

the camera now moves back to elliot still staring at the
nude drawings as the sounds of fredericks and dustys
footsteps are heard leaving the loft  he turns and
hesitantly smiles to an offscreen lee

                         elliot
                   chuckling softly
            hows everything

                         lee
                   walking onscreen
                   towards elliot
            oh you knowi talked to hannah

                         elliot
            yeah she loves to go out in the
            woods

                         lee
                   nodding her arms
                   clasped around her chest
            oh yeah

                         elliot
                   chuckling

                         elliot
            oh thats nice

theres an awkward moment of silence

                         elliot
                   breaking the silence
                   pointing in the
                   direction of the door
            i figured id get uh frederick
            and dusty together

                         lee
                   looking in the same
                   direction gesturing
            oh yeah thats really nice of you

                         elliot
            yes  this kid hes earned a
            trillion dollars

                         lee
                   nodding wrapping
                   her arms around her
                   chest again
            oh

                         elliot
            hes got like six gold records

                         lee
                   gesturing relieved
                   that shes found
                   something to say
            oh speaking of recordsi bought
            that mozart trio you recommended

the camera follows lee as she walks quickly to the stereo
unit pulling a record off the shelf

                         lee
                   continuing
            and the man in the record shop
            showed me another one that i think
            youd love  its a another
            bach second movement

she pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the
turntable

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            oh youyou have that one

                         lee
                   working at the
                   stereo turning her
                   head towards elliot
            yeah

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            oh i would love to hear it

bachs concerto for harpsichord fills the room

                         lee
                   putting the turntable
                   cover in place
            oh and holly met a wonderful man
            who loves opera  an architect

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            oh thats nice  id love to see
            her wind up settled  shes a tense
            one
                   chuckling


the record in place lee turns and leans back against the
stereo unit  she listens to the music her eyes closed
the record plays for a few moments in the quiet room as
elliot walks over to lee and leans against the shelf near her

                         lee
                   intently
            isnt that beautiful

                         elliot
                   looking at lee his
                   hands clasped in
                   front of him
            i know this  bach  f minor
            concerto  its one of my favorites

lee smiling continues to listen to the music her head
down elliot stares at her

                         elliot
                   after a pause
            uhdid you ever get around to ee
            cummings

                         lee
                   wrapping her arms
                   around her chest and
                   looking away from
                   elliot for a moment
            yes hes just adorable

elliot nods

                         lee
                   awkwardly
            they have a very large gay
            clientele you know where i get my
            teeth cleaned andall the
            hygienists now wear gloves because
            theyre afraid of aids

                         elliot
                   taking a breath
            oh right

there is another moment of silence  elliot stares at lee
who continues to look down her arms around her chest  the
harpsichord plays on

                         elliot
                   softly
            did you ever get around to the poem
            on page a hundred and twelve

                         lee
            yes it made me cry
                   tentatively looking
                   at elliot
            it was so beautifulso romantic

lee looks down again the music plays softly and elliot
continues to stare at her thinking

                         elliot vo
            i want so badly to kiss her  not
            here you idiot  youve got to get
            her alone someplace

as elliots thoughts are heard over the scene lee glances
around the loft then begins to walk away  the camera
follows her as she goes past the nude drawings which become
the focus of attention as lee walks offscreen

                         elliot vo
            but ive got to proceed cautiously
            this is a very delicate situation
            okay uhask her if you can see
            her for lunch or a drink tomorrow

lee walks back onscreen to the bookshelf behind the drawings
she takes the ee cummings book from the shelf and flips
through it as she walks back to elliot who is still leaning
by the stereo still ruminating

                         elliot vo
            and be ready to make light of the
            offer if shes unresponsive  this
            has to be done very skillfully
            very diplomatically

                         lee
                   showing elliot a
                   poem in her book
            did you ever read this one

elliot leaps up grabs lee and kisses her passionately
lee surprised pushes him away

                         lee
            elliot!  dont!

                         elliot
            lee!  lee!  lee im in love with
            you

he kisses lee again  he clumsily turns around she humps
against the stereo unit  as lee pulls away she smashes
into the turntable  the needle scratches loudly  lee
shocked is gasping  the record pushed to a different part
of the concerto now plays a more complicated faster fugue

                         elliot
                   breathing hard
            oh!

                         lee
                   gasping
            what are you doing!

                         elliot
                   frantically
            iimimimim sorry  i have
            to talk to you for theres so
            much that i want to tell you

lee stares at elliot in shock

                         lee
                   still gasping
            elliot!

                         elliot
                   gesturing desperately
            i have been in love with you for so
            long

frederick and dustys indistinct voices raised in argument
are suddenly heard  elliot quickly turns away from lee
she tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft
entranceway  frederick enters the loft first followed by a
confused dusty  they stride across the loft past lee who
is standing by the stereo  elliot standing near the nude
drawings is looking through a book

                         frederick
                   angrily
            please forget it!  i dont have any
            interest in selling anything!

                         dusty
                   gesturing
            i ask you if you have something
            with a little puce in it you gotta
            fly off the handle!

                         lee
                   in a slightly
                   higherpitched voice
            whats the problem

                         frederick
                   pulling the nude
                   drawings off his
                   easel angrily
            im not interested in what your
            interior decorator would think
            okay!

                         dusty
                   overlapping gesturing
            well i cant commit to anything
            without consulting her first
            thats what i have her for okay

                         frederick
                   carrying the drawings
                   off
            this is degrading!  you dont buy
            paintings to blend in with the sofa!

                         dusty
                   looking after frederick
            its not a sofa its an ottoman!
                   touching his
                   forehead turning to elliot
            god forget it!  lets just get
            outta here elliot

                         elliot
                   putting down the book
            well go

the film moves outside the loft building  dusty and elliot
emerge and walk to dustys waiting limousine  elliot is
rubbing his forehead anguished

                         dusty
                   angrily getting
                   into the car
            what a weirdo that guy is!  paranoid
                   noticing elliots
                   anguished face
            whats the matter with you

                         elliot
                   gesturing
            look iiill be okay  ill be okay

                         dusty
                   overlapping
            its not that big a deal  we just
            didnt hit it off

                         elliot
                   gesturing
            now look youyouyou go on ahead

                         dusty

                         elliot
                   overlapping nervously

            somesome fresh air  its probably
            something i ate  illill walk
            you go ahead

dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door
elliot leans down to the chauffeurs window signaling for
him to start driving

                         elliot
                   continuing gesturing
            you go  go on  go

the limousine drives off  elliot runs to a phone booth
across the street  he picks up the phone and dials

the film cuts to frederick in his loft standing near the
phone  it rings  frederick picks it up

                         frederick
                   into the telephone
            hello  hello  hello

when no one answers frederick reacting hangs up and the
film moves back outside to the phone booth where elliot
the phone receiver to his ear listens for a moment then
hangs up  he walks out of the booth reacting then walks
down the sidewalk where he bumps into a frantic lee just
turning the corner

                         lee
                   gesturing in relief
            oh!  there you are!

elliot mumbles relieved and confused

                         lee
            i was looking for you

                         elliot
                   gesturing

                         lee
                   gesturing
            well how do you expect me to react
            to such a thing

elliot uneasy glances up in the direction of fredericks
loft  he leads lee a few yards up the street away from any
prying eyes

                         elliot
                   taking lees arm
            wh uh i know i know but i am
            in love with you

                         lee

                         elliot
                   overlapping shaking
                   his head
            ii im sorry  i know its
            terrible

                         lee
                   pushing back her
                   hair shaking her
                   head hopelessly
            why you know the situation

she sighs

                         elliot
                   looking away for a moment
            i know!  iiii i realize

                         lee

                   emphatically
            your guilt is because you feel the

a taxi turns a west side street corner and stops in front of
evan and normas building which is decorated with a long
metal awning  its an overcast day

a station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls
away as hannah a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder
gets out of the cab  she runs into the building the taxi
drives away  a piano plays bewitched over the screen

opens it to hannah

hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her
aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen  he
passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed
photographs

                         evan
            shes in the kitchen there  its
            the same thing  same thing  she
            promises promises
                   gesturing
            but its all lies

through a doorway norma can be seen sitting on a chair in
the kitchen  she wears a robe over a slip and stockings
shes drinking  evan stands in the doorway looking at her
he doesnt go in

                         hannah
                   offscreen patiently
            dont make it worse dad

hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen
her mother takes a sip of her drink

                         hannah
            hi mom  how you doing  here let
            me get you some coffee  thats
            enough of that
                   taking away her
                   mothers drink to evan
            what triggered it

                         evan
                   gesturing as norma
                   turns her head and
                   watches him
            we were making a commercial down at
            the mayors office and there was
            this young goodlooking salesman

norma reacts turning to her daughter  hannah however has
her back turned  she is busy taking charge in the kitchen
as evan speaks  she takes some pills out of a cupboard and
hands them to her mother with a glass of water

                         evan
                   continuing
            and your mother was throwing
            herself at him in a disgusting way
            and when she found she was too old
            to seduce him that he was just
            embarrassed by her

                         norma
                   angrily interrupting
                   turning her head
            liar!  liar!

the camera moves to evan who continues to tell his story
ignoring his wifes outburst as he walks away from the
kitchen doorway into the den

                         evan
            then at lunch she got drunker and
            drunker
                   shouting over his shoulder
            and finally she became joan collins!

evan walks over to the piano where several framed family
photographs sit in a line on its top  he picks one up as
norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen

                         norma
                   offscreen
            all my life ive had to put up with
            insults

the camera moves back to the kitchen as norma talks  she is
still glaring offscreen at the doorway where evan stood
moments before  she holds the water glass and the pills
                         norma
                   continuing dramatically
            from this nonperson this th
            ththis haircut that passes for a
            man
                   turning to look at
                   the offscreen hannah
            he could never support us  its a
            good thing we had a talented
            daughter!

evan is back in the doorway listening to norma getting
more and more angry  as he makes a retort he starts to
walk back to the den and his piano

                         evan
            i can only hope that she was mine
            with you as her mother
                   gesturing his voice
                   getting louder
            her father could be anybody in
            actors equity!

                         norma
            shes talentedso its not likely
            shes yours!
                   taking a sip of water


                         hannah
                   walking over to the
                   doorway to speak to
                   evan whos already

            of her

hannah goes back to norma she takes the glass of water away

                         evan
                   offscreen choosing
                   to ignore hannahs suggestion
            you never know when shes going to
            fall off the wagon and humiliate
            everybody

hannah choosing to ignore evans remark hands her mother a
cup of coffee she puts her mothers hands on the cup

                         hannah
            here mom  drink this

                   kitchen counter

            probably were flirting

                         norma
                   sipping her coffee
            no!  i like to joke around and have

                         norma
                   shaking her head
            the sacrifices ive made because of
            that man
                   inhaling
            hes ruined me with his ego his
            philandering his

                         norma

                         hannah
                   quietly

                         norma

            screen test

                         hannah
                   patiently
            yeah i know mom
                         norma

                   touching hannahs
                   arm again then
                   touching her chest
            now how can you act when theres
            nothing inside to come out!

norma sips her coffee softly sobbing  hannah reacting
walks away from the counter and capping the bottle of
pills puts them back in the cupboard  evan plays the piano
offscreen  the camera moves in on hannahs face as she
reflects her voice heard over the screen

                         hannah vo
            she was so beautiful at one time
            and he was so dashing  both of
            them just full of promise and hopes
            that never materialized

the camera leaves hannahs face as she continues to reflect
it moves to the den to the row of family photos on the
piano one of a presentday evan and norma others where
both norma and evan are young beautiful hopeful  the
music plays on

                         hannah vo
            and the fights and the constant
            infidelities to prove
            themselvesand blaming each other
            its ssad  they loved the idea of
            having us kids but raising us
            didnt interest them much  but
            its impossible to hold it against
            them  they didnt know anything
            else

the film cuts back to the kitchen  norma stands up hannah
takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter

                         norma
            you know of all of us in the
            family you were the one blessed
            with the true gift

she puts her arm around hannahs shoulder  mother and
daughter walk out of the kitchen

                         hannah
                   holding the hand her
                   mother had placed on
                   her shoulder
            ohhh my true gift is luck mom

norma chuckles

                         hannah
                   overlapping
            i just had a lot of luckfrom my
            first show you know  ive always
            thought lee was the one destined
            for great things

                         norma
            yes shes lovely but she doesnt
            have your spark
                   gesturing and chuckling
            she knows it  she worships you
            she wouldnt dare get up there on
            the stage

                         hannah
                   looking at her mother
            now hollys not shy

they stop at the entrance to the den  evan can be seen
playing the piano as they continue their conversation

                         norma
            no hollys game for anything
            holly takes after me

                         norma
                   shaking her head
            id have been a great dope addict

norma chortles  hannah laughs touching her mother  they
walk over to evan at the piano

                         evan
                   looking up
            remember this hannah

evan plays a few bars of you are too beautiful as mother
and daughter their backs to the camera listen  norma
leans over the piano hannah looks off into the distance
deep in reflection  the piano music continues in the
background as the movie cuts to

lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront  the wind blows
her hair she hugs the ee cummings book to her chest
she too is deep in thought  she stops at the edge of the
wharf the camera continues to move to a group of wooden
pilings nearby lapped by the water

int hospital catscan room  day

the quiet continues as the film cuts to a closeup of a
large circular catscan module in an antiseptic hospital
room  a slowly moving stretcher bearing mickeys strapped
prone body begins to enter the round opening of the module
as the camera pulls back from mickey his taped head under
the scan two technicians can be seen through the window
separating the scanner from the control room  one of them
sitting down taps information into a computer while the
other technician stands nearby looking from mickey to the
computer screen

the movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen showing
an image of mickeys skull  scan lines bleep over the skull
the camera moves up from the screen to reveal mickey once
again as seen through the window silent and serious under
the catscan module

from mickeys prone form the film moves to the two
technicians as seen through the window in the scanner room
they examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to
each other  one of the men nodding taps more information
into the computer

while theyre studying the catscan picture the camera cuts
to a back view of mickey under the module  there is a
sciencefiction feel to this scene as if mickey is lying in
the center of a huge white futuristic circle  the
stretcher bearing mickey slowly moves out of the module

dr brooks holding mickeys xrays walks past a row of
bookshelves to his light panel  he props up the xrays

                         dr brooks
            mr sachs
                   sighing
            im afraid the news is not good

dr brooks turns to an offscreen mickey

                         dr brooks
                   continuing taking a
                   pencil out of his pocket
            if i can show you exactly where the
            tumor is and why we feel that
            surgery would be of no use

the film quickly cuts to a closeup of mickeys face
reacting in total despair  he closes his eyes he covers
his face with his hand

                         mickey vo
            its over  im facetoface with
            eternity

                   offscreen
            grown quite large without being
            detected
                   trailing off
                   indistinctly as
                   mickey continues his
                   anguished ramblings


                         mickey vo
            not later but now  im so
            frightened i cant move speak or
            breathe

as mickey finishes his speech the real dr brooks is seen
walking into the office  the previous scene had been a
figment of mickeys imagination a nightmare fantasy only
holding mickeys xrays the real dr brooks walks past
the same row of books to the light panel

                         dr brooks
            well youre just fine  theres
            absolutely nothing here at all
            and your tests are all fine
                   switching on the
                   light on the panel
                   and propping up the
                   xrays
            i must admit i was concerned
            given your symptoms
                   turning to look at
                   the offscreen mickey
            what caused this hearing loss in
            one ear i guess well never really
            know for sure  but whatever it
            was its certainly not anything
            serious at all
                   nodding
            im very relieved

once again mickey is seen leaving the building but this
time he bounds down the steps jumping for joy  he runs
swirling down the street clapping his hands happy with
relief  upbeat uptempo jazz plays in the background

stops his hand to his mouth reflecting

as mickey continues to talk offscreen gail closes the
cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind mickeys
desk

                         mickey

                         mickey
                   shaking his head
                   his hand to his chest
            i cant stay on this show  i gotta
            get some answers  otherwise
                   pausing and holding
                   his head
            im telling you im going to do
            something drastic

                                            cut to

the entrance to the st regis hotel elegant and warmly lit
in the night  pedestrians pass  baroque harpsichord music
plays over the scene  the camera moves up the hotels
façade past its welcoming flags to its ornate windows
several floors up

as the harpsichord continues to play the film moves inside
to one of the hotel rooms  elliot his back to the camera
is opening the door to lee

elliot closes the door behind her as she enters  they stand
very close to each other framed by the door and a stark
subtly striped wallpapered wall

                         elliot
                   looking intensely at
                   lee his hands in his pockets
            i thought you werent coming

                         lee
            i almost didnt

                         elliot
                   putting his hand on
                   her shoulder wanting
                   to kiss her
            lee uh

                         lee
            i didnt sleep all night

                         elliot
                   taking his hand
                   away gesturing to
                   the room
            no nonono im sure

they walk towards the camera further into the room  elliot
puts his arm around lee

                         lee
            what are we doing meeting in a
            hotel room  its terrible isnt it

the music stops  the camera follows lee as she walks
towards the curtained windows past a fireplace a mirror
some innocuous pictures a delicate table holding a lamp
the foot of the bed

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            ii couldnt think where to invite
            you without taking risks

                         lee
            i promised myself i wouldnt let
            this happen till you were living
            alone  i was so torn when you
            called

she parts a corner of the curtains looking out the window
turning when elliot speaks

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            ive wanted to call you everyday
            since i first told you how i felt

he walks over to lee by the curtained windows

                         elliot
            i resisted so many times
                   pausing
            dont think badly of me

he takes lee into his arms

                         elliot
            this is not an easy situation

                         lee
                   whispering
            i know it isnt

they kiss their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow
of the room  elliot takes lees coat off without breaking
the kiss  they embrace  they kiss each other lightly then
stronger more passionately their embrace much tighter

and its later that night  the harpsichord music begins to
play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal
lee lying contentedly under the sheets her hair fanned out
on the pillows one arm near her head

                         lee
            that was just perfect  youve
            ruined me for anyone else

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            i dont want anyone else ever to
            have you

                         lee
                   sighing
            i was so worried i wouldnt compare
            with hannah

                         elliot
                   offscreen laughing
            oh my god

he enters the screen sitting down on the edge of the bed
next to lee  he holds a cigarette

                         elliot
            you really do have those thoughts
            dont you

                         lee
                   chuckling touching
                   elliots arm
            oh all the time

elliot chuckles they hold hands

                         lee
            i know she must be a really
            passionate person

                         elliot
                   looking at their
                   clasped hands
            yes shes shes very warm but
            but itits me that wants to be
            giving to you  iii want to do
            things for you  hannah doesnt
            need me as much
                   chuckling as lee laughs
            im being presumptuous  not that
            you need me

                         lee
                   nodding
            i want you to take care of me
            and i love when you do things to me

elliot leans down to lee they begin to kiss passionately

                                            cut to

ext street outside fredericks loft  night

lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain shes bareheaded
the streets are dark  a car drives by a pedestrian passes
holding an umbrella  lee passes a restaurant well lit
inside by hanging lamps  the baroque music continues as she
enters the loft her head soaked  she closes the door
touching her soaking hair

                         frederick
                   offscreen
            youre late

lee walks through the lofts living room area unbelting her
coat towards the bathroom  she passes frederick who sits
at a table in the kitchen area drinking a cup of coffee and
reading the paper  a plate with a halfeaten sandwich sits
in front of him  the music stops

                         lee
                   opening the bathroom door
            lucy and i kept talking and i
            didnt realize how late it had
            gotten

                         frederick
                   barely glancing up
                   from his paper
            you missed a very dull tv show
            about auschwitz  more gruesome
            film clipsand more puzzled
            intellectuals declaring their
            mystification over the systematic
            murder of millions

as he talks lee is seen turning on the bathroom light  she
takes off her coat hanging it on a hook then begins to dry
her hair with a towel

                         frederick
                   turning his head
                   slightly in lees
                   direction and gesturing
            the reason why they could never
            answer the question how could it
            possibly happen is that its the
            wrong question  given what people
            are the question is
                   swallowing
            why doesnt it happen more often
            of course it does in subtler forms

frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of
coffee as lee walks out of the bathroom tossing the towel
down on the counter

                         lee
                   moving her fingers
                   through her wet hair
            i have a little headache from this
            weather

she takes a kettle and fills it with water

                         frederick
                   grunting sipping
                   his coffee
            its been ages since i sat in front
            of the tv just changing channels
            to find something

as frederick continues his monologue lee is busy in the
background striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on
the stove for the kettle taking a glass out of the cupboard
walking into the bathroom for some pills filling the glass
with water in the kitchen sink and taking her pills

                         frederick
            you see the whole culturenazis
            deodorant salesman

            talk show can you imagine the
            level of a mind that watches
            wrestling
                   gesturing
            hmm  but the worst are the
            fundamentalist preachersthird
            rate con men telling the poor
            suckers that watch them that they
            speak for jesusand to please

                   picking up his sandwich
            money money money!  if jesus came
            back and saw whats going on in
            his name hed never stop throwing
            up

he takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee  lee
sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the
bedroom area

                         lee
                   impatiently her
                   hands in her hair
            oh god frederick could you
            please lighten up!  im really not
            in the mood to hear a review of
            contemporary society again

she starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed  frederick
takes off his glasses  he turns and looks at lee in surprise

                         frederick
                   standing up from the table
            you know youve been very nervous
            lately

                         lee
                   sighing
            i cant take this anymore

                         frederick
                   walking over to the bed
            im just trying to complete an
            education i started on you five
            years ago

                         lee
                   unbuttoning her blouse
            im not your pupil
                   sighing her hands
                   at her side
            i was but im not

                         frederick
                   sitting down on the
                   edge of the bed
            when you leave the nest i just
            want you to be ready to face the
            real world

he pulls lee down next to him on the bed

                         lee
                   putting her hand on
                   fredericks leg
            frederick were going to have to
            make some changes

she sighs

                         frederick
                   quickly looking at
                   lee alarmed
            like what

                         lee
            oh you know what  im suffocating!

                         frederick
                   turning away his
                   hands clasped in
                   front of him
            oh!  are we going to have this
            conversation again

                         lee

            conversation again  ii have to

                         frederick
                   shaking his clasped
                   hands intensely
            why

                         lee
                   sighing
            because i have to!

                         frederick
                   emotionally

                         lee
                   hugging her arm with
                   her other hand
            well maybe itll only be temporary
            but i hai have to try

                         frederick
                   taking lees head in
                   his hands and looking
                   at her
            ohlee you are my whole world

                         lee
                   reacting pushing
                   fredericks hands
                   from her face
            no

                         frederick
                   reacting
            oh yes you have!

                         lee
                   quickly standing up defensively
            no

                         frederick
                   raising his voice
            youve been with someone!

                         lee
                   overlapping running
                   away from the bed
            stop accusing me!

lee runs into the kitchen her hands tight around her chest

                         frederick
                   offscreen
            im too smart lee!  you cant fool
            me!  youre turning all red!

lee fraught with emotion briefly puts her outstretched
hands on the refrigerator door then turns around and leans
against it hugging herself her blouse still unbuttoned
her hair still wet and bedraggled

                         lee
            leave me alone!

frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the
counter

                         frederick
                   angrily
            oh christ!  whats wrong with you!

                         lee
                   leaning against the
                   refrigerator sighing

                         frederick
            oh couldnt you say something

                         lee
                   overlapping her
                   voice emotionally raised
            im saying it now!

                         frederick
            so you met somebody else

                         lee

            but you god you knew that was
            going to happen sooner or later  i

                         frederick
                   turning to face lee
                   in the bathroom his

            who is it

                         lee
                   frantically putting
                   things in her purse
                   glaring at frederick
            whats the difference!  its just

lee turns and faces frederick in the bathroom doorway

                         lee
                   gesturing emotionally
            oh god thats too much

            late

                         frederick
                   reacting his face
                   in his hand
            jesusjesus!

                         lee
                   gesturing moving
                   closer to frederick
            oh god i dont even know what i
            want

                         frederick
                   sighing heavily reacting
            oh

                         lee
                   rubbing fredericks
                   shoulder tenderly
            tch oh what do you get out of me
            anyway  i mean
                   laying her head
                   against his shoulder
                   sighing deeply
            its not sexual anymore  its
            certainly not intellectual  i
            mean youre so superior to me in
            every way that

frederick furiously shakes lee away  he pounds his fist
against a cupboard  lee gasping moves away

                         frederick
            please dont patronize me!

he puts his hand on his forehead then turns to the offscreen
lee

                         frederick
            god!  i should have married you
            years ago when you wanted to!  i
            should have agreed

he walks over to lee in another area of the kitchen

                         lee
                   sighing
            oh god dont you know it never
            would have worked

frederick turns away from lee  he begins to pace near the
counter

                         frederick
            i told you one day you would leave
            me
                   leaning on the counter
            for a younger man  i

he loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and
frustration then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow

                                            cut to

int hannahs bedroom  night

hannah wearing a plaid shirt sits up in bed a book
propped up on her knees  a cupboard with some bricabrac
is mounted behind the night table which holds a small
white warmglowing lamp and some photographs  she turns
the page as elliot in pajamas and silk bathrobe enters
she continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge
of the bed and muses  his voice is heard over the screen

                         elliot vo
            what passion today with lee  shes
            a volcano  it was a totally
            fulfilling experience just as i
            dreamed it would be
                   nodding slightly as
                   he takes off his slippers
            thats what it was  it was like
            living out a dreama great dream
                   taking off his bathrobe
            now i feel very good and cozy being
            here next to hannah  theres
            something very lovely and real
            about hannah
                   tossing his bathrobe
                   aside and lying down
                   on the bed next to
                   hannah his hands
                   crossed over his stomach
            she gives me a very deep feeling of
            being part of something  shes a
            wonderful womanand i betrayed
            her  she came into my empty life
            and changed itand i paid her
            back by banging her sister in a
            hotel room  god im despicable
            what a cruel and shallow thing to
            do
                   sitting up
            i have to call her now and tell her
            what we did was crazy

            hannah too much  i love my wife
            now ive betrayed her  oh god!

elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room

                         hannah
                   reading not looking up
            wherere you going

                         elliot
                   offscreen

            phone number in my desk  i forgot

                         hannah
                   still reading
            its so late

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            yeah i know  ii cant believe i
            forgot

elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway

                         elliot
                   muttering
            what if he answers
                   turning into the
                   doorway leading to
                   the living room
            ill hang up

                   darkened living room
            ill tell her we cant communicate
            until i terminate my marriage
                   whispering
            its immoral

elliot switches on the light  he paces back and forth in
front of the piano and an accompanying music stand  the top
of the piano is filled with family photos the lamp he
turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and
the piece of sheet music open on the piano

                         elliot
                   gesturing and whispering
            then time will pass  i wont

            gotta stop this before i get in too
            deep  id rather hurt lee a
            little than destroy hannah

elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch

                         elliot
                   whispering rubbing
                   his hands

            frederick goes jogging at six
            yeah shell be alone  and ill
            ill call her and nip it in the bud

the phone rings  elliot jumps

                         elliot
                   loudly to the
                   offscreen hannah gasping
            ive got it!  ive got it!  ive
            got it!
                   picking up the
                   phone into the telephone
            hello
                   loudly for the
                   offscreen hannahs benefit
            mel!

the movie cuts to lee standing in the dark in fredericks
loft  she talks softly into the telephone

                         lee
                   into the telephone
            i would have hung up if you hadnt
            answered and i promise i wont ever
            do this again but i just had to
            tell you i feel very close to you
            tonight  very very close
                   pausing
            good night

lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to elliot
standing in his living room  stunned he slowly lowers the
phone receiver

                                            cut to

 the only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life
                 is meaningless  tolstoy

jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a
university library the camera focused on a huge replica of
rodins thinker before moving to the front entrance  mickey
can be seen emerging from its depths  he wears his raincoat
his hands are in his pockets  he ponders the scene as he
walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the
sidewalk  passersby some holding books are seen

                         mickey vo
            millions of books written on every
            conceivable subject by all these
            great minds and and in the end
            none of em knows anything more
            about the big questions of life
            than i do  ssi read socrates
            you know nnn this guy used to
            knknock off little greek boys
            what the hells he got to teach me
            and and nietzsche with his with
            his theory of eternal recurrence
            he said that the life we live
            were gonna live over and over
            again the exact same way for
            eternity  great  that means i
            uh ill have to sit through the
            ice capades again  tch  its not
            worth it

the movie next cuts to a sunny day in central park  a male
jogger seen through some tree branches runs by  the
camera moves past him revealing a pondering mickey walking
by the reservoir  he continues to talk over the screen

                         mickey vo
            and and freud another great
            pessimist  jeez i was in analysis
            for years  nothing happened  my
            poor analyst got so frustrated
            the guy finally put in a salad bar

several joggers pass mickey he continues to ruminate

                         mickey vo
            oh!  look at all these people
            joggingtrying to stave off the
            inevitable decay of the body  boy
                   smacking his lips
            its so sad what people go through
            with theirtheir stationary bike
            and their exercise and their
                   glancing at a fat
                   woman jogger in a red
                   sweatsuit who runs by
            oh!  look at this one!  poor
            thing  my god she has to tote all
            that fat around  maybe the poets
            are right  maybe love is the only
            answer

mickey goes over to the chainlink fence encircling the
reservoir  he stops walking and looks out over the water

                         mickey vo
            shhof course i was in love with
            hannah  that didnt work out too
            well
                   sighing
            i even took her sister out
            remember that

mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and
the distant skyline  a jogger crosses in front of him
its very quiet the soft jazz continues

                         mickey vo
            remember years ago when hannah and
            i got divorced and she fixed me up
            with her sister holly

the film cuts abruptly to mickeys flashback of his date
with holly beginning with a rock club performance  the
soft jazz becomes loud pulsating rock  three punkersa
girl with pink hair a girl with a spiked mohawk and a guy
with stevie wonder braids and sunglasseswatch and bop
their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band the 39
steps

the camera moves to the stage revealing a sleazylooking
rock band in the midst of their number

                         the 39 steps
                   singing
            i want to be like you
            i said im going to fit into your
            group

as the band loudly plays on the camera moves across the
spellbound audience sitting at crowded smoky small
tables to reveal a stricken mickey and a mesmerized holly
squeezed together at one of them  a nearby member of the
audience swills beer from a bottle  holly beating time to
the music and enjoying herself takes a puff of her cigarette
she wears a wristful of silver bracelets  she glances at
mickey impatiently  hes the only one in the place wearing
a suit

                         the 39 steps
                   singing
            i dont wanna be different
            said im gonna be just like you
            because im gonna buy the records
            that they play on radio

holly turns back to the band who are still in full swing
the camera moves down the body of the lead singer singing
into a microphone from his longish curly red hair through
his cutoff red shirt and sweaty torso to his guitar  he
wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold
bracelets on his upper arm  the microphone screeches
feedback

                         the 39 steps
                   singing
            im gonna dance at clubs
            gonna do just what im told
            because im bleedin now
            and im bleedin now
            i wanna slip slip slip slip
            slip
            into the crowd
            i wanna slip slip slip slip
            slip
            into the crowd

the camera moves back to holly and the even more stricken
looking mickey  they are crowded in with people  in the
background a waitress holds up a tray  a man drinks from a
glass mug people chatter indistinctly over the loud band
the club is noisy smoky and thick with people  holly
glances at mickey once again this time unable to contain
her annoyance

                         holly
            oh why are you making those faces

                         mickey
                   leaning over to
                   holly gesturing

                   interrupting
                   gesturing to the
                   offscreen band
            listen you are witnessing genius!

                         mickey
                   pointing to his ears

            meltdown!  i cant hear anything

                         holly
                   overlapping
                   gesturing dramatically
            look cant you feel the energy
            its tangible energy!  the rooms
            alive with positive vibrations!

she opens a vial of cocaine

                         mickey

holly holds a short metal straw of cocaine to her nose and
sniffs it

                         the 39 steps
                   singing in the
                   background while
                   holly and mickey talk

                         mickey

while mickey pleads with her holly puts her cocaine vial
into her purse  she holds a finger against one nostril and
sniffs  she then picks up her lit cigarette and continues
to smoke

                         mickey
            can we can we go

                         holly
                   looking at the
                   offscreen hand
                   bopping her head to
                   the music and smoking
            no!

                         mickey
                   touching his ear in pain
            myuh

the camera leaves the crowded tables and moves back to the

silhouette are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk
arguing  they pass some lighted clothing store windows a
few cars go by in the dark street

int the carlyle club  night

bobby short is playing im in love again on the piano
accompanied by a bass player  an art deco mural fills the
wall behind him

                         bobby short
                   singing
            why am i
            just as reckless as a child
            why am i
            like a racehorse running wild
            why am i
            in a state of ecstasy
            the reason is cause somethings
            happened to me
            im in love again
            and the spring is comin

as the camera leaves the musicians and moves to the
conversatively dressed audience  a far cry from the rock
club atmosphere the carlyle is quiet except for bobby
shorts singing  the audience at their tables watch him
some with smiles of pleasure  a man has his arm around a
woman  jewels sparkle in another womans hair  the men
wear suits

mickey and holly sit at one of the tables a candle burns in
its holder on the tabletop  holly takes a cigarette from
her purse as she holds her hand to her nose sniffing
mickey keeps shooting glances at holly she cant sit still
bobby short continues to sing

                         bobby short
                   singing
            im in love again
            hear my heart strings strummin
            im in love again
            and the hymn theyre hummin
            is those cuddleup
            huddleup blues
            im in love again
            and i cant rise above it

as holly lights her cigarette dropping her matchbook on
the floor  she bends down to pick it up then starts to
fidget in her chair  she gulps her wine she sniffs
mickey tries to watch the offscreen bobby short he crosses
his arms across his chest

the film cuts back briefly to bobby short playing the piano

                         bobby short
                   singing continuing
            im in love again

                   interrupting
                   glancing at her
                   sister for a moment

a female customer whod come over to the table browsing
through the rack of clothes near hannah looks up reacting

of clothes beneath the table

                         holly
                   shaking her head

                   at the offscreen hannah
            why must i let my insecurities
            spoil everything

holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the
table

her hands clasped in front of her continues to sing her
song  a large group of other hopefuls are seen in the
background behind her

                         holly
                   continuing her
                   singing barely
                   moving her body

priest looks out a simple stainedglass window then turns
to an offscreen mickey

                         father flynn
                   gesturing

            like to convert to catholicism

the camera moves back to reveal mickey his back to the
camera sitting in front of father flynns desk  a lamp is
lit in the background the fathers desk is neat  the room
is comfortably decorated in wood and leather

                         mickey
            well uh because yyou know i
            gotta have something to believe in

                         father flynn
                   pacing behind his
                   desk and gesturing
            i understand  but why did you make
            the decision to choose the catholic
            faith

leather armchair next to a table set for tea  he begins to
pour the tea into china cups

            it means making a very big leap

father flynn clasps his hands in his lap

                         mickey
                   nodding fiddling
                   with his raincoat

the film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in mickeys
parents apartment

in the foreground a section of the living room can be seen
with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo  the
hallway itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf
at the other end of the hallway in the background is
another bureau with candlesticks on top and a framed
picture on the wall above  mickeys mother stands in the
front of this bureau at the hallways end screaming at the
top of her lungs holding her heart dramatically

                         mother
                   crying
            why  oh my god!

she sobs hysterically staggering offscreen to the bathroom
she shuts the door  mickey walks into view in the living
room looking after his shocked mother who continues to cry
over the scene

                         mickey
                   overlapping and gesturing
            i dont understand
                   turning to his
                   offscreen father
            i thought that you would be happy

                         father
                   offscreen
            how can we be happy

his father walks into view carrying a teacup and a candy
dish  he strides past mickey towards the kitchen

                         mickey
                   following his father
            well because i never thought of
            god in my life  now im giving it
            serious thought

                         father
                   offscreen in the kitchen

                   gesturing at the
                   kitchen door to his
                   offscreen father

                         mickey
                   shrugging
            so just cause i was born that
            way you know im old enough to
            make a mature decision

mickeys father walks into view he stands by the stove near
the kitchen doorway picking up a dirty glass and some bowls
to clean

                         father
            but why jesus christ  why for
            instance shouldnt you become a

at his son

            me  look youre getting on in
            years right  arent you afraid of
            dying

mickeys father walks offscreen again to the kitchen sink

                         father
                   offscreen
            why should i be afraid

                         mickey

                         father
                   offscreen

                   gesturing
            that thought doesnt terrify you

mickeys father walks out of the kitchen past his son to
the living room

                         father
                   waving his arm
            who thinks about such nonsense

            be dead

                         mickey

                   father gesturing

            of what  ill be unconscious

                         mickey
                   turning and walking
                   down the hallway
            yeah i know  but never to exist
            again!

                         father

                         mickey
            well it certainly doesnt look
            promising

mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the
hallway  he starts to pound it

                         father
                   offscreen
            who knows whatll be

mickeys father comes back on screen hes carrying a plate
of hors doeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen
he stops and looks down the hall at mickey whos now
struggling to open the bathroom door

                         father
                   gesturing with his
                   hands full
            ill either be unconscious or i
            wont  if not ill deal with it

                         mickey
                   pounding on the door

                         mickey
                   sighing
            but if theres a god then whwhy
            is there so much evil in the world
                   shrugging

mickey reacting hits his forehead

                         father

            how the hell do i know why there
            were nazis  i dont know how the
            can opener works

mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to

a beautiful snowcovered church downtown complete with
courtyard and wroughtiron fence  a pedestrian walks by
with an umbrella  a church choir sings a soaring hymn over
the scene

the music continues as the film moves inside where the
choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold  a
fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film
cuts to the back where mickey his arms crossed stands
underneath some stainedglass windows watching and listening
to the inspiring music

the choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to father
flynn in his office

he picks up some large heavy books from a shelf near his
window and he walks over to mickey whos standing near his
desk already holding several tomes  father flynn puts the
books on top of mickeys pile mickey flipping through the
top one awkwardly carries his bundle to the door

next is seen a closeup of a painting of jesus christ on the
cross complete with crown of thorns and holy expression
his eyes especially designed to blink as the lights hit
them open and close repeatedly  the hymn plays on loudly
as the camera moves back revealing mickey standing outside
a barber shop window looking at the christ playing and
shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes 3d effect
smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger blinking
christ  a barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby
passing traffic is reflected in the window

mickey turns from the window shrugging and starts to walk
down the street past a fruit and vegetable store with open
airdisplayed flowers past several briskly moving
pedestrians

with the hymn still playing the screen goes black briefly
mickey opens the door the light from a hallway illuminating
him  hes just entered his apartment  he closes the door
and walks through his dark foyer he carries a brown bag
he switches on the light and walking past his spiral
staircase past several framed pictures on the wall he
makes his way to his living room coffee table  mickey pulls
a crucifix out of the bag he looks at it then puts it on
the table near a pile of books and some objets dart  he
then takes out a copy of the new testament putting it on
top of the crucifix  then out comes a framed picture of a
saint  it too gets put on the growing pile  but the bag is
not yet empty  next comes a large loaf of wonder bread and
a large jar of hellmans mayonnaise  mickey sets them on
top of the saint

                                            cut to

                        autumn chill

bachs concerto for harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to
the waterfront at dusk  a bench faces some wharf pilings
the water gently laps against them as lee walks into view
the wind blowing her hair  she stands and faces the water
and the distant skyline across the bay  the view is
contemplative beautiful in the dim light

lee is alone her hands are in her pockets  lee thinking
is heard over the scene the harpsichord music plays in the
background

                         lee vo
            the nights are really getting
            cooler  summer went so quickly
            soon itll be fall
                   walking to the beach
                   and sitting down
            my literature professor really
            likes me  it was fun being out
            with him last night
                   staring pensively at
                   the water
            funny  i feel like im betraying
            elliotbut thats ridiculous
            why shouldnt i see doug  elliots
            not free
                   pausing
            just go one step at a time  lets
            see what the next few months bring

the concerto stops and the movie cuts to holly leaning into
an open phone booth near a subway entrance  she wears a
football jacket jeans and sneakers she holds a manuscript
in her arms  its a busy corner  people rush past holly
towards the subway others are walking up the station steps
holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to hannah

                         holly
                   into the telephone

holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette
she looks off in the distance smiling as the film cuts to

int hannahs apartment  thanksgiving  night

its thanksgiving at hannahs once again  guests are
crowded together in the living room surrounding the piano
where evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music
norma stands behind him leaning against a bookladen wall
the guests are chattering enjoying themselves a lamp glows
on the corner of the piano  a little boy sitting in a chair
next to evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is
leaning over the arm of the sofa  an adult guest talks to
the little boy another guest takes a sip of wine from a
glass shed placed on the bookshelf behind her as evan turns
and addresses the group

                         evan
                   gesturing
            now hereheres a song that
            norma sang on that trip we made up
            to the show in buffalo  and oh
            was she beautiful that night!

the guests laugh appreciatively  a woman comes over to evan
and hands him some wine

                         norma
            come on
                   laughing and touching
                   evans shoulder


                         evan
                   overlapping to the woman
            thank you honey
                   putting his drink
                   down on the piano
            oh yes you were dear  dont you
            remember that night
                   gesturing and
                   pushing back some
                   sheet music that was
                   starting to fall
            she was so beautifulshe was so
            beautiful that when men saw her
            walking along the streets theyd
            drive their cars right up on the
            sidewalk

he laughs the guests laugh with him

                         evan
                   looking back at norma
            isnt that right honey eh

                         norma
                   tapping his shoulder
            a slight exaggeration

the guest continue to laugh they are charmed

                         evan
                   overlapping norma laughing
            i know

                         norma
                   gesturing
            but only slight

evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play
the piano  a nearby woman toasts him with her drink  the
camera moves around the room as he plays showing the
various guests chattering over the music  some are in
clusters in private conversations others listen and watch
the offscreen evan  a couple stands by the window one man
gets up from his chair and walks away  some guests sip
their drinks smiling as the camera moves back to the piano
and the bookladen wall  evan is playing the piano with
exuberance  norma still standing behind him has a
poignant wistful expression on her face  she mouths the
words to the song evan is playing it could happen to you
the woman next to her smiles enjoying the music as the
camera continues its exploration moving to a man standing
in the doorway with a group of children  mavis the maid
walks by with a tray of hors doeuvres  the man takes one
mouthing his thanks as the camera travels past the open
bookshelf past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and
munching to reveal lee  she is leaning against another
doorway a faraway look on her face as she listens to the
music  mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway  several
people deep in conversation stand nearby as elliot
holding a drink walks up behind her

                         elliot
                   sipping his drink
            youve been very cold to me tonight

                         lee
                   glancing back at
                   elliot then turning away
            no

                         elliot
            is something wrong

                         lee
                   turning
            oh not here
                   touching elliots arm
            there are too many people around

lee slips past elliot and walks away  elliot looks back at
her briefly then sipping his drink he turns and looks
offscreen at the crowd in the living room

                                            cut to

int hannahs kitchen  night

holly is standing in the pantry preparing some offscreen
food  near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a
glass porthole  in the foreground the kitchen table is
crowded with bowls and plates of food  an open cupboard
separates holly from the rest of the room

                         holly
                   looking offscreen
            hey hannah  you know i think lee
            is really serious about her new
            boyfriend  yeah eh from what i
            understand he sounds really nice

hannah walks into view headed for the refrigerator  she
carries two tomatoes

                         holly
            im so happy for her  i think
            shes in love

hannah opens the refrigerator totally ignoring holly

                         holly
                   reacting
            hey whats the matter

                         hannah
                   taking a bunch of
                   celery out and
                   slamming the
                   refrigerator door
            im real upset about what you wrote

hannah walks over to the table gathering up more food

                         holly
            my script

                         hannah
            its obviously based on elliot and
            me

                         holly
            oh so loosely

                         hannah
                   angrily
            no not oh so loosely!  real
            specifically!  is that how you see
            us

                         holly
                   shrugging walking
                   out of the pantry area
            well

                         hannah
                   interrupting
            can i can i not accept gestures
            and feelings from people  do i do
            i put people off

holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands

                         holly
                   reacting
            well its a madeup story

she dries her hands as hannah her arms laden with
vegetables strides over to her sister

                         hannah
                   yelling
            no its real exact!  thethe
            situations the dialogue everything
            itsits full of intimate details
            between elliot and me!
            which i dont i dont see how you
            could even possibly know about  a
            conversation we once had about
            adoption

hannah storms out a nearby door as holly turns away from the
sink

                         holly
                   gesturing the towel
                   still in her hand as
                   she speaks to her
                   offscreen sister
            well lee mentioned that to me so
            obviously you discussed it with her
            you
                   pacing around the table
            i just took the essence and i blew
            it up into drama

holly wipes her hand on the towel as hannah reenters the
kitchen carrying even more vegetables

                         hannah
            i dont see how lee could know
            about these things  i dont!  i
            dont tell her everything

hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables
down on the counter  holly puts the dishtowel down and
absently straightens some things on the foodladen table

                         holly
                   reacting
            wow i guess i hit a nerve

                         hannah
                   turning to look at holly
            you make it sound like you know i
            have no needs or something  you
            think im too selfsufficient

                         holly
                   stopping her mindless
                   straightening at the
                   table reacting
            now hannah thats not what i
            meant you know
                   walking offscreen to
                   the sink area
            uh yeah everybody relies on you
            for so much youre so giving
            its not a criticism  we love you
            were grateful

                         hannah
                   walking out of the
                   pantry to the food
                   laden table
            youre grateful but you resent me

                         holly
                   offscreen
            oh wow!  i dont want to have this
            conversation  i didnt do anything
            wrong

hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table holly
walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket  she stops
at the corner of the table and faces hannah

                         holly
                   onscreen
            yyou mentioned to me yourself that
            you and elliot were having some
            problems

                         hannah
                   gesturing
            yeah were having some problems
            but problems that are my
            businesswhich i dont see how
            you could know about in such detail
            how does lee know about these
            things  how  theyre private!

hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it as well as her
armload of spices into the pantry area

                         holly
                   turning to look at
                   her sister as she
                   walks past
            well why dont you share them with
            us

                         hannah
                   with her back to the camera
            i donti dont want to bother
            everyone

                         holly
                   facing her sisters back
            thats the point  id like to be
            bothered

                         hannah
                   turning to look at holly
            i dont see how you could know
            about these things unless elliots
            been talking to you

                         holly
                   shaking her head
            no he hasnt  if i offended you
            im sorry

hannah reacting puts the spices down on the pantry counter
holly turns away

the film cuts to the dining room doorway  guests can be
seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet
table in the living room  lee and elliot can be heard
offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across
the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an
intense conversation  the piano as well as soft chatter
is heard in the background

                         lee
                   offscreen
            its over elliot  i dont know
            how to make it any clearer  its
            over  i cant see you anymore

                         elliot
                   offscreen overlapping
            uh
                   onscreen gesturing
            iii know  i deserve this

                         lee
                   touching her chest
            look im just as much at fault

                         elliot
                   overlapping gesturing
            ififif you can believe i have
            such feelings for you!

                         lee

            met someone else  ive met someone
            else

                   away from elliot
            ii told you i wasnt going to
            wait forever

lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            but it hasnt been forever
                   walking over to lee
                   at the justclosed door

                         lee

            first time and youre still married
            to my sister whichi now realize

            much more in love with her than you

                         elliot
                   shaking his head

            would never have let myself be
            drawn in  i was very weak  so
            were you  now ive met someone else

the door opens and mavis appears holding a set of
candlesticks  she walks over to the dining room table
which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece
glassware and china  she puts them down as lee and elliot
stand awkwardly near the door waiting for her to leave

                         lee
                   to mavis
            dinner soon

                         mavis
            about fifteen minutes

                         lee
                   nodding
            uhhuh  good

mavis leaves  both lee and elliot quickly close the door
behind her and immediately pick up where theyd left off

                         elliot
            and youre in love overnight

                         lee

                         elliot
                   trying to put his

            lee

                         lee
                   pulling back
                   flinging her hands
            ah its over!  elliot i mean it
            its over!

they look at each other reacting as the film cuts back to
hannahs kitchen  normas face can be seen in the porthole
window on the other side of the pantrys swinging door  she
looks around the kitchen then opens the door and steps
inside  holly stands nearby working in the pantry area

                         norma
                   holding the door
                   half in and half out
                   of the kitchen
            sweetheart i loved your script  i
            thought it was so clever

                         holly
                   turning to norma
                   smiling and holding
                   a glass of wine
            well youre my mother  not

                   gesturing
            i particularly liked the character
            of the mother  just a boozy old
            flirt with a filthy mouth

holly chuckles

                         norma
            im so proud!

                         holly
            oh mom thanks

norma steps back out of the kitchen the door swinging shut
behind her  holly looks at the door sipping her wine as
the movie cuts back to hannahs living room  a chubby
friendly uncle sits on a sofa one child on his lap and
several others gathered crosslegged around him on the floor

they lean on the coffee table which is covered with glasses
and a bowl of chips  other guests mingle in the background
one couple enters the living room smiling at the scene on
the sofa  mavis crosses the welllit foyer in the background
and opens the door to more guests  the piano plays on

                         uncle
                   raising his bottle
                   of beer to the children
            now heres a toast to thanksgiving
            all right

the children mutter their enthusiastic agreement picking up
their illicit glasses of beer

                         uncle
            are we supposed to have beer
            yeeeah!

the uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids
outstretched glasses  they cry indistinctly with excitement

                         uncle
                   overlapping the
                   childrens squeals of delight
            let me at it!
                   to one of the little boys
            hows that fletcher

laughing he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap he
clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding which
is almost as big as she is

                         uncle
                   to the little girl
            doll  to thanksgiving  heres a
            little toast doll
                   clinking glasses
            come on  bottoms up

the uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the
movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in
hannahs bedroom  her face moves on to the screen

                         hannah
                   to the offscreen elliot
            have you been talking to holly or

hannah walks towards elliot hes in the bathroom standing
over the sink

                         hannah

            something

                         elliot
            no

elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an
offscreen medicine cabinet

                         hannah
                   following elliot and
                   gesturing talking to
                   his back
            well what is it then  what  eh

            alienated you

                         elliot
                   taking a bottle of
                   aspirin from the
                   cabinet and walking
                   back to the sink gesturing
            hannah my head is throbbing
                         hannah
                   gesturing
            you never want to talk about it
            i every time i bring it up you
            you change the subject  what is it
            do you were communicating less
            and less  you sleep with me less
            and less

                         elliot
                   angrily turning to
                   hannah and pointing
                   as she shouts
            hannah i am very mixed up!  now
            please!

elliot turns back to the sink once again obscured by the
partially closed door

                         hannah
                   reacting her voice
                   trembling slightly
                   and gesturing
            do you talk to holly or lee behind
            my back  do you  you must  they
            they seem to know so much about us

                         elliot
                   walking towards a
                   towel rack and gesturing
            well maybe ive asked advice once
            or twice oror made a joke

he dries his hands as hannah standing behind him continues
to talk

                         hannah
                   gesturing
            well what do you do  dododo you
            talk to holly or lee or what  do
            you do you do you phone them

                         elliot
                   whirling around to
                   face hannah snapping
            leave me alone can you!

he closes the door briefly obscuring hannah and himself
from view

                         elliot
                   continuing in a
                   lower tone
            jesus ive told you  i need
            someone i can matter to

the camera moves behind the closed door into the bathroom

                         hannah
                   reacting near tears
            you matter to me  completely

                         elliot
                   pausing his voice
                   rising again
            its hard to be around someone who
            gives so much andand needs so
            little in return!

he opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle
back

                         hannah
                   gesturing pleading
            but lookii have enormous needs

elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut

                         elliot
                   shouting
            well i cant see them and neither
            can lee or holly!

he leaves  hannah watches him go reacting  she is stunned

                                            cut to

int hannahs living room  another night

the dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the
offscreen foyer pictures line the wall  piano music is
still heard very softly in the background as hannah hugging
herself walks slowly down the hallway into the living room
she briefly looks around lost in thought  she sits down
heavily tiredly on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts
to several framed photographs on the mantel  one shows
hannah and elliot on their wedding day  another shows
elliot obscured in the shadows  yet another has captured
norma as a young girl  the camera however moves closer
and closer to a photograph showing hannah lee and holly
the three sisters smiling into the camera  there is no
sound

                                            cut to

int hannahs bedroom  night

the film shows the bedroom night table holding a small
lamp a wooden box a castiron fire truck an ashtray and
glasses  elliots pajamaclad arm moves into view  he
turns off the lamp the room is now pitchblack

                         hannah
                   offscreen
            its so pitchblack tonight  i
            feel lost

                         elliot
                   offscreen
            youre not lost

elliot turns the lamp back on then turns to hannah she is
lying on her side of the bed partially in shadow  he leans
over and kisses her

                         elliot
            i love you so much

they begin to kiss passionately as bewitched starts to
play in the background

                    lucky i ran into you

bewitched continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime
new york city street  mickey his hands in his pockets
walks along the sidewalk one person among many other
pedestrians  he pulls his coat tighter around him as he
walks bewitched continues to play as he passes tower
records neonlit window  he glances insideand sees
holly her jacket flung over her shoulders looking at some
records

mickey walks through the revolving doors of tower records
up a few stairs to the selling floor proper and stops right
in front of holly

                         mickey
                   gesturing
            mmm i dont know if you remember

            you know it came very dangerously
            close to emasculating my nose in
            a
                   touching his nose again

            which is a long dull story and
            i wont get into it  but

mickey walks back onscreen to holly  the two of them are
partially obscured by a large white jazz sign imprinted with
a large red circle as they continue their conversation

                         holly
                   interrupting

they emerge from behind the jazz sign still walking still
talking

                         holly
                   smiling gesturing
            but you have to remember while

holly laughs embarrassed as mickey puts the record hes
been looking at back in the bin

                         mickey

            a sneaking feeling a nagging
            sensation i shouldve kept walking
            and

holly chuckles looking off for a moment

                         mickey
                   continuing looking
                   at holly
            and not begun this conversation

there is a brief pause and the movie cuts to

int mickeys apartment  day

the screen shows a chaise in mickeys apartment an ashtray
on a stand sits nearby  the camera moves down the chaise
past several piles of books to mickeys coffee table  he
sits picking at his fingers and listening on the edge of
the table in front of holly who is sitting crosslegged on
the floor propped up with a pillow reading her script aloud

                         holly
                   offscreen as the
                   camera moves across
                   the room towards her
                   and mickey reading

holly closes the script and looks up at mickey

                         holly
            thats the end

mickey smiles and shrugs not knowing what to say

                         holly

            okay  just you know tell me what

            oh gosh you really think i can
            write

                         mickey
                   gesturing
            i thought it was wonder theres
            maybe one or two things in there
            that i would do differently myself
            but

                   gasping and nodding
            right

                         mickey
                   continuing
            but who cares  it was just

            it was fabulous

                         mickey

                   his head
            fabulous i mean it!  im so
            impressed

holly thrilled with mickeys overwhelming response stands
up her hand on her head

unable to contain herself she begins to walk up and down
the room holding her script  the camera follows her
mickey is now offscreen

                         holly
                   laughing
            oh god!

                         holly
                   grinning looking at
                   the offscreen mickey
            uh gee  would you like to have
            lunch  uh uh

            hear what made you suddenly decide
            to drop out of life

                   pausing grinning
            god you really liked it!

you made me love you starts to play as the movie cuts to
the street outside mickeys apartment house an old building
complete with a red entrance door and a gray weatherbeaten
façade  trees line the sidewalk  holly and mickey emerge
from the door and walk up the street revealing a whole row
of similar apartment buildings  they pass a few other
people as they walk

the film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and
stainedwood café  through the window holly and mickey can
be seen having lunch  holly is talking animatedly mickey
takes a sip of coffee  some people pass by

next the film cuts to an almost isolated path in central
park complete with oldfashioned streetlamps and scattered
leaves  holly and mickey stroll into view deep in
conversation

                         holly
                   gesturing
            gosh you really went through a
            crisis you know that  hhow did
            you get over it  i mean when i
            ran into you you seemed you
            seemed just perfectly fine  well

                         mickey
            well
                   chuckling
            ill tell you
                   sighing
            one day about a month ago

the film abruptly cuts to mickeys flashback a visual
counterpoint to the story he is telling holly  a closeup
of a nervous perspiring and panting mickey alone in his
apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard

                         mickey vo
            i really hit bottom  you know
            i just felt that in a godless
            universe i didnt want to go on
            living  now i happen to own this
            rifle
                   coughing


mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead  he
shuts his eyes tightly

                         mickey vo
            which i loaded believe it or
            not and pressed it to my forehead
            and i remember thinking at the
            time im gonna kill myself  then
            i thoughtwhat if im wrong
            what if there is a god  i mean
            after all nobody really knows that

the camera moves past the desperate mickey to a mirror on
the wall behind him  its reflection shows his spiral
staircase and some standing lamps  a clock faintly ticks

                         mickey vo
            but then i thought no  you know
            maybe is not good enough  i want
            certainty or nothing  and i
            remember very clearly the clock was
            ticking and i was sitting there
            frozen with the gun to my head
            debating whether to shoot

the gun goes off with a loud bang  the mirror shatters

                         mickey vo
            all of a sudden the gun went off

mickey holding the rifle is seen running over to the
shattered mirror  the sounds of his excited neighbors
their shouting a knocking door are heard as he continues
his tale

                         mickey vo
            i had been so tense my finger had
            squeezed the trigger inadvertently

                         neighbor #1
                   offscreen overlapping
            whats happening  whwhwhats
            going on

                         mickey vo
                   continuing
            but i was perspiring so much
            the gun had slid off my forehead
            and missed me

                         neighbor #2
                   offscreen overlapping
            i dont know  i heard a gun  is
            everything all right

mickey still brandishing the rifle runs into his sunlit
living room  he looks around frantically his shirt loose

finally he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the
coffee table  the gun goes off a second time  mickey
standing nearby jumps his hands flying to his head  the
doorbell rings the neighbors begin pounding at the door

                         mickey vo
            and suddenly neighbors were were
            pounding on the door andand i
            dont know the whole scene was
            just pandemonium  and uh you
            know and iiiii ran to the door

mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door

                         mickey vo
            iiii didnt know what to say
            you know i was i was embarrassed
            and confused and mymymy mind was
            rrracing a mile a minute

he returns onscreen panting he looks frantically once
again around the living room

                         mickey vo
            and ii jus knew one thing

the film cuts to a west side street  its an overcast day
mickey walking slowly along the sidewalk passes several
other pedestrians and numerous storefronts including
kleins pharmacy and a barbq take out  occasionally he
is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the
street a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene

                         mickey vo
            iiiii had to get out of that
            house  i had to just get out in
            the fresh air andand clear my head
            and i remember very clearly  i
            walked the streets  i walked and i
            walked  ii didnt know what was
            going through my mind  it all
            seemed so violent and ununreal to
            me  and i wandered

the movie cuts to the exterior of the metro movie theater
with its smoked glass entrance doors and its art deco feel
an old publicity photo hangs inside  mickeys reflection is
seen at the almosttransparent doors as well as the
reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by  his
reflection walks towards the theater entrance he continues
his story

                         mickey vo
            for a long time on the upper
            west side you know anand it must
            have been hours!  you know my my
            feet hurt  my head was was
            pounding and and i had to sit
            down  i went into a movie house
            ii didnt know what was playing or
            anything

mickey walks into the movie house  he is seen through the
glass doors which still reflect the street and traffic
outside  he makes his way through the lobby into the actual
theater

                         mickey vo
            i just i just needed a moment to
            gather my thoughts and and be
            logical and and put the world
            back into rational perspective

the film abruptly cuts to the theaters blackandwhite
screen where the marx brothers in duck soup play the
helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live
xylophone  the sounds of the xylophone are heard as the
movie cuts to the darkened theater where mickey slowly sits
down in a balcony seat  the xylophone music stops and
changes to hideehideehideehideehideehideeho as sung
by the marx brothers and ensemble in the movie  the singing
continues faintly in the background as mickey continues his
tale

                         mickey vo
            and i went upstairs to the balcony
            and i sat down
                   sighing
            and you know the movie was aaa
            film that id seen many times in my
            life since i was a kid anand i
            always uuh loved it  and you
            know im im watching these
            people up on the screen and i
            started getting hooked oon the
            film you know

the film cuts back to the blackandwhite movie screen as
mickey continues to talk  the marx brothers as well as the
hundredodd other cast members in duck soup are kneeling
and bowing as they sing hideehideeho they kick their
heels up in the air  they sway back and forth hands
clasped singing ohhhhhh

                         mickey vo
            and i started to feel how can
            you even think of killing yourself
            i mean isnt it so stupid  i
            mean llook at all the people up
            there on the screen  you know
            theyre real funny and and what
            if the worst is true

the movie cuts back to mickey sitting almost obscured in
the dark theater  the ohhhhhhs coming from the
offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak

                         mickey vo
            what if theres no god and you
            only go around once and thats it
            well you know dont you want to

            all a drag  and im thinking to
            myself geez i should stop ruining
            my life

as mickey talks the film cuts back to the antics of the
marx brothers on the blackandwhite theater screen  the
four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting
their voices indistinct over mickeys narration

                         mickey vo
            searching for answers im never
            gonna get and just enjoy it while
            it lasts  andyou know

                         mickey vo
            after who knows  i mean you
            know maybe there is something
            nobody really knows  i know i

            hang your whole life on but thats
            the best we have  andthen i
            started to sit back and i actually
            began to enjoy myself

as mickey continues the film cuts back to duck soup on the
blackandwhite screen  the marx brothers are sitting on a
judges bench playing banjos and singing with the other
cast members  they jump down from the bench still singing
their voices swell

                         marx brothers & company
            oh freedonia
            oh dont you cry for me
            theyll be coming around the
            mountain

the marx brothers kneel strumming their banjos and the
movie cuts back to central park  the flashback is over
mickey and holly continue their stroll as you made me love
you begins to play in the background  they pass some
people a cluster of buildings that look like castles and
the manhattan skyline as seen through the trees as the
camera moves back farther and farther away from them
showing a beautiful central park frozen in time

                         holly
                   gesturing

int hannahs apartment  thanksgiving  night

a large perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly
fills the screen as the camera moves across the foodladen
table in hannahs kitchen past an electric mixer several
bowls spices tomatoes and parsley to reveal evan walking
through the doorway

                         evan

dimly heard you made me love you continues softly in the
background  mavis passes the table licking some food off
her hand  hannah in the background is busy by the stove

                         evan
                   putting ice into his glass

                   offscreen hannah
            yeah  ill get some ice

lee walks off drying her wet hands in the air  hannah in
a silk dress moves onscreen going to the table and pouring
herself a glass of wine as norma enters the kitchen

                         norma
            hannah can i tell everybody youre
            going to play desdemona

norma walks over to a glassdoored cabinet and takes out a
bottle of gin

                         hannah
                   taking a big sip of
                   her wine
            oh mom its only television
                   beginning to mash
                   some sweet potatoes
                   in a bowl on the table


                         norma
                   gesturing with the bottle

            and to me shakespeare doesnt get
            any greater than othello  you with
            some big black stud!  i love it!

norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her
empty glass as hannah stops her mashing reacting

                         hannah
                   gasping and laughing
            oh mom!

                         evan
                   overlapping reacting
            oh honey!

the movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between
the dining room and the living room  upbeat jazz plays over
the low din of the party  two women stand by the partially
set dining room table chatting and arranging some plates
as elliot strolls into view sipping a drink  he passes the
women and walks through the doorway into the living room
nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way

he enters the living room smiling  it is crowded with
guests hannahs children play in their midst  one of
hannahs boys grabs elliots arm  they playfully spar for
a moment before elliot laughingly shakes him off continuing
on his way into a connecting room  he stops at the doorway
looking at the crowd  the camera shows his point of view
guests stand in clusters enjoying themselves one woman
chats with a little boy another woman carrying a drink
walks over to a group of other guests

the film then cuts back briefly to elliot holding his drink
and looking straight ahead as it shows his point of view
once more  this time he sees a smiling lee and doug
talking animatedly a few guests are seen in the background
elliots voice is heard over a closeup of the couple

                         elliot vo
            oh lee you are something

lee and doug kiss each other  they continue talking

                         elliot vo
            you look very beautiful  marriage
            agrees with you  everything that
            happened between us
                   pausing
            seems more and more hazy

as lee takes a sip of her drink the movie cuts back to
elliot standing in the doorway and still staring straight
ahead  the camera moves in closer to his face as he talks
over the scene

                         elliot vo
            i acted like such a fool  i dont
            know what came over me  that
            complete conviction that i couldnt
            live without you

the film quickly cuts to a brief look at lee and doug still
talking animatedly and smiling  lee gently pushes back
dougs hair

                         elliot vo
            what did i put us both through
            and hannah

the camera moves back to elliot

                         elliot vo
                   continuing
            who as you once said i love
            much more than i realized

after pausing for a moment on elliots face the film cuts
to the foyer where two boys and a girl gather by the door
one boy opens it revealing holly  she joyfully enters the
apartment greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss

                         holly
                   kissing the children
            hi!  how are you!
                   kissing

                   kissing


                         boy #1

                         children
                   overlapping talking
                   at once
            no!

the jazz ends as the record scratches and stops  evans
rendition of isnt it romantic is heard on the piano as
holly shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her
shoulder walks towards the living room  she is stopped by
three gueststwo women one of them wearing glasses and a
manwho are coming out of the room

                         holly
                   smiling

                         female guest #2
                   overlapping hugging holly

                         female guest #2

                         holly
                   hugging the man
            hello

the movie cuts to hannah leaning contentedly against a
doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen
evan play the piano  elliot holding his drink walks over
to her  they look at each other for a beat elliot then
hugs hannah pulling her towards him  she leans her head on
his shoulder fingering his jacket lapel  they look
offscreen together happily intimately at the offscreen
guests as the camera moves across the room past a few
guests to reveal evan sitting at the piano  norma sits at
his side one arm resting on the piano  she holds a drink
and looks off in the distance mouthing the words to isnt
it romantic

the camera then moves to the doorway in the living room
where a man holding a drink enters and joins the happy
crowd  evan can be seen in the background playing his song
a child plays near the coffee table

the camera continues to move past the doorway past a huge
grandfather clock to a second doorway leading to the den
here more guests are gathered a child sits in a small
chair by the sofa  he sips a soda as female guest #2 enters
the room and crouches down next to him smiling  she waves
to him  he waves back as the camera continues to move past
the doorway to reveal holly standing in front of a hallway
mirror fixing her earrings  mavis can be seen in the
background through the doorway into the dining room
lighting the candles on the table  she dims the lights
darkening the room and the hallway where holly stands in a
warm candlelit glow  mavis leaves the dining room and
passes holly

                         holly
                   still fixing her
                   earrings to mavis
            its beautiful

mavis walks off  holly reflected in the mirror begins
fluffing her hair as mickey enters and wraps his arms around
her from behind  the camera stays focused on the mirror
both holly and mickey are now seen in its reflection

                         mickey
                   smacking his lips
            now dont get nervous  its just

                         holly
