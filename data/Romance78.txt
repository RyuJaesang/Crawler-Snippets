          ext park  day


          
          we float down through a serene leafy park to the
          childrens play area there in the sandbox a beautiful
          five year old girl plays among a group of kids

          

                                 gigi vo
                    i have a theory about how this all
                    started

          
          a six year old boy approaches he watches the little
          girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle

          
          and then  out of nowhere  the little boy pushes the

          little girl down

          

                                 little girl
                    why did you do that

          

                                 little boy
                    because you smell like dog poo

          
          some of the other kids snicker at this brilliant one
          liner our little girls face turns red

          

                                 little boy contd
                    youre so stupid just like dog poo!
                    youre made of poo!

          
          and then just to punctuate he jumps on the sandcastle
          smashing it finally our little girl starts to cry

          

          int kitchen  day


          
          our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her mom
          she can only get out one syllable between big wet sobs

          

                                  little girl
                    made sob   of sob   dog sob   poo

          

                                 mom
                    honey do you know why that little boy
                    did those things and said those things

          
          the little girl shakes her head no

          

                                 mom contd
                    because he likes you

          

          freeze frame on our little girls face  trying to

          process this

                    uh  excuse me  but what  the  hell
                    where did that rumor start because moms
                    have been spreading it for years

          

          back to the scene  the mom continues

          

                                 mom
                    that little boy is doing those terrible
                    things because he has a crush on you

          
          we see our little girl take this in like she is just now
          beginning to understand the ways of the world

          

                                 gigi vo
                    do you understand what this means we
                    are all encouraged to believe that if a
                    guy acts like a total jerk  that means
                    he likes you sure thats a lesson that
                    might serve us as five year olds but
                    many of us keep believing this advice
                    well into adulthood

                                 gigi vo
                    then as we get older we carry on this
                    tradition of misreading the signals men
                    send by encouraging our friends to do the
                    same

                    so you think its great that theyre
                    getting married but you never feel like
                    were going against nature or something
                    by not getting married

          

                                   neil
                    no babe

                                 neil contd
                    going against nature is like that cat who
                    started nursing that monkey were just
                    two people who arent married

          
          beth manages a weak smile

          

                                   beth
                    right

          

                                 neil
                    i actually think the odds of having a
                    successful relationship increase by not
                    getting married look at my parents 
                    all marriage got them was thirty two
                    years of misery and joint checking

          

                                 beth
                    yeah i know i get that

          

                                 neil
                    like ive always told you  i love you

                    caller id was the worst thing thats ever
                    happened to me total invasion of my
                    personal freedom when a guy doesnt
                    call me it is my right  my duty even 
                    to call him and hang up several thousand
                    times or at least until his mother
                    shouts at me in albanian and blows a
                    police whistle into the phone i mean
                    calling and hanging up is an age old
                    expression of love and frustration and
                    too many wine coolers  and who is at&

          gigi hurriedly hangs up and heads out the door

          

          int red maple  night


          
          a crowded sceney restaurant/bar  with a giant red
          japanese maple growing behind the bar thus the name

          
          we follow a thin black clad hostess as we wind through
          the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to

          

          int red maple  kitchen  same


          
          a busy kitchen   off the kitchen a door leads to

          

          int red maple  office  same


          
          alex sits at a small cluttered desk rifling through
          some papers then from the doorway

          int red maple  later


          
          in the back doorway leading to the alley alex stands
          chatting with tyrone 18 a busboy who smokes a
          cigarette he holds just outside the doorway

          
          kelli ann approaches trying to squeeze through and

          accidentally on purpose shoulder blocks alex hard
          he has to take a step to catch his balance

          
          he turns around to see what happened but kelli ann keeps
          walking eyes front he and tyrone share a look

          

                                   tyrone

          tyrone laughs as alex shakes his head not happy

          

          int red maple  hostess stand


          
          gigi enters slowly looking around searching for conor

          
          she tries to move toward the bar as shes met by kelli
          ann who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile

          

                                 kelli ann
                    are you joining us for dinner or

          gigi continues to scan the place not paying attention

          

                                 gigi
                    im meeting someone

          gigi finishes her visual tour of the room  no conor

          gigi walks off    kelli ann takes her place behind the
          hostess stand

          

          at the bar

          
          gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door     alex
          now behind the bar approaches

          

                                    alex

          alex takes her in       shes clearly nervous

          

                                      alex

                                    gigi
                       see when i said meeting someone i guess
                       that was kind of a broad term kind of a
                       wide interpretation of the word meeting

          

                                    alex
                       because i could just call him 

          
          alex reaches for the phone

                    mean i actually was just  in the area 
                    so i figured id just swing by and see if
                    he was around  because  uhhh 

          
          alex waits looking at gigi amused    she is panicking

          

                                 gigi contd
                    i uhh had to return his 

          
          gigi frantically searches her coat pockets  searching
          for something anything  and finally fishes out a pen
          she looks at it  and decides to go with it

          

                                 gigi contd
                    pen i had to return this  pen he
                    left this so i thought i should really
                    return it before he  you know 
                           conspiratorially to alex
                     freaks out

          
          alex looks at her skeptically   and then takes the pen
          and inspects it

          

                                 alex
                    dr frankel  adult child and geriatric

                    look im not gonna judge about what may
                    or may not be important to someone

          

                                 alex
                    thats not even his dentist

                    my dad

          
          gigi looks at alex for a long moment and finally folds

          

                                 gigi

          gigi struggles to get out quickly alex looks at her 
          holding her pen looking quite frazzled  and softens

                    lemme buy you a drink

          
          gigi smiles and sits back down

          

          int red maple  night


          
          its late the bar is nearly empty alex is totaling
          receipts  and gigi is still nursing a drink

          

                                 alex
                    look you seem like a cool girl so im
                    just gonna be honest  conor is never
                    going to call you

          

                                 gigi
                    oh really how do you know

          

                                 alex
                    because im a guy   its how we do it

          

                                 gigi

                           hopeful
                    he said it was nice meeting me

          

                                 alex
                    i dont care if he said you were his
                    favorite female since his mommy and
                    joanie cunningham over a week went by 
                    and he didnt call

          

                                 gigi
                    but maybe he called me and i didnt get
                    the message or maybe he lost my number
                    or was out of town or was hit by a cab
                    or his grandma died

          

                                 alex
                    or maybe he just didnt call because he
                    has no interest in seeing you again

          

                                 gigi
                    yeah but my friend terri once went out
                    with this guy who never called and she
                    totally wrote him off  then like a year
                    later she ran into him 

          

                                 alex
                    your friend terris an idiot   and shes

                                 alex
                    youre not youre the rule and the
                    rule is  if a guy doesnt call you he
                    doesnt want to call you

          

                                    gigi

                                 alex
                    yeah always i know what blowing off a
                    woman looks like i do it early and i do
                    it often trust me  if a guy is
                    treating you like he doesnt give a shit 
                     he doesnt no exceptions

                    i think i figured it out remember when
                    i went out with that notary public and
                    he cheated on me and then anastasia
                    from upstairs told us that story about
                    how her boyfriend cheated on her at the
                    beginning  but then he totally changed
                    and theyre married and crazy in love

          

                                 beth
                    i thought that guy was a process server

          

                                 gigi
                    no notary anyway the point is 
                    anastasia is the exception not the
                    rule we have to stop listening to these
                    stories  because the rule is that most
                    guys who cheat on you up front dont
                    really care about you very much

                    in his storage space he only used me
                    for rides yet i continued to stalk him
                    for most of 1998 then there was don
                    who broke up with me every friday so he

                    about how things might work out with
                    these dipshits because they knew someone
                    who knew someone who dated a dipshit just
                    like mine and that girl ended up getting

                    ok so let me see if i understand what
                    youre saying is that when people tell me
                    about some girl they know who dated a guy
                    for thirteen years and then he finally
                    married her  thats the exception and
                    the rule is that guys  like neil  who
                    are with girls  like me  for seven
                    years without getting married  are never
                    getting married

                    i was with damon for six years he asked
                    me to marry him on the phone because
                    hes just so different and cool like
                    that said hed eventually get me a
                    ring which he didnt but he did buy
                    himself a ring because isnt that so
                    hilarious and cool that the guy is
                    wearing the ring then my favorite part
                    is i stayed with him even after he took
                    back his proposal and introduced the
                    idea of a relation vacation isnt
                    that a cute name let me explain the
                    concept it involves dating a girl from
                    the time shes thirty two to the time
                    shes thirty nine possibly robbing her
                    of the ability to bear children and
                    then after all that wanting to take a
                    year off and giving it a fun name that
                    you can put on tshirts

                    i guess the trick is how to spot this
                    girl early  so you dont waste the one
                    to seven weeks waiting to find out that
                    its never gonna happen so ive got
                    some signs about how to spot this girl 
                    gleaned from my own experience of
                    course a girl will never sleep with you
                    if she calls you cuddly or dependable
                    she pops a zit in front of you her name
                    is amber or christine she takes a dump
                    in your bathroom or she takes home
                    leftovers in dates 13 i know its not
                    scientific  but im just saying  you
                    were warned

                    you cannot tell from a cursory glance
                    that hes not interested

          

                                 alex

                                 alex
                    guys invented the spark so they could
                    not call and treat you kind of bad and
                    keep you guessing and then convince you
                    that the anxiety and fear that it creates
                    in you is actually a spark and you
                    all buy it you love it you all thrive
                    on it because you all love drama

          

                                  gigi
                    i dont

          

                                 alex
                    really so you dont wait until the last
                    minute on deadlines or on phone bills
                    because you love the drama of not knowing
                    whether youll make it

          
          shes busted

          

                                  gigi

                                 alex
                    and let me guess  when you were stalking
                    conor that night  were you obsessing
                    about him calling for days even though
                    the date was just kind of mediocre

          

                                  gigi
                    ok   yeah

          

                                 alex
                    see you thrive on drama you gotta be
                    more like me  if a girl likes me great
                    if not there are plenty more like her 
                    probably with smaller pores and bigger
                    implants

                    i didnt really hear it in the inflection

                                 janine contd
                    what i mean is we had a contract which
                    is like making promises to each other
                    right

          

                                 javier

          the cabinetry conor comes into to frame wearing a
          toned down version of his gay friendly clothes

                    whatever none of its working ive
                    had a guy leave a voicemail for me at
                    work and then i call him back at home
                    and he emails me to my blackberry and
                    then i text him to his cell and then he
                    emails me to my home account from the
                    plane phone  and it just totally gets
                    out of hand i miss the days where you
                    had one phone number with one answering
                    machine that housed one cassette tape and
                    either the cassette tape had a message
                    from the guy or it didnt thats it
                    now you have to go around checking all
                    your portals and get rejected by seven
                    different technologies its exhausting

                                 gigi
                    at first they were small  like when i
                    first called he said good to hear from
                    you

                                 janine
                    a guy does not leave a woman  to talk to
                    another woman  unless theres something
                    going on

                    bill character  and the two of us
                    basically have a date and then he calls
                    me to invite me to a party at his place

          close on two seemingly identical planks of wood we
          pull back to reveal ben and janine in the wide aisle of
          home depot as janine really studies the two pieces of
          wood finally she points to one of them

          

                                    janine
                      that one

                                   ben

          through the crowd shes deftly holding six drinks
          passing them off to various people as she walks

                                 gigi

                           softly

          alex doesnt even hear her

          

                                 alex
                    why do women do this why do they build
                    this stuff up in their minds take each
                    little thing a guy does and twist it into
                    something else 

          
          gigi stands there embarrassed taking alexs berating

          

                                 gigi
                    id rather be like that  than like you

          

                                 alex
                    excuse me

          

                                 gigi
                    maybe i dissect each little thing and
                    put myself out there too much and maybe
                    i even thrive on the drama of it all
                    but at least that means i still care
                    you think youve won because women are
                    expendable to you sure you dont get
                    hurt or make an ass of yourself that way
                    but you dont fall in love that way
                    either you havent won alex youre
                    alone

                    secretary when i came home early from the
                    maldives so unoriginal it made me feel
                    sorry for him my second husband was a
                    pinch more creative cheated on me with
                    my sister  but made me believe that i
                    was insane for being suspicious at last

                    my sisters two year old eventually gave

                    gem a veritable master at covering his
                    tracks i poured over his phone records
                    intercepted his credit card bills had
                    him followed on countless occasions  and
                    never found a single shred of evidence
                    it wasnt until he died that i found out
                    about the property he owned with his

          anna smiles at the compliment she starts to work on his
          shirt when someone tries to open the locked door

          ben frantically puts his hands over annas mouth then
          working with speed and precision he gathers all of
          annas things and shoves her  naked  into the closet
          there isnt enough room to stand so she has to sit she
          looks up at ben he closes the closet door

          
          he goes to the door of the office

           immobile her face tightens her eyes well up

          

                                  janine

                     you lying sack of shit!

          
            as she grabs two armfuls of his clothes off the racks
           and flies out of the closet

          
           staircase  she hurtles down the stairs throwing armfuls
           of clothes into the foyer then she surveys the scene
           and not satisfied rushes back up the stairs

          
           hallway  as she flies back into the bedroom she sees
           herself in the antique mirror hanging in the hallway

          
           without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and
           smashes it on the ground she stands over it breathing
           heavily looking at the shattered glass

          
           she exits frame and we hear her walk down the stairs the
           camera holding on the empty wall

          
           after a beat we hear her walking back up the stairs  she
           enters frame again holding a dustpan and broom she
           kneels over and begins sweeping up her mess

           beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets and then
           she feels something her face registers curiosity as she
           pulls out  a black velvet ring box beth looks at it
           and when she looks up  neils down on one knee

           revealing an engagement ring

           for a long moment and then

                     never try to trim your own bangs

           is a tiny wedding about six guests and neil waiting
           for beth at the altar

           from the outside looking in a ground floor window  we
           can see the living room of the lower apartment boxes
           fill the room  clearly a new tenant moving in

          
           janine enters carrying two boxes she opens one and
           pulls out the antique mirror now with new glass

                     and ultimately were not taught the one
                     thing that could save ourselves our
                     friends our families countless hours of
                     confusion despair and speculation

          
           she hangs the mirror straightening it slightly she
           steps back seems pleased then in front of camera walk
           two people  the camera follows them down the sidewalk

          
           we see its anna walking with a new guy  its clear
           its a first date they stop at the corner exchange an
           awkward hug as they turn to go their separate ways 

          

                                  new guy
                     it was nice meeting you

          
           anna smiles  the new guy turns and heads off anna
           watches him go and then turns and walks away from us

                     moving on

           front of her
