            as police come inover bodies and blood and guns and up
            the stairs and out a broken window to the crowds in the
            street held back by police past flashing lights and
            emergency vehicles 

            to where life goes on in new orleans

                                                           dip to black

            on bud as he leads lucian through the bowels of city lockup 

            lucian  in prison garbs haggard dark bruises  looks up as
            they pass a twoway mirror of an interrogation room sees

            kiersey

            seated making statements to shepard who is taking notes
            stacks of jesses reports surround them

            bud walks lucian past into

            int interrogation room #2

            and lucian sits at a table bud across from him silence
            hangs several moments 

            on bud                                                             

            starting again knowing theres something bigger a slow
            smile spreads
