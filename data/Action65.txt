int tes study  day

yu and de lu approach the study

				de lu
		sir te said to leave the sword in

de lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside  the woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls

				de lu
		who are you

				jen
		im your guest today  i am governor
		yus daughter

				de lu
		this is sir tes study  you are
		here to

				jen
		i was looking for a quiet corner

				de lu
		i am sir tes head servant  and
		this is another of our guests

int tes study  day

yu gently lays the sword still in its sheath in jens hands

				jen
		its heavy for such a thin piece of
		metal!

				yu
		the handle is heavy  and the blade
		is no ordinary metal  still the
		sword is the lightest of weapons
		youre just not used to handling it

				jen
		but i have had much practice  as a
		child in the west a platoon lived
		with us  theyd let me play with
		their weapons  the scabbard is so
		beautiful

				yu
		beautiful but dangerous  once you
		see it tainted with blood its
		beauty is hard to admire  its 400
		years old

				jen
		exquisite!  you said it belongs to

				yu
		my friend li mu bai  hes given it
		to sir te as a gift

				jen
		li mu bai!  the famous warrior
		why would he give his sword to sir
		te

				yu
		youre too young to understand

				jen
		youre a sword fighter too

yu yanks the sword out of the sheath  an eerie sound
resonates within the study  jen is even more impressed

				yu
		yes i am  but i prefer the
		machete  certain moves however
		call for a sword

				jen
		really

yu puts the sword back in the case

				jen
			longingly
		it must be exciting to be a fighter
		to be totally free!

				yu
		fighters have rules too friendship
		trust integrity without rules
		we wouldnt survive for long

				jen
		ive read all about people like you
		roaming wild beating up anyone who
		gets in your way!

				yu
		writers wouldnt sell many books if
		they told how it really is

				jen
		but youre just like the characters
		in the stories

				yu
		sure  no place to bathe for days
		sleeping in fleainfested beds
		they tell you all about that in
		those books

				jen
		you know what i mean  im getting
		married soon but i havent lived
		the life i want

				yu
		so i heard  congratulations  its
		the most important step in a
		womans life isnt it

				jen
		youre not married are you

				yu
		what do you think

				jen
		no!  you couldnt roam around
		freely if you were

				yu
		youre probably right

yu studies jen  the room falls silent for a moment

ext side court yard  day

its dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple  jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid  she turns to yu
for a final goodbye  yu seems intrigued by the encounter

ext sir tes compound  night

two lighted lanterns are raised up

int tes study  night

sir te hands the sword to governor yu

				sir te
		go ahead governor yu

governor yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword  he closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword
te snubs out the flame from a candle then slides the sword
out from its sheath  the sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark

				sir te
		two feet 9 inches long  1 inch
		wide  the handle is 1 inch deep
		26 inches wide  seventenths of
		an inch thick  with seven rubies
		missing from the hilt  you can
		tell the design dates back to
		before the chin era  engraved with
		a technique lost by the time of the
		han dynasty

				governor yu
		your knowledge is remarkable sir te

				sir te
		a sword by itself rules nothing
		it comes alive only through skillful
		manipulation

				governor yu
		i see your point  please continue

				sir te
		the imperial court isnt the
		problem  with royalty and officials
		everywhere the royal guard keeps
		security tight  but peking is not
		like the west  here youll find
		all sorts of characters  proceed
		with caution in your quest for law
		and order  dont depend only on
		the court  contacts in the giang
		hu underworld can ensure your
		position  be strong yet supple
		this is the way to rule

int jens room  night

a maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for jen then
walks over to jen and helps remove her earrings  someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door

				maid
		governess

				governess

ext yellow hill  night

tsai bo and may wait under an ancient tree  bo stifles a
yawn

				bo
		the fox doesnt care much for
		punctuality  still no sign of her

an old lady struggles up the hill wearing a floppy hat over
her face holding a cane  the three exchange glances

				tsai
		enough!  show yourself

the old woman shrinks in fear but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself  the governess

				fox
		tsai you dog!  you will pay for
		your stubbornness

				bo
		thats what you think old witch!

				tsai
		if you surrender now youll suffer
		less  but if you resist i wont
		stop until youre dead

				may
		father!  let me avenge my mothers
		death

				fox
		youll soon end up like her you
		little whore!

				bo
		youll pay for that!

a fierce battle begins the main fighting between tsai and
fox with may and bo getting a stab in occasionally when
the opportunity presents itself

				tsai
			to bo
		shes going to paralyze you!

using acupressure fox disables bo  may shoots an arrow at
her but she catches it and flings it back hitting may

				tsai
		may!

fox then disables tsai but just as she goes for the kill
li mu bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them

				fox
		tsai you filthy mongrel!  an ambush!

				may
		father are you all right

li addresses fox

				li
		wudan should have gotten rid of you
		long ago  its been a long time
		jade fox!  you dont remember me
		but you should remember my master
		you infiltrated wudan while i was
		away  you stole our master!  now
		its time for you to pay!

				fox
		your master underestimated us women
		sure hed sleep with me but he
		would never teach me  he deserved
		to die by a womans hand!

				li
		you stole the secrets of wudans
		highest martial arts  but after
		ten years of training your moves
		are still undisciplined  and
		today under a wudan sword you
		will die!

li easily brings fox to the ground

li raises his sword to the prostrate fox  a figure masked
in black appears next to fox sword extended saving her

				fox
		disciple well kill them all!

				figure in black
		lets go!

				bo
		another one!

				fox
		i must get rid of tsai!

fox fights tsai bo and may as li addresses the masked
figure

jen becomes visibly upset

				jen
		you say she killed a policeman

				yu
		yes from the west  he went
		undercover and and followed her
		here

				madam yu
		maybe the murderer and the thief
		are one and the same

				yu
		i doubt it  this thief it very
		unusual

as yu speaks she lifts the tea pot to pour jen some tea
as she finishes speaking she looks into jens face and the
pot slips from her hand  without even looking down jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightningfast move

				yu
		and most likely smarter than a

ext te compound  night

a still dark night

ext tes study  night

something moves in the moonlight  a hooded figure jumps down

li mu bai who had been hiding in the shadows comes forward

				li
		isnt it a bit too late to be out
		youve brought me the sword

				figure
		i do as i please

the masked figure lunges away but li mu bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her

				li
		wheres your master

				figure
		whats it to you

the figure floats away  li chases after her

ext peking street  night

the two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops
displaying amazing floating skills

int abandoned monastery  night

the figure bounces into an old monastery  li is already
there

				li
		had enough flying  youve got
		potential  youve studied the
		wudan manual but you dont
		understand it  you need a real
		master

the figure doesnt respond but we sense the pride in her
eyes

				figure
		do you think you are a real master

				li
		like most things i am nothing
		its the same for this sword  all
		of it is simply a state of mind

				figure
		stop talking like a monk!  just
		fight!

				li
		then tell me where jade fox is

				figure
		on guard!

				li
		real sharpness comes without effort

ext monastery  night

the figure leaps into the garden but again li is ahead of
her

the figure attacks li who uses his agility to evade her
frustrated the figure intensifies her attack

the figure losing composure attacks wildly  li gets even
more elusive using a branch to repel her

				li
		no growth without assistant  no
		action without reaction  no desire
		without restraint  now give
		yourself up and find yourself again
		there is a lesson for you

li now holds the stick to her mask gently raising it
slightly

				figure
		go ahead

				li
		why should i  you need practice
		i can teach you to fight with the
		green destiny but first you must
		learn to hold it in stillness

				figure
		why do you want to teach me

				li
		ive always wanted a disciple
		worthy of wudans secrets

				figure
		and if i use them to kill you

				li
		thats a risk im willing to take
		deep down youre good  even jade
		fox couldnt corrupt you

the figures eyes cloud with tears

				figure
		wudan is a whorehouse!  keep your
		lessons!

the figure swirls and takes off leaving a rueful li standing
alone in the monastery

int jens room  night

jen slips in through the window  she pulls off her mask as
she spots the governess/fox sitting and sewing

				fox
		youre home late or should i say
		early

				jen
		why are you still here  you killed
		a policeman  you should leave!
		youll bring ruin on my whole family

				fox
		they wouldnt have found me if you
		hadnt stolen the sword  like a
		little girl you thought stealing
		would be fun  you too are
		responsible for that death  come
		with me  you dont want to waste
		your life as the wife of some
		bureaucrat  denied your talent
		as a master and disciple we will
		rule

				jen
		ill never live as a thief!

				fox
		youre already a thief

				jen
		that was just for fun  how can i
		leave  where would i go

				fox
		wherever we want  well get rid of
		anyone in our way  even your father

				jen
		shut up!

				fox
		its the giang hu fighter
		lifestyle kill or be killed
		exciting isnt it

				jen
		i owe you nothing

				fox
		yes you do!  you are still my
		disciple

jen lunges at the governess and the two exchange a few
blows  jen presses her finger against one of the governesss
pressure points disabling her  jen pushes her across the
room

				jen
		you think youve been teaching me
		all these years from the manual
		you couldnt even decipher the
		symbols!

				fox
		i studied the diagrams  but you
		hid the details!

				jen
		you wouldnt have understood even
		if i had tried to explain  you
		know youve gone as far as you
		can go  i hid my skills so as not
		to hurt you

				fox
		if i hadnt seen you fight with li
		mu bai id still be ignorant of
		all youve hidden from me

				jen
		master i started learning from
		you in secret when i was 10  you
		enchanted me with the world of
		giang hu  but once i realized i
		could surpass you i became so
		frightened!  everything fell apart
		i had no one to guide me no one to
		learn from

				fox
		believe me ive a lesson or two
		left to teach you!

fox exits

ext governor yus gate  day

the governess leaves a small sack over her back

ext tes courtyard  day

li practices fluently with green destiny in hand beautifully
at ease with the weapon  he spins around to find yu standing
in the doorway

				yu
		the sword is back are you happy

li smiles

				li
		i admit getting it back makes me
		realize how much id missed it

				yu
		but its not your sword anymore
		you gave it to sir te

				li
		true  but i must borrow it for one
		last mission  jade fox must die at
		its edge  did you know what you
		were hiding when you covered for
		that girl

				yu
		my job was to get the sword back
		without embarassing anyone  i
		wasnt about to ruin her life or
		her fathers

				li
		you did your job well  but this
		girl i saw her last night

				yu
		i knew she would intrigue you

				li
		she needs direction and training

				yu
		shes an aristocrats daughter
		shes not one of us  in any case
		it will all be over soon  youll
		kill fox and shell marry

				li
		thats not for her  she should
		come to wudan and become a disciple

				yu
		but wudan does not accept women

				li
		for her they might make an
		exception  if not im afraid
		shell become a poisoned dragon

				yu
		its not our affair  even if wudan
		accepts her her husband might
		object

				li
		i thought by giving away the sword
		i could escape the giang hu world
		but the cycle of bloodshed continues

				yu
		i wish there were something more i
		could do to help you

				li
		just be patient with me shu lien

int jens room  night

lo opens the window and sneaks in  right into the point of
jens waiting sword

jens sword drops to the ground

				jen
		lo

				lo

lo grabs her by the wrist

flashback four years earlier

int/ext carriage/mongolian desert  day

jen holds up a comb with daylight shining through it  jen
admires the piece her most prized possession

madam yu sits opposite her

				madam yu
		jen stop playing with it

jen looks out over the desert as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens

				jen
		i wont break it

ext carriage/mongolian desert  day

lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan

				guard a
		its dark cloud!  dark cloud is
		coming!

his warning is useless  from jens pov we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords

				madam yu
		lower the shade dont let them see
		you!

				dark cloud lo
		dont touch the women!

though unharmed madam yu immediately faints  lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from jens hand

she bolts from the carriage and once outside bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard whose horse
flails beside him

she looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback

				lo
		lets go!

ext desert  day

jen and lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed

				lo
		come get your comb

she tries to jab him with the lance but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse

				lo
		hurry back to your mother

lo rides on as she charges after her horse

ext desert bluff  day

a group of bandits is dividing up the loot as jen rides up
keeping a respectable distance  they notice her and rise as
she dismounts

one of them saunters over to her and stands grinning a few
feet away

in a second shes slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face  he crumples to the sand

the other bandits stop laughing quickly exchange glances
and charge her at once

in a matter of seconds theyre either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back

lo calls out and stops the fight

				lo
		shes mine

ext desert  day

lo and jen ride if not sidebyside then parallel about
20 feet apart  their pace has slowed considerably  in
fact theyre dead tired

				lo
		lets stop a moment

				jen
		give it back!

				lo
			shouting a bit
		youre tired  you need rest  your
		horse needs water  theres a creek
		up here

he dismounts looks down at the dry creek bed

				lo
		well there used to be!  whats
		your name  im lo  the hans call
		me dark cloud  im not that tall
		or big but im quick as lightning

				jen
		my comb!

she kicks him  they fight ferociously until lo exhausted
collapses  she kicks him a few times then collapses too

int cave  day

jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur  she sits up with a start and checks her clothes
looking around she realizes shes in a cave  next to her
are a lamp some hunting equipment and a neat row of sharp
arrows  she quickly grabs one of the arrows

				lo
		if you like that arrow i can make
		you a bow  great for hunting wild
		chicken  theyre delicious

jen raises one of the arrows going on the attack again but
her legs betray her and she falls

				lo
		you need to eat understand  then
		youll have the strength to fight
		understand

he helps her up then pours her some horse milk from a sac
he hands her a small chunk of food which she first accepts
grudgingly then her hunger getting the better of her she
starts to wolf it down

				lo
		youre eating too fast  slowly

ext cave  day

lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape  a chicken
roasts over a fire  lo whistles

jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head
lo passes out as jen scurries away

ext mountainside and desert  day

jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered
but soon she passes out

int cave  night

jen again awakes inside the cave  lo tries to feed her some
water but she chokes and tries to push him away only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up

				lo
		youve got quite a temper  its
		better this way

				jen
		you coward!

				lo
		still in a bad mood  at least
		youre speaking  whats your name

jen spits at lo

				lo
		i didnt think the hans had names
		like that

later she weaves in and out of consciousness  in the
flickering lights she sees lo sharpening his arrows

later he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom  a waterfilled cavity serves as a tub

he rises as jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body  he comes over and unties her

				lo
		relax  if i had wanted to i would
		already have done it  you must be
		dying for a bath  fresh waters
		hard to get here  but i managed to
		bring some up  you can wear my
		clothes when youre done  theyre
		clean  dont worry  ill sing so
		youll know where i am  after the
		bath youll be calmer

jen nods and the bandit releases her  he starts to sing as
he walks out  jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit
while she bathes she listens to his singing a loud
rendition of a tribal song  lo apparently doesnt remember
all the lyrics and lalas his way through more than a few
passages  jen smiles

int cave  night

jen grimaces as lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet

				lo
		no more hitting on the head!  all
		this trouble for a comb

				jen
		its mine  it means a lot to me
		a barbarian like you wouldnt
		understand

				lo
		not true  i can use it to pick
		fleas from my horse

				jen
		by the way im a real manchurian

				lo
		im sorry i guessed wrong  i
		though you were a han

				jen
		give me back my comb

				lo
		i dont take orders from anyone

				jen
		give it back

jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs lo drawing a
little blood from his chest  furious lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly  finally lo gets on top of jen and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay  violence turns
into unleashed passion

ext desert oasis  day

lo and jen ride across the desert  jen holds tightly to him

ext cave  night

lo and jen lie in the bath together

				lo
		when i was a boy one night i saw
		a thousand shooting stars  i
		thought where did they all go
		im an orphan  i used to look for
		stars alone  i thought if i rode
		to the other end of the desert id
		find them  ive been riding in the
		desert ever since

				jen
		and so the little boy became a
		fearsome bandit  he couldnt find
		the stars so he stole my comb

lo pauses

				lo
		out here you always fight for
		survival  you have to be part of a
		gang to stand a chance  slowly
		your gang becomes your family  all
		that dark cloud stuff is just to
		scare people and make my life easier

				jen
		so youre still that little boy
		looking for shooting stars

				lo
		i am a man  and now ive found the
		brightest star of all

viewing the desert valley below as jen joins him  they see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance

		for you  theyre still out there
		circling closer

				jen
		let them look

				lo
		it is trouble for me

jen bites her lip

				jen
		dont send me back!

				lo
		you must decide  you might get
		tired of this life  you might
		begin to miss your family  if it
		were our daughter wed look for
		her too  she would miss us  jen
		i want you to be mine forever  i
		will make my mark on the world  i
		will earn your parents respect
		we have a legend  anyone who dares
		to jump from the mountain god will
		grant his wish  long ago a young
		mans parents were ill so he
		jumped  he didnt die  he wasnt
		even hurt  he floated away far
		away never to return  he knew his
		wish had come true  if you believe
		it will happen  the elders say a
		faithful heart makes wishes come
		true

int tent  day

jen and lo kiss  jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm  jen starts to cry  they
embrace

				jen
		keep it safe  return it to me when
		we are together again

				lo
		i will

				jen
			smiling painfully
		if you dont ill come after you
		and i wont let you off so easy

light

he lifts his legs through the window and drops out of

		it was just a cat

the maid pauses then dutifully exits closing the door

jen opens up her palm gasping she sees the comb that lo
has given her

a sensitive pressure point  this provokes a reaction from
the other men

				jen
		what kind of iron arm are you

jen gets up to leave  yu intercepts her

				yu
		put the sword down!

jen jumps out

int yuan courtyard  day

jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing

they raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder

				yu
			calling out
		jen!

jen greets yu with the green destiny

				yu
		everyone out  shut the doors

the men leave

				yu
		fine the friendship is over

yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with jen

yu uses every weapon thats available against jen but none
are any match for the green destiny

after slicing through another set of yus weapons jen looks
admiringly at the green destiny in her hands

				yu
		dont touch it!  thats li mu bais
		sword

				jen
		come and get it if you can

				yu
		without the green destiny you are
		nothing

				jen
		dont be a sore loser  go ahead
		take your pick  ill wait  go
		ahead

yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks  just as the
green destiny slices it in half yu holds the broken blade
at jens neck  she pauses before hurting jen then pulls
back

				yu
		give me the sword

jen taking advantage of yus trust slices her arm

				jen
		take it!

yu her shoulder bleeding falls back as li mu bai jumps in

				li
			enraged
		stop it!  you dont deserve the
		green destiny

				jen
		not another lecture!  on guard!

				li
		lets end this here

				jen
		only the sword will settle this

jen soars up to the rooftop with li right on her tail

ext lake  day

jen floats over the lake li close behind

ext bamboo forest  day

jen runs into a sea of bamboo  she appears to have lost li
but is not slowing down  her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud  the wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by li

the two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges  they glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat  finally jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as li  the two hold their positions for a
while as the bamboo bends

				li
		i only let you go because i wanted
		to see the real you

jen tries to shake li off the bamboo but li recovers nicely

				jen
		what do you know about a true heart

li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree  the bamboo
straightens up and throws jen toward the ground  jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at li

jen chases after li into a clearing out of the bamboo
forest

ext river  day

jen finally catches up to li who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids  jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with li  jen loses her balance

				jen
		what do you want

				li
		what ive always wanted to teach
		you

				jen
		all right  if you can take back
		the sword in three moves ill go
		with you

li takes the sword back

				jen
		give it back!

				li
		kneel!

				jen
		never!

				li
		then you have no use for the sword

li throws the sword into the rapids

jen dives in to retrieve it  he follows jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another  jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning  suddenly jade fox swings into the
rapids and fishes jen out  jade fox carries the unconscious
jen away  li gives chase but loses them

int abandoned factory  day

its raining  inside an old factory fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste  she burns the
needle point causing a blue smoke  she lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near jen who is barely conscious

				fox
		sooner or later theyd drag you
		back to peking  your parents will
		never accept you again  but why go
		home  weve gone this far we
		wont stop now  youll always be
		my lady  at last well be our own
		masters  well be happy  thats
		the most important thing  all we
		have left is each other right
		lie down and rest

jen is too weak to respond

fox leaves jen clutching the green destiny

ext abandoned factory  day

fox scurries ahead in the rain  her eyes catch something
but she keeps moving

int yuan compound  day

aunt wu finishes bandaging yu

				aunt wu
		shes crazy  you should have
		killed her

				yu
		i didnt have the heart

				aunt wu
		well li mu bai can do it

yu senses movement at the window  looking out she sees
jade fox in the distance

int abandoned factory  day

jen wakes up flushed from fever  she takes a sip from a
cup of water  its empty  she tosses the cup gets up
and walks into the rain

ext abandoned factory  day

jen walks out raises her face into the rain and drinks the
raindrops  thirst quenched she turns around and finds li
standing there  jen limps towards him while mumbling

				jen
		is it me or the sword you want

jen falls into li who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes

				li
		youve been drugged!

li carries her inside kicking away the incense burner

int abandoned factory  day

li lays his hands on jens back she slowly comes to

				li
		where is jade fox

jen gestures that she doesnt know  yu and bo enter  yu
looks at jen

				yu
		what happened

				li
		jade fox drugged her  how did you
		get here

				yu
		we followed jade fox

instantaneously a flurry of darts flies directly in jens
direction  li and yu swipe miraculously at them all
sending them flinging hither and thither

fox shows herself  li attacks her  she falls back bleeding
to death

				li
		and so you die

li touches his neck

				fox
		and so shall you!

li pulls a single needle from his neck

				yu
		a poisoned needle!

				fox
		you deserve to die but the life i
		was hoping to take was jens
		ten years i devoted to you  but
		you deceived me!  you hid the
		manuals true meaning  i never
		improved but your progress was
		limitless!  you know what poison is
		an eightyearold girl full of
		deceit  thats poison!  jen!  my
		only family my only enemy

jade fox dies

				yu
		you cant die!  tell us what poison
		you used!  you cant die!  tell us
		the antidote!  you cant let li mu
		bai die!

				jen
		she used purple yin purple yin
		poison  it goes straight to the
		heart

				li
		my blood will soon reverse its flow
		its the same poison she used to
		kill my master  there is no
		antidote

				yu
		that cant be!  everything has an
		antithesis!  why not this

				jen
		the antidote exists  she taught it
		to me  the formula is simple but
		it takes time to prepare  trust me
		as you have helped me let me help
		you

				li
		all right  hurry  i will hold on
		as long as i can

				yu
			takes the comb from
			her hair
		take my horse and go to the compound

				li
		my life is departing  ive only
		one breath left

				yu

				li
		ive already wasted my whole life
		i want to tell you with my last
		breath i have always loved you
		i would rather be a ghost drifting
		by your side as a condemned
		soul than enter heaven without
		you  because of your love i
		will never be a lonely spirit

she kisses him lightly  he closes his eyes

in her hands

gate and sees lo standing there

he runs to her  she greets him

int wu tan temple  magic

int wu tan temple  day

lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him
jen gone

ext wu tan mountain  day

lo catches up to jen who stands on a bridge  the gorges
below are shrouded in clouds  she looks back at him

				jen
		do you remember the legend of the
		young man

				lo
		a faithful heart makes wishes come
		true

				jen
		make a wish lo

lo pauses

				lo
			closing his eyes
		to be back in the desert together
		again

jen smiles turns and leaps into the clouds  they seem to
catch her gently before she disappears into them

lo remains standing a smile on his face tears rolling down
his cheeks

the end
