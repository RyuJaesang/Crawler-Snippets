          tom looks over to where summer sits and realization dawns on
          him
          
          
          int karaoke bar  night
          
          summer is in a back booth with some coworkers when tom walks
          in to the crowded place mckenzie has the microphone and hes
          singing every rose has its thorn by poison hes real into
          it and well its kinda sad tom waves to mckenzie and walks
          over to the booth
          
                              tom
                    hi

          tom is at a loss theres yet another awkward silent beat
          between them thankfully its interrupted by
          
                              mckenzie
                        already drunk
                    goddamn that song is brilliant!
                    whats up hansen
          
          summer sees the next song come up on the screen
          
                                                                  30
          
          
          
                              summer
                    ooh thats me
          
          she downs a shot and jumps up on stage
          
                               summer
                        into mic
                    ok im the new girl so no making
                    fun of me
          
          her coworkers whistle and cheer her on she takes a deep
          breath as the opening bars of born to run begin to play and
          summer starts to sing tom sees summer as the actress in
          whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song its
          something to do with an old convertible the sunset and a
          midget in a tuxedo
          
          later tom sits in the booth with mckenzie doing a shot as
          summer chats with coworkers at another table tom cant help
          but stare at summer she notices and waves he smiles
          hopeful that shell come over she doesnt he hides his
          disappointment
          
          later tom walks back to his table with drinks summer is
          there in midconversation with mckenzie
          
                              tom

                    well you cant go wrong with the
                    boss
          
                              tom
                        sitting down

                    make a person fall in love with a
                    rock is that the love youre
                    talking about

          tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else he
          hides his disappointment the best he can
          
                               tom
                     oh yeah totally friends you and

                     gnight summer
          
          tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go
          the other way
          
                               tom
                         under his breath
                     friends awesome thats just
                     great well done hansen you idiot
          
          tom walks a few more steps
          
          and then seemingly out of nowhere without his even
          noticing summer has wrapped her arms around him and pulled
          him into a kiss!
          
          its unbelievable theres a few seconds where tom isnt sure
          if hes dreaming or not but then he realizes suddenly out
          of the blue his best case scenario really is actually
          happening

          its the greatest morning of all time!
          
          tom walks down the street or more accurately tom struts
          down the street hes pointing at people as he passes
          winking doing a little shuffle he is the man he checks out
          his reflection in a window a young paul newman stares back
          
          people wave as he passes they clap they give him thumbs up
          a parade forms behind him the postman a police officer the
          hot dog vendor ronald mcdonald and mayor mccheese everybody
          loves tom today hall and oates themselves walk with tom
          singing the song
          
          cars stop at crosswalks to let tom go by the drivers also
          pump their fists in celebration of toms achievement last
          night he walks on the man we notice the sidewalk lights up
          every time he touches the pavement like in billie jean
          
          cartoon birds fly onto toms shoulder he smiles and winks at
          them
          
          
          int office  same
          
          tom passes summers office whistling hall and oates she sees
          him and immediately lights up
          
                                 summer
                    hey!

          and theyre all business as tom turns to go however summer
          gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
          anyones day complete tom gives her the international signal
          for ill call you later in return vance sees none of it
          tom walks to his cubicle still on top of the world
          
                                                                  39

                    tell but it was pretty recent and
                    im still kinda thinking about her
          
                              alison
                        disappointed
                    well maybe you should think
                    about someone else who could
                    cheer you up
          
                              tom
                    i cant get her out of my head you
                    know i see her everywhere shes
                    all i think about and its
                    horrible cause i totally didnt
                    see it coming i thought things
                    were fine so now i keep going
                    through every day in my mind every
                    second really wondering what went
                    wrong is it my fault could i have
                    prevented it somehow

                    a lot of people have problems with
                    this but to me it makes both
                    structures so much more beautiful
                    side by side like that
          
          tom keeps talking summer turns and looks directly at the
          camera
          
                                                                  72

                    nod my head and pretend to listen
                    while secretly dreaming about the
                    many ways i can one day rip out
                    your heart and eat it like the

          tom walks by the room marked weddings and anniversaries
          hes about to keep going when he pauses
          
          
          int weddings and anniversaries suite  later
          
          all of the people who work in here are middle aged women
          currently they are standing around one desk where tom sits
          writing everyones cards
          
                                                                   79

                    like everyday that we dont
                    meet is meaningless and
                    incomplete you know spice it up
                    a little
          
          the women clutch their heart like they might faint
          
          
          int religious holidays wing  later

          tears of joy

                    fantastic
          
          suddenly tom sees something at the front of the line
          
                                 tom
                    oh shit

          and here they come toms mom and stepdad sarah and martin
          toms face registers a noticeable panic
          
                                 sarah
                    hey!

          sarah and martin are delighted at this coincidence sarah
          hugs and kisses her son
          
                              tom
                        looking at summer
                    hi mom
          
          summer smiles maybe this will be ok

                    mom martin this is summer

                    much about you! its so good to
                    finally meet you
          
          sarah hugs summer
          
                               summer
                    you too
          
          and now martin weighs in with his own hug tom notices
          summers face growing increasingly concerned why is he
          hugging me
          
                              martin
                        to tom
                    is this the girlfriend
          
          tom is caught like a deer in headlights what can he do
          
                              tom
                    well this is the girl friend ive
                    told you about i dont know if
                    girlfriend is the right word
          
                              sarah
                    you going to see the serial killer

                    great! should we save you seats
          
          again this has become incredibly awkward for tom and for
          summer
          
                              summer
                    absolutely
          
                                                                  82

          when theyre out of earshot tom sees that summer is
          distraught
          
                              tom
                    sorry about that

                    its fine
          
                              tom
                    you wanna go do something else we
                    can totally bolt
          
                              summer
                    did you tell them i was your
                    girlfriend
          
                              tom
                    what! no way i never used that
                    word
          
                              summer
                    they seemed to think i mean why
                    is your stepdad giving me a hug
          
                              tom
                    hes veryloving
          
                              summer
                    does he hug all your friends
          
          theres that word again
          
          summer looks at tom like shes disappointed or even angry at
          him for something then she walks ahead of him into the
          theatre hes forced to follow answerless as conflicted as
          ever why is none of this easy
          
                                                            cut to
          
          
          int movie theatre  later
          
          summer tom sarah martin in a row summers face is cold
          emotionless tom tries to look at her to make eye contact
          something she knows hes looking but it doesnt make her
          head turn his way tom gives up and watches the movie
          
          angle on the movie screen we see a black and white film
          
                                                                  83
          
          
          
          its a man racing down the street fleeing from an unseen
          assassin when he turns around we see the man is tom bullets
          fly and hes hit repeatedly in the back while running away
          like belmondo in breathless he dies an elaborate violent
          horrible onscreen death
          
          
          228
          int club  night
          
          rave music blares tom stands off to the side looking
          miserable summer is on the dance floor though shes not
          really dancing with anyone in particular shes dancing with
          everyone finally she comes over white shirt dripping with
          sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another
          
                              summer
                    youre not having any fun

                    these past few months ive been
                    crazy but ive accepted the fact
                    that she and i were just two very
                    different people who wanted very
                    different things i wanted to get
                    serious shit i loved her and i
                    know now she just isnt the kind
                    of girl who can settle down with
                    one person and be happy the way i
                    wanted and she probably never
                    will there was nothing i could do

                    people should be able to say how
                    they feel how they really feel
                    without some strangers putting
                    words in their mouths the truth a
                    card is a nice thought but it
                    shouldnt do the dirty work for
                    you you love someone tell them
                    yourself in your own words maybe
                    its not love at all maybe theres

          later he uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf
          then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even he
          draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
          something
          
                                                                   104

          tom and summer watching the film tears begin to well in
          summers eyes they soon turn to audible sobs tom turns to
          look at her to offer some sort of comfort believing it to
          be a response to the movie she doesnt look back

          tom drawing a straight line on his wall redecorating
          
                                                                 105
          
          
          
          and then he stops
          
          he looks at the line hes drawn he extends it a little bit
          he draws another he begins to furiously draw on the wall
          from out of nowhere inspiration has hit an image starts to
          form a pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper
          almost shaped like a tear drop

          int record store  night
          
          tom and a much more in control summer walk down the aisles
          he grabs one
          
                               tom
                    it pains me that we live in a world
                    where no ones ever heard of
                    spearmint
          
                              summer

                              tom
                    and its painful oh look
          
          he grabs a ringo starr album and shows it to her just as
          weve seen on page 7 she smiles and they continue on down
          the aisles
          
          in cu tom goes to hold summers hand but something happens
          it could be a total coincidence but just as his hand
          approaches hers in slomo she moves it away and keeps it
          at her side tom puts his hands in his pockets unsure if
          theres something to read in that

                       hey

          do

                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it now
                    hes my husband!
          
                              tom

                               summer
                    what would have happened if i went
                    to the movies instead if i went
                    somewhere else for lunch if i
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later
                    tom it was meant to be just like
                    you said and as it was happening
                    i knew it i could feel it sure as
                    the sun and i kept thinking to
                    myself holy shit tom was right
                    you were right about all of it
                        beat
                    it just wasnt me you were right
                    about
          
          tom is speechless summer takes his hand we may notice her
          wedding ring we may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay we hold it for a
          few seconds more and then the hands separate
          
                              summer
                    anyway i should probably be
                    getting back it was good to see
                    you im glad youre well
          
                                                                 114
          
          
          
          summer gets up and starts walking away from him after a
          second
          
                                 tom
                       summer!
          
          she stops and turns back he takes in her face most likely
          for the last time ever
          
                                 tom

          tom alone in the park getting smaller and farther away every
          second
          
                                                          fade out

                    if tom had learned anything it
                    was that you cant ascribe great
                    cosmic significance to a simple
                    earthly event coincidence thats
                    all anything ever is nothing more
                    than coincidence
