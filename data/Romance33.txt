reporters voice  that recognizable toosmooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have in mathematical terms
bruces version is to the 7th power

          for three decades the kowolski
          family bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown buffalo known for
          their sinfully rich cream filled
          deep fried polski pierogis and
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows today in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary momma
          kowolski and her sons gustov and
          vol decided to do something a
          little bit different tell me
          guys how did this idea come about

                       gustov

          the previous buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet 17 inches baked by
          gladys pelsnick but this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that gustov
          and vol have much more free time
the kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background

dramatically at camera slow zoom in as he speaks

          as we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think what are we

          do you think he would have survived

               wiping his eyes
          kinda bright though

                                                         35



an electrician silhouetted in the bright light descends the
ladder
                    man os
          yeah it is for most people they
          spend their lives in the dark

the same janitor
                      janitor contd
             thinkin they can hide from me
the two stand angelically illuminated    bruce tries to put
everything together

          oh the elevators broken huh
                    janitor

                    bruce

                     janitor

          expecting you

          the janitor

                                                         36



                     janitor

          sleeves son people underestimate
          the benefits of good ol manual
          labor theres freedom in it
          happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day
he strolls down the room takes a seat behind the big desk
                     janitor
          your father knew that he was a
          damn good welder
bruce approaches the desk
                     bruce
          how do you know my father and how
          did you get my pager number
                     janitor
          oh i know a lot about you bruce
          pretty much everything there is to
          know everything youve ever said
          done or thought about doin is
          right there in that file cabinet
he points out a single drawer file cabinet
                     bruce
               sarcastic
          wow a whole drawer just for me
          mind if i take a look
                     janitor
          its your life
bruce pulls the drawer and it flies open dragging him the
full length of the room 
the janitor casually pulls a file
                     janitor
          now this last entry was a little
          disturbing
he thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed dragging bruce back the janitor
reads from the file
                     janitor
               reads scanning
          thanks for everything lord

              everyone with a      brain in their head
              would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind
    bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall sees it has a
    normal back
                           bruce
              okay     thats good   thats a good

              holding out
    bruce extends three fingers
                           god
              three
    he quickly pulls one finger in
                           god
              two
    bruce begins switching fingers rapidly      god doesnt miss a
    beat

                          bruce
              ah hal
    bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
    fingers to god then immediately notices he has seven fingers
    on his one hand

bruce looks at the soup his look grows intense   he slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl
music up the ten commandments theme

the front door blows open as a wind swirls through the diner
and with all the flourish of moses at the red sea bruce
parts his red soup
a little cockroach scurries across the table climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side
                    god os

passes he blows a little air out of the corner of his mouth
and turns to watch her skirt fly up

          and he saw that it was good
he spots a    mannequin in a store window display wearing a
cool casu   al outfit he closes his eyes when he opens

dressed in   his clothes he checks his reflection   better

          freelance field reporter bruce
          nolan was the first on the scene

          since the disapearence of teamster
          president jimmy hoffa in the
          nineteen sixties his whereabouts
          have remained one of this countrys
          great unsolved mysteries that is
          until just moments ago when during
          a routine training session a
          police dog named hank sniffed his
          way right into the history books
          as you can see behind us the body
          is being carefully exhumed and will
          be transported to a hospital
          facility where dna testing will
          confirm the identity that of
          course only a formality as in a
          bizarre twist the body was found
          buried with a birth certificate and
          complete set of dental records
               rubs hanks neck
          sort of a twoinone for hank
          today as moments later he busted
          a local news camera crew with four
          kilos of marijuana
we see footage of phil and his news crew being cuffed on the
ground as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van

                     susan
           i was right she couldnt handle
           the fire
                                                             *
bruce looks at susan with disgust then glances to a fire
alarm on the wall mentally triggers it the sprinklers turn
on as well people scream rush toward the exit
bruce sits down on the sofa being rained on by the
sprinklers alone he finally plops back and god is sitting
next to him

int debbie and mikes house  morning
graces alarm goes off the radio comes on and it plays a
john cougar mellencamp song but the lyrics are different
                     john cougar mellencamp
           heres a little ditty
           about grace and her man bruce
           two americans growing up
           needing to make a truce
graces eyes pop open    is she dreaming
ext debbies house
bruce hides behind a hedge watches grace jog past
on grace
notices something    carved in the tree it reads grace +
bruce carved in     the next tree a couple for the ages
carved in the next    tree come on already give him another
chance she does     a double take continues on
int coffee shop

grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of pictures fall out they are all of bruce and grace she
thinks definitely didnt put them there
int small wonders day care  day

grace is helping one of the kids when she notices something
outside the window its a cloud formation that strangely
looks like bruce in profile holding hands with grace she
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint forgive
him
ext small wonders day care  later

grace is talking with one of the other teachers the kids
playing dodgeball in the background laugh and scream louder
and louder grace turns and sees
bruce getting pelted by multiple balls
                      bruce

he walks over to grace
                      bruce

bruce dramatically raises a hand toward grace like putting a
love spell on her
                     bruce
           now how do you feel
she looks at him oddly
                      grace
