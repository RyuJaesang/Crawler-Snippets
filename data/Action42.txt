                    bourne vo
          so we got in the way   is that
          why neski died is that why you
          killed marie

kramer glances at a photo of marie in the file

                    abbott vo
          you killed marie the minute you
          climbed into her car   the
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

kramer looks at abbotts official photo

                    bourne vo
          i told you people to leave me
          alone! i fell off the grid i
          was half way around the world

                    abbott vo
          theres no place it wont catch
          up to you its how every story
          ends its what you are jason
          a killer! you always will be

thump!

                    cronin
          we think thats bourne hitting
          him on the head and then

he makes a gun with his hand ie bourne putting his gun
to abbotts head

                       abbott vo
          go ahead!     go on! do it!

                    bourne vo
          she wouldnt want me to thats
          the only reason your alive

the tape clicks off

                    kramer

cronin puts a picture of marie in front of kramer

                    landy
          his girlfriend marie she was
          killed in india three weeks ago

kramer looks down at another image     abbott dead after his
suicide

          a dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt russian
          billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by jason bourne you
          couldnt make this stuff up
              holds up the photo of
               abbot dead
          you watched this happen

landy nods   kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation

                    kramer
          bournes last confirmed location
          is moscow three days ago

                       landy
          right

                    kramer
          so what does he do now

                    landy
          i think hes looking for
          something he hasnt found

                       kramer
          like what     whats he after

                     landy
          im not sure maybe he hasnt
          gotten his memory back yet  not
          all of it

a look from kramer

                    kramer
          pam what i need to know is what
          kind of a threat is he to us

                    landy
          if he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to cnn

                    kramer
          maybe he still will maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan i
          dont know i just know my
          number one rule is the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst   as far as im concerned
          bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise

      bourne works to hotwire the car

      a cri car gets to the roof   two agents come from the
      elevator lobby   the three car alarms distract them they
      search for bourne but cant find him at first

      bourne gets the car engine on  but given the wonders of
      modern antitheft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked

                                                                84


      a second cri car arrives

      bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed

      he smashes into the car across the aisle from him with a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in bournes car is suddenly
      free he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops

      three cri cars here now two head straight for him   a
      third blocks the exit ramp

      bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby one carrying the serious firepower
      of an m4 an m16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete they move into position to get a bead
      on him

      bourne assesses but he doesnt move the agents swarm

      the agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward bourne

      but before they can get a bead

      bourne slams the car into reverse again   petal to the
      metal in reverse

      the agents open fire

      bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield
      but theres no dodging the shower of broken glass

      as bourne disappears below the dashboard the cri agent
      adjusts his fire into the cars grill

      virtually blind bourne races the hardpressed vehicle
      backwards as the agents fire decimates the cars
      driveline

      bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him

      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure

      bournes car splits the gap between the parked cars hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall

      bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of bournes
      car to the shooters

      several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      bournes head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars

      the impact rips bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof

      bourne struggles out of the car knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over
      turned car

        bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him

        bournes race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd cri sedan
        slides into view and its occupants open fire on bourne in
        a head on charge

        the just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as bourne reacts
        instantaneously thumbing on the cruise control
        shouldering his door open and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car

        the agents react as bournes sedan torpedoes them head on
        hit hard theyre taken out of the fight as metal collapses
        glass shatters and airbags explode

        bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents

                                                       87


instantly bourne is on his feet moving between the parked
cars to engage another cri sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one

the agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught offguard as bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver

the driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life as the sedan suddenly
accelerates bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedans front tire and fires

the tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan

an instant later bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it

with the wreck still echoing through the garage bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first nypd sedan

bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but bournes performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof
arrives and opens fire

the police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot

the increasing volume of squealing tires alerts bourne to a
new threat he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officers radio
