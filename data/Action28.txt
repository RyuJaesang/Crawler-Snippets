              case you two guys are on point
              sanchez and ruiz you back them
              up with whatever they need
     groans all around
                            lowrey
              so i guess we should start with
              the cis and the perps from the
              original case but hell if i
              know any dope dealers with the
              balls to pull this off theyre
              either dead or in the lockup

              affairs hes our new proctologist
                            sinclair
              you see whats got me confused
              is why risk leaving a witness
              why not kill ofee instead

                            burnett
              because maybe this guy knows if
              you kill a cop the whole
              departmentll get up his ass
              hard and fast
