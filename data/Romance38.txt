               silence  complete silence for the urbanite though the 
               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country  
               a few birds a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy 
               clouds on the horizon a dogs barking

               camera pans the green squaredoff flatland lit only by a 
               fine sunset in its final throes then gradually starting 
               from nothing a rumble is heard quickly growing louder and 
               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized

               camera pans quickly discovering the railroad line atop a 
               manmade rise of land and the speeding passenger train is 
               upon us flashing by with a roar

               then as if from nowhere the figure of a man hits the 
               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the 
               thick underbrush alongside the tracks

               close shot  body

               it lies in the bushes still unmoving  dead camera pans 
               away to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the 
               train fades off until there is silence once more

               title music begins with a crash

               a handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountainside 
               overlooking the french resort town a large open sun deck  
               tables gaily colored parasols sun bathers

               one of the latter is regina lampert a lovely young girl

               she is besides taking in the sun involved in her favorite 
               activity  eating

               then  a dark ominous shape intrudes in the fg focus 
               changes to bring into sharp relief a revolver  shining 
               black and ugly in the sunlight

               reggie unaware of her danger continues to eat

               the finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun 
               shoots  a stream of water arcs with unerring aim straight 
               into reggies face

               another angle

               including jeanlouis a french boy of six or so reggie looks 
               at him sternly

                                     jeanlouis
                              in for trouble
                         oh la

                                     reggie
                         dont tell me you didnt know it was 
                         loaded
                              calling

               sylvie gaudet french attractive blonde in her early 
               thirties comes from the railing of the sun deck to join 
               reggie and jeanlouis

                                     reggie
                         isnt there something constructive 
                         he can do  like start an avalanche

                                     sylvie
                              to jeanlouis
                         va jouer mon ange

               jeanlouis scampers off content to have gotten off so 
               lightly sylvie notices reggies lunch which consists of 
               cold chicken potato salad rolls and butter wine and coffee

                                     sylvie
                         when you start to eat like this 
                         something is the matter

               no answer from reggie sylvie begins reading a magazine as 
               reggie continues eating

                                     reggie

                         i dont know how to explain it im 
                         just too miserable

               reggie picks up a chicken leg and starts off sylvie regards 
               the devastated table before following

                                     sylvie
                         it is infuriating that your

               he slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her then starts 
               to put the things back into the basket while he speaks

               as her head turns in alarm toward the noise there is a 
               moment of silence then footsteps are heard coming closer

               times

               she nods he picks up the airlines bag and they start out

               reggie stops at the door and looks back

                                     reggie
                         i loved this room  but charles 
                         never saw it  only what was in it 
                         all those exquisite things 
                              looking around

               the inspector sits quietly eyes downcast staring at his

               the short heavyset figure of a man is outlined against the

               the door after him leopold gideon shortsighted bald in 
               his middle forties glances around nervously like a barnyard 
               bird then he walks down one of the side aisles of the chapel

               gideon arrives at the coffin he stops looks down at 
               lamperts body for a moment then suddenly in rapid 
               succession he sneezes six times he takes a small bottle 
               from his pocket shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry

               he turns and walks back up the aisle looking for a place to 
               sit he comes face to face with grandpierre stops turns to 
               sit somewhere else

               two shot  reggie and sylvie

               closing the door we see herman scobie a heavyweight  
               tall and wide but not fat  with black hair combed straight 
               back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color which 
               meet over his nose and join up about the same age as the 
               first two men scobie is dressed in a battered raincoat his 
               hands thrust deep in the pockets he marches down the aisle 
               looking straight ahead camera panning with him he stops 
               before the coffin and stares into it

               as he stares down into the coffin his tongue trying to 
               dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth he stares hard 
               at the body squinting his eyes then he removes one hand 
               from his pocket removes a pin from the inside of his lapel 
               picks his teeth with it then slowly lets the hand down 
               into the coffin

               the pin held between thumb and forefinger he jabs it slowly 
               but positively deep into the back of one of the dead mans 
               hands there is no reaction

               close shot  scobie

               he watches the dead man carefully still squinting then 
               finally satisfied he returns the pin to his lapel and walks 
               back up the aisle and out of the door slamming it after 
               him

               close shot  reggie

               having watched scobie exit suddenly a hand falls on her

                         what was all that

                                     reggie
                         fun and games evidently were the

               she rises and pulls him along

               wide angle

               including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it 
               laughing selfconsciously and looking around

                                     emcee
                         Ã©coutez bien  les rÃ¨gles sont tres 
                         simples  the rules are very easy  
                         deux Ã©quipes  two teams  each

                         held under the chin like so 
                              does it
                         comme Ã§a  and passed to the player 
                         behind you  sans vous servir de 
                         vos mains  using nothing but the 
                         chin  no hands  and keeping the 
                         orange at all costs from touching 
                         the floor commencez mesdames et 
                         messieurs  begin ladies and 
                         gentlemen  signore e signori 
                         comminciate!

               the emcee now circulates forming teams telling the patrons 
               to line up making sure there is a woman next to every man 
               reggie and peter are the second couple in their line

               then the emcee picks up a basket of oranges and places one 
               under the chin held securely against the chest of each man 
               at the head of the line blowing a whistle a signal for the 
               game to begin and the band to play the men turn to the women 
               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under 
               their chins to under the chins of the women  without using 
               their hands

               this maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing ones 
               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against 
               the partners throat until he or she can grip it tightly 
               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next 
               in line where the process begins anew however the slightest 
               miscalculation which can be brought about by any number of 
               human frailties  haste modesty inhibition or lack of co
               ordination  will surely result in losing control of the 
               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can 
               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide 
               from its proper place to some other less proper spot on 
               the human anatomy forcing the man or the woman to retrieve 
               it  again with the chin only this latter is an activity 
               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends or even 
               new friends who wish to become old friends but can only be 
               a torment for total strangers and/or the english

               various shots  orange game

               some of the couples in various states of confusion 
               entanglement and intimacy  all of them naturally 
               hilarious

               two shot  peter and girl

               it is his turn to take the orange from a very short but 
               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress held up by an 
               abundance of cantilever peter takes when he sees the 
               twin obstacles which might  and probably will  encumber 
               the game but increase his worldly experience

               the contest begins because of her stature he is forced to 
               move in low making the ordinary embrace needed for success 
               difficult if not impossible then inexorably the orange 
               starts to slip down the girls front manfully he goes after 
               it

               close shot  reggie

               she is enjoying it thoroughly

               two shot  peter and girl

               bending over backwards in a sort of frontal halfnelson 
               peter makes a last valiant effort and voilÃ  grips the orange 
               under his chin  amid much cheering and congratulations 
               from members of his team

               now he turns to reggie and they face one another for a moment

                                     peter
                         en garde

                         lay on macduff

               they go at it working their bodies together to make it all 
               possible then for a moment the game and the onlookers 
               seem less important than their proximity but alas they 
               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is 
               accomplished  again with appreciative cheers from the team

               reggie with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin 
               turns to the next teammember in line and is locked in an 
               embrace before she realizes her partner is leopold gideon 
               the short fat balding man seen at the funeral and later in 
               bartholomews photo

               reggie starts to draw back but gideon holds her tightly

               reggie realizes that gideon no longer offers any resistance

               she steps back leaving gideon holding the orange foolishly 
               under his chin his eyes still closed reggie stares at him

               womens room and a phone cabin with a solid door

               the music and shouting from upstairs float down reggie comes 
               down the stairs and goes to the phone flicking on the light 
               and closing the door after her

               reggie takes a jeton phone token from her bag and drops 
               it in the slot then she takes out a slip of paper the one 
               given her by bartholomew and dials the number written on 
               it she listens to it ring then evidently he answers

                         mr bartholomew can you hear me

               she realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her 
               coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice

                                     reggie

               as reggie and peter enter the small cage it is somewhat

               as reggie leaves the elevator followed by peter they walk 
               to her door there is a moment of silence as she looks at 
               him

                                     reggie

               he turns and leaves she smiles slightly then turns and 
               puts the key into the door and opens it

               int reggies room  night

               featuring the door reggie enters then stops abruptly the 
               doorknob still in her hand

               another angle

               the room has been torn apart and standing in the center is 
               herman scobie the large man in the battered raincoat

               he starts slowly advancing toward reggie

                                     scobie
                         where is it lady  whereve you

                         i dont know  i dont know! i dont 

               she stops as she sees something

               close shot  scobies hand

               instead of a human hand there is a twinpronged metal one

               wider angle

               scobie sees where reggie is staring looks down at it himself 
               then lunges at her raising the hand to strike

                                     scobie
                         i want it  give it to me  its 
                         mine!

               the hand is starting to come down reggie moving quickly 
               turns and flies out

                                     reggie
                              screaming
                         peter  ! peter  !

               int hotel corridor third landing  night

               as reggie runs out slamming the door after her the metal 
               hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and 
               splinters through it visible on this side now petrified 
               with fear reggie can only stare dumbly at the protruding 
               claw

               another angle

               as peter comes running up to her he sees the metal hand

                                     reggie
                         a man  he tried to kill me!

               pulling her aside peter takes hold of the key still in the 
               outside lock and turns it slowly and quietly then using 
               all his weight he slams the door open as far as it will go 
               making sure to hold it that way as he steps in

               int reggies room  night

               inside peter pulls back the door and slugs the startled 
               scobie full on the jaw his head bangs against the wall but 
               he manages to raise a foot and push peter violently away 
               sending him sprawling back toppling across the bed and over 
               head first onto the floor on the other side where he 
               disappears hurrying scobie puts his foot against the door 
               and pushes it away ripping his metal hand free

               he then rushes to the open window and climbs out

               int hotel corridor third landing  night

               reggie waits anxiously when she hears nothing she gingerly 
               looks into the room

               int reggies room  night

                                     reggie
                              entering cautiously
                         peter  
                              alarmed
                         peter! where are you

               another angle

               showing the disarranged room empty of people then slowly 
               peters hand appears from behind the bed shaking groggily

               reggie rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed

                                     reggie

               he starts out pausing by the door and examining the hole 
               scobie made in it

                                     peter

               as peter now called dyle leaves reggies room and closes 
               the door he pauses for a moment listening hears nothing 
               then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one 
               of his socks as usual the thread unravels  and unravels  
               and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock 
               has come unknit now taking the long thread he bends down 
               near the door and taking his tiepin attaches one end of 
               the thread to the bottom of reggies door he then runs the 
               thread along the floor to his door next door and works it 
               underneath

               int dyles room  night

               as dyle enters the thread in his hand he goes to a nearby 
               table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key 
               which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table

                                     scobie
                         and i say maybe you both have it! 
                         one more time dyle  where is it

                                     dyle
                         supposing i did have it  which i 
                         dont  do you really think id 
                         hand it over

                                     scobie
                         youre out dyle  right now!

               scobie aims the gun and starts advancing toward dyle

                                     scobie
                         step back

               dyle turns and looks  there is nothing behind him but a 
               sheer drop to the street

                                     dyle
                         back where

                                     scobie
                         thats the idea

               moving quickly dyle lashes out and hacks scobies gun hand 
               with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof

               following through dyle punches the large man full in the 
               jaw but instead of falling scobie wraps his arm around 
               dyle holding on tightly until his head clears

               then to his amazement dyle is lifted into the air and 
               unable to break the bearhold carried toward the edge of 
               the roof working his arms between their two bodies dyle 
               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold 
               is broken but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his 
               back as scobies metal claw rips through both a wound 
               extending from the center of dyles back to his shoulder

               both men look around for the gun spot it simultaneously and 
               leap for it both landing short of the mark now they grapple 
               with one another each trying to break free and reach for 
               the gun

               close shot  their hands

               two hands one real one metal inch toward the gun

               med shot  dyle and scobie

               the battle is going to scobie whose weight and strength are 
               beginning to tire dyle who is now on his back trying to 
               stop scobie from crawling over him he has the large man by 
               both lapels of the raincoat in a lastditch effort to hold 
               him but scobie his face horribly distorted from the strain 
               continues to inch forward toward the gun

               suddenly dyle releases his hold with nothing restraining 
               him scobie lurches forward tumbling past the gun his 
               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof 
               where he begins sliding down scobie beats wildly at the the 
               slate with his claw trying to gouge a grip

               close shot  scobies claw

               as it slides across the slate making a hideous scratching 
               sound and causing sparks to fly

               med shot  scobie

               as he slides over the edge and disappears

               close shot  dyle

               as he watches hypnotized

               close shot  roof edge

               there appears to be no sign of scobie then camera zooms in 
               for a tight close shot of scobies metal hand gripping the 
               rain gutter at the very edge

               med shot  dyle

               having seen the claw he rises and walks to the very edge of 
               the level part of the roof

                                     dyle
                         herman

               med shot  scobie

               as he hangs seven stories over the street by his metal 
               hand

                                     scobie
                         yeah

               med shot  dyle

               he finds it hard to believe

                                     dyle
                         how are you doing

                         thy neighbor a hundred times on the 
                         side of the building

               dyle turns and leaves going down the stairs

               int hotel corridor  third landing  night

               the hotel manager is busy taping a piece of cardboard over 
               the hole ripped in reggies door by scobies metal hand the 
               night before dyle leaves the elevator and goes to his own 
               door the manager eyes him coldly dyle takes the look

                                     dyle
                         i didnt do it

                         key there is another one at the 
                         desk

               dyle smiles then enters his room

               int dyles room  night

               he closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat 
               wincing

               int reggies room  night

               reggie smoking on the bed sits up when she hears dyle moving 
               about in his room she goes to the connecting door unlocks 
               her side tries the knob finds it still bolted from his 
               side and knocks

                         tickling sensation on the back of

               during the following the vendor makes a doubledecker cone 
               and hands it to reggie dyle pays and they resume their walk

               he pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks 
               inside then shakes his head sadly at what he sees reggie 
               still holds the empty cone not knowing what to do with it

               the room is dark and the phone is ringing he switches on 
               the lamp looks at the clock it reads 330 and shakes his 
               head before picking up the receiver

                                     gideon

                         hey! turn on the lights!

               just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts 
               moving down again gideon shakes his head and leans back 
               whistling again the cage comes to his floor and starts past 
               it seeing this gideon looks confused

               and keeps right on going toward the basement

                         hey! how do you stop this thing

               the elevator passes out of sight still going down there is 
               a silence as the motor stops and then a series of sneezes 
               that ends with a terrifying shriek the night porter rudely 
               awakened runs to the elevator shaft his shoes squeaking 
               horribly he looks up sees nothing then looks down he 
               presses the call button and the motor starts

               an instant later the cage appears and stops the night porter 
               opens the gate pulls back the grill and the camera rushes 
               past him to pick up gideon his body is sitting on the floor 
               of the cage its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a 
               puppets with its strings cut except that gideon has no

                         mr chairman fellow delegates  my 
                         distinguished colleague from italy 
                         her majestys delegation has listened 
                         with great patience to the southern 
                         european position on this problem 
                         and while we find it charmingly 
                         stated we cannot possibly agree 
                         with its content in 1937 in the 
                         british colonies of kenya uganda

                         in 1937 therefore her majestys 
                         government  at that time his 
                         majestys government  was able to

               reggie gets to the gate ahead of adam and manages to crowd 
               in front of some others about to pass through barely 
               stopping she holds out her ticket to the guard to be punched 
               then heads down the platform still running adam gets to 
               the gate but the guard stops him as he tries to pass through

               adam tries to look past him to see reggie but gives it up 
               and goes back toward the ticket booth on the run

               int mÃ©tro passageway  night

               camera leading reggie as she runs  the passageway is nearly 
               empty her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls

               close shot  passageway wall traveling

               the jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly 
               forming a moving band of letters women cartoons and colors

               reggie stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating 
               two different directions an arrow for each

               direction pte dorlÃ©ans pte de clignancourt

               choosing clignancourt she runs off camera pans sharply 
               180 degrees to pick up adam rounding the corner in hot 
               pursuit

               reggie starts down the platform looking behind her every 
               few steps  suddenly she looks up in surprise  there across 
               the tracks on the opposite platform is adam  he has evidently 
               made the wrong turn back in the passageway

               they stare at each other for a moment  then the bell rings 
               announcing the arrival of a train adam turns running back 
               through the exit behind him not knowing what to do reggie 
               looks into the darkness of the tunnel the approaching train 
               can be heard

               she turns to look at the gate  slowly the pneumatic door 
               starts to close as it does the train roars into the station

               int mÃ©tro passageway  night

               the gate can be seen slowly closing adam runs to it tries 
               to force it back but cannot finally he jumps up and 
               commando style vaults over it

               int mÃ©tro platform  night

               reggie is just entering the red center car the two on either 
               side are dark green adam runs for the red car and just 
               manages to make it as the doors shut in unison the latches 
               falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing 
               to inform the motorman to depart the train starts to move

               int mÃ©tro car  night

               the entire length of the car separates adam and reggie

               for a moment their eyes meet then adam starts to weave his 
               way past the other passengers on his way to her

               suddenly he is stopped adam turns to see a train guard

                                     train guard
                         billet monsieur

               adam shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him but 
               again the train guard stops him

                                     train guard

                         but thats what they gave me

               he tries to pull away from the train guard and finds himself 
               staring into the serious face of a gendarme

                                     gendarme
                         monsieur

               the gendarme opens the door for adam and escorts him out

               does

               returns to the exit door and looks at the platform

               blocked by five nuns in large white butterfly hats

               confronted with an iron grill barring her way she tries to 
               open it but it is firmly padlocked a sign hung on it reads

               two at a time and gaining

                         left

               passersby descending the stairs stand aside to let the two 
               strange americans pass watching in wonderment adam is only 
               a few steps behind now

                                     adam

               as reggie wearily gains the top adam lunges for her he 
               manages to grab her foot as he falls forward but all he 
               winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand

               reggie shrieks then regaining her balance continues running 
               limping in her one shoe adam scrambles to his feet and starts 
               after her again

               int mÃ©tro ticket booth area  night

               as reggie still hobbling runs through and toward the stairs

               through he is again several yards behind her

               ext place palais royal  night

               as reggie comes up the stairs from the mÃ©tro she stops long 
               enough to kick off her other shoe then runs across the 
               street ignoring the traffic toward the rue de valois which 
               forms one side of the palais royal adam is gaining on her 
               again

               ext palais royal courtyard  colonnade  night

               the smaller court at the comÃ©diefranÃ§aise end of the palais 
               gardens separated from the larger garden by a double 
               peristyle consisting of two twin rows these separated from 
               each other by a small marble court of twenty columns each  
               in all eighty columns the only person in sight is the man 
               we have known as bartholomew waiting at the far end of the 
               columns looking at his watch impatiently

               then from the rue de valois side of the palais reggie runs 
               into the court she spots bartholomew and fishes in her 
               bag for the stamps as she runs taking them out and waving 
               them

                                     reggie
                         mr bartholomew  hes chasing me!

               adam has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the 
               near end of the colonnade as he spots bartholomew reggie 
               still running is halfway between the two men bartholomew 
               draws his gun but cant get a shot at adam who has ducked 
               in among the columns

                                     adam
                         reggie  stop! thats carson dyle!

               this news hits reggie hard and she stops in alarm

               she looks at bartholomew then back at adam who has drawn 
               his own gun

               note both bartholomew and adam are in among the stone 
               columns at opposite ends of the colonnade keeping out of 
               each others sight reggie stands out in the open the stamps 
               in her hand confused as to which man she should go to

                                     bartholomew
                              calmly

               bonus item  lyrics to the theme song of the film

                

                                         charade

                      music by henry mancini words by johnny mercer

               when we played our charade we were like children posing 
               playing at games acting out names guessing the parts we 
               played

               oh what a hit we made we came on next to closing best on 
               the bill lovers until love left the masquerade

               fate seemed to pull the strings i turned and you were gone

               while from the darkened wings the music box played on

               sad little serenade song of my hearts composing i hear it 
               still i always will best on the bill charade
