          the american indian couple scans a menu
          and milton the old guy from our opening scans herhe
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of colorado as

          when she moves aside we see shes lined up a skull over his
          missing eye

          a vehicle approaches
          milton slides from the hood steps protectively in front of
          piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward them pulls to the
          side of the road

          pov from approaching vehicle
          from this angle it looks as though an innocent old man and
          his granddaughter are having car trouble

          pov from behind the gto
          from this angle we can see milton concealing the shotgun
          behind him piper stands close her hand on the handle of
          the 357 protruding from his waistband

                         on wrecker
          as the driver steps outstands half hidden by the door as

                         we 

          move to reveal
          like piper the driver has his right hand tucked behind his
          back wrapped around the handle of a 44 magnum

          driver os
          thought you were dead

          suddenly the accountant moves fast he bats the gun aside
          snatches the kids uniform shirt and pulls it open popping
          two buttons

          out of the back glass as the nova speeds up
          fasterfaster the sun suddenly time lapses across the
          sky the landscape blurs only the nova and the moving sun
          remainuntil the sun dips into the western horizon and
          vanishesreplaced by one hell of a bright full moon

          ext somewhere in nevada  night

          suddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a
          rocky outcropping in the distance
          we slow and drop toward the ground until were mere inches
          above the cracked earthwe come to a stop

                         foom

          drums bongos theres chanting and laughter
          piper rises and gazes at him over the roof shes scared
          milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband slides the
          ancient revolver into a leather hipholster then he leans in
          and grabs his shotgun

                         milton
          stay here
          piper nods
          milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon
          we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as milton
          moves toward a cliffs edge

          ext stilwater marsh  cliffs edge  night

          milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge

          a twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below the ravine
          is filled with giant oil derricks like metallic trexs
          rising and falling to the shriek of oiled metal
          and in the center of this jurassic gathering a crowd of
          people dance and sway around a giant bonfire it is
          celebration ritual and orgy rolled into one
          brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar on the
          opposite side of the oilrig ravine  the battered rv sits
          like a mobile command post

          milton walks slowly back toward the nova his head lowered
          in deep thought how does one man and a kid take on forty
          suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!
          he jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead

          jonah raises the barrel to miltons forehead then
          someone near clears his throat
          jonah turns stares
          the accountant leans against the novas hulk he winks
          at jonahs feet milton scrambles forward and we realize he
          wasnt crawling toward his grandbaby
          he was crawling toward the ancient revolver
          he snatches it rolls onto his back as
          jonah swings his gun toward milton 

          kafoom!

          jonahs head is obliterated the force yanks his headless
          body into the air spins it skywards in a plume of flame
          the accountant moves away watching as 
          the burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the nova

          the gas ignites
          flames erupt with thunder clear to the heavens  the nova
          roars one final time living up to its name in a furious
          ball of fire that consumes whatevers left of jonah king

          they walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
          yellow glowthen
          they fade into the shimmering heat
          and they are gone

          fade to black
