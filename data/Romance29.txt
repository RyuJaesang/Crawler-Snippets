fade in

int bedroom  closeup of bonnie parker  day

blonde somewhat fragile intelligent in expression  she is
putting on makeup with intense concentration and
appreciation applying lipstick and eye makeup  as the
camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we
have been looking into a mirror  she is standing before the
fulllength mirror in her bedroom doing her makeup  she
overdoes it in the style of the time rosebud mouth and so
forth  as the film progresses her makeup will be refined
until at the end there is none

the camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly
throughout the first part of this scene  as the camera
continues to move away we see by degrees that bonnie is
naked  her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the
audience but implied  that is she should be covered in
various ways from the cameras pov but the audience must
be aware of her exposure to clyde later in the scene  this
is the only time in the film that she will ever be this
exposed in all senses of the word to the audience  her
attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with
narcissism

the bedroom itself is a secondstory bedroom in a lower
class frame house in west dallas texas  the neighborhood
is low income  though the room reveals its shabby
surroundings it also reveals an attempt by bonnie to fix it
up  small and corny objets dart are all over the tops of
the bureaus vanity tables etc little glass figurines and
porcelain statuettes and the like

bonnie finishes admiring herself  she walks from the mirror
and moves slowly across the room the camera moving with
her until she reaches the screened window on the opposite
wall  the shade is up  there are no curtains  she looks
out the window looking down and the camera looks down with
her

ext bedroom  bonnies pov  day

over her shoulder we see the driveway leading to the garage
connected to the house  there is an old car parked in the
driveway its windows open  we see a man walking up the
driveway somewhat furtively  he is a rather dapper fellow
dressed in a dark suit with a vest a white collar and a
straw boater  it is clyde barrow  obviously he is about
to steal the car  he looks it over checking around him to
make sure no passersby are coming  he peers inside the
front window to see if the keys are in the ignition  he
studies the dashboard  bonnie continues watching silently
finally she calls out

                                                            2


                         bonnie
            hey boy!  what you doin with my
            mamas car

ext driveway  day

clyde startled jumps and looks to see who has caught him
obviously frightened he looks up and his face freezes at
what he sees

ext window  clydes pov  day

we now see what he is looking at at the open window
revealed from the waist up is the naked bonnie  she looks
down an impudent halfsmile on her face  she doesnt move
or make any attempt to cover herself

ext closeup of clyde  day 

 whose face changes from astonishment to an answering
smile of impudence  seeing what he has he realizes that
this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police
already they are in a little game instigated by bonnie
sizing each other up competing in a kind of playful
arrogance  before they speak they have become
coconspirators

closeup of bonnie still smiling  finally she speaks

                         bonnie
            wait there!

int bedroom  day

running from the window she flings open a closet and grabs
a dress and shoes  she slips on the shoes and flings the
dress on running out the door as she does  the camera
tracks with her moving as fast  as she runs down the
stairs she buttons up the dress

ext driveway  day

she flies out the door slamming it behind her runs off the
porch all this has been one continuous movement since she
left the window in great haste and continues quickly into
the driveway  four feet away from clyde she stops on a
dime  they stand there looking at each other smiling the
same challenge  for a few seconds no one speaks then

                         bonnie
                   putting her on
            aint you ashamed  tryin to steal
            an old ladys automobile

                         clyde

            and since it dont look like youre

                         clyde

ext street  moving shot  day

the camera tracks  it is a hot texas afternoon all white
light and glare  as they walk the block to town in this
scene their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading

                         bonnie
                   slightly startled by
                   his accuracy anxious
                   to get back now that
                   he is temporarily

            the driveway these days

they reach the corner and turn  they are on

ext main street  day

a smalltown street of barber shops cafes groceries etc
at the moment it is deserted  they continue walking down
the empty street  clyde looks the place over  tracking

                                                            5

            state prison huh

clyde laughs enjoying her repartee  they continue walking
at a hydrant clyde stops

                         clyde
                   showing off but seriously
            see this foot
                   pointing at his
                   right foot
            i chopped two toes off of it  with
            an axe

                         bonnie
                   shocked
            what  why

                         clyde
            to get off the damn work detail

                         bonnie
                   a lady of some sensitivity

                   turning a cute
            i surely dont intend to stand here
            and look at your dirty feet in the
            middle of main street

they continue walking in silence past a few stores each
planning what next to say

                         bonnie
            boy did you really do that

                         clyde

                                                            6


ext gas station  day

gas station up the block  bonnie and clyde are seen leaning
against the soft drink chest their profiles silhouetted by
the bright sun  they are drinking cokes  as they begin to
talk the camera moves in closer to them  clyde takes off
his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead
bonnie watches him

                         bonnie
            whats it like

                         clyde
            prison

                         bonnie
                   very interested
            no armed robbery

                         clyde
                   he thinks it a silly question
            itsi dont knowit isnt like
            anything

                         bonnie
                   thinking shes heard
                   proof that hes a liar
            hah!  i knew you never robbed bo
            place you faker

                         clyde
                   challenged
            oh yeah
                   studies her then
                   makes up his mind to
                   show her


closeup  gun  day  he reaches in his jacket and pulls
out a gun  the camera moves to a closeup of the gun
glinting in the sunlight

ext street  day

the camera pulls back to show bonnie looking at it with
fascination  the weapon has an immediate effect on her
she touches it in a manner almost sexual full of repressed
excitement

                         bonnie
                   goading him on
            yeah well you got one all right i
            guessbut you wouldnt have the
            gumption to use it

                                                            7


                         clyde
                   picking up the
                   challenge proving himself
            you just keep your eyes open

ext little grocery store across the street  day

the camera remains just behind bonnies shoulder so that
throughout the following scene we have bonnie in the picture
looking at what we look at

clyde goes into the little store  we remain outside with
bonnie watching  for a minute nothing happens  we can
barely see what is going on in the store  then clyde comes
out walking slowly  in one hand he holds the gun in the
other a fistful of money  he gets halfway to bonnie and
smiles broadly at her a smile of charm and personality
she smiles back  the moment is intense as if a spark has
jumped from one to the other  their relationship which
began the minute bonnie spotted him in the driveway has now
really begun  clyde has shown his stuff and bonnie is
turned on

suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes
running out into the street completely dumbfounded  he
stands there and says nothing yet his mouth moves in silent
protest  clyde points the gun above him and fires  it is
the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a
shock  the old man terrified runs back into the store as
fast as he can clyde quickly grabs bonnies hand  the
camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down
the street  a few yards and the stores disappear entirely
the landscape turns into that arid flat and unrelieved
western plain that begins where the town ends

ext store  at the edge of town  day

a car is parked at the back of the store  as soon as they
reach it clyde motions and bonnie gets in  clyde runs to
the front lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make
it start  as he stands back bonnie calls to him

                         bonnie
            hey whats your name anyway

                         clyde
                   he slams the hood
            clyde barrow

he runs over to the door opens it shoves her over and
starts up the engine  the entire sequence is played at an
incredible rapid pace

                                                            8


                         bonnie
                   loud to make
                   herself heard over
                   the gunning motor
            hi im bonnie parker  please to
            meet you

ext road  day

vroom!  the car zooms off down the road doing 90  the fast
country breakdown music starts up on the sound track going
just as fast as the car

ext car  day

the car still speeding further down the road  we zoom
down and look in the rear window  clyde is driving we see
from behind  bonnie is all over him biting his ear
ruffling his hair running her hands all over himin short
making passionate love to him while he drives  the thrill
of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually

ext car  another angle  day

the camera pulls back and above the car  the car starts to
go crazy in a comical fashion manifesting to the audience
just what is happening to the driver controlling it  the
car swerves all over the road  the car comes to a sudden
halt  the car starts again  it swerves this time almost
right off the road before it straightens out  it jumps and
jerks  another car comes down the road the other way and
clydes car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive
right off the road into the dirt  it is almost mack sennett
stuff but not quite that much

int car  bonnie and clyde  day

bonnie grabs the wheel and turns it sharply

ext car  day

it hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees

int car  bonnie and clyde  day

still settling to a stop  bonnie and clyde appear to be
necking heavily now punctuated by bonnies squeals of
passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea trying to
get to clyde  the floor gearshift is keeping their bodies
apart however  in exasperation bonnie takes the gear
shift and shoves it forward out of their way  she plunges
onto clyde burying him from view

                                                            9


                         bonnie
                   kissing biting
            you ready

                         clyde
                   muffled laughing
            hey wait

                         bonnie
                   giggling herself
            arent you ready  well get ready!

bonnie has obviously touched him  with savage coquetry she
tears into her clothes and his

                         bonnie
                   muffled
            cmon honey cmon boylets
            golets

                         clyde
                   muffled
            heyhey wait a minutequit
            that now cut it out
                   sharply
            i said cut it out!

he shoves her rudely away slamming her into the far car
door  suddenly it looks as if theyve been fighting  both
unbuttoned and unglued they stare silently at one another
breathing heavily  clyde gets out of the car clearly
shaken  despite the fact that he may have encountered this
situation many times before its one that no twentyone
yearold boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss
easily with bravado

bonnie remains seated in the car  she seems terribly
vulnerable  she fumbles about for a cigarette too confused
to figure out what didnt happen  clyde turns back and
reaches through the car window from the drivers side
lighting it for her  bonnie casts clyde a fishy stare then
accepts the light

                         clyde
                   trying to be casual
                   even insouciant
            look i dont do that  its not
            that i cant
                   his voice cracks
                   the match burns his
                   fingers and he bangs
                   his head onto roof of
                   car and he goes
                   right on
            its just that i dont see no
            percentage in it
                         more

                                                           10


                         clyde contd
            i mean theres nothin wrong with
            me i dont like boys

bonnie doesnt know what she thinks and clyde is trying to
gauge her reactionwhether she feels rejected or repelled
in fact its bothalong with a little latent fascination

                         bonnie
                   finally spitting
                   out smoke
            boyboyboy

                         clyde
                   a little annoyed
            boy what

                         bonnie
            your advertising is dandy  folksd
            just never guess you dont have a
            thing to sell
                   a little afraid
            you better take me home now

                         clyde
                   getting back into car
            wait!

                         bonnie
            dont touch me!

she gets out of car leaving clyde draped across the front
seat reaching after her

                         clyde
                   almost shouting
            if all you wants stud service
            then get on back to west dallas and
            stay there the rest of your life!

this stops her  now clyde pours it on with an almost
maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets
control of bonnie

                         clyde
            but youre worth moren that a lot
            more and you know it and thats
            why you come along with me  you
            could find a lover boy on every
            corner in town and it doesnt make
            a damn to them whether youre
            waiting on tables or picking
            cotton so long as you cooperate
            but it does make a damn to me!

int roadside cafe  bonnie and clyde  day

bonnie and clyde seated in booth now cu clyde  the sound
track bridges the scene the question that bonnie has just
asked is now suddenly rebutted by clyde as he points a
finger at her

                         clyde
                   not answering her
                   preferring to lead
                   the conversation
            ill tell you about you

he loves doing this and he does it well  the more he
envisions bonnies life the more instinctively accurate he
becomes  she grows more and more fascinated like a child
watching a mind reader

                         clyde

            right  cement plant  and you
            liked him cause he thought you was
            just as nice as you could be  you
            almost married that guy but
            thenyou thought no you didnt
            think you would  so you got your

            and every morning you wake up and
            you hate it  you just hate it
            and you get down there and you put
            on your white uniform

                                                           13

                   enthralled
            pink

                         clyde
            and the truck drivers come in to
            eat greasy burgers and they kid you
            and you kid them back but theyre
            stupid and dumb boys with big
            tattoos all over em and you dont
            like itand they ask you for
            dates and sometimes you gobut
            you mostly dont and all they ever
            try is to get into your pants
            whether you want to or notand
            you go home and sit in your room
            and think when and how will i ever
            get away from thisand now you
            know

bonnie is halfmesmerized by his talk  a waitress comes
with their food  a cheap gaudy dame she has spit curls on
each temple in the style of the times  clyde looks at her
and at bonnie who also wears spit curls  as soon as the
waitress leaves

                         clyde
                   pointing at her hair
            change that  i dont like it

without a word of protest bonnie immediately reaches in her
bag and takes out a mirror  she holds it up and with the
other hand brushes back her spit curls into her hair  she
never again wears them  when she has pushed them back she
looks at clyde for his approval  he nods his okay  she
smiles puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food
shes ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on
her plate  clyde doesnt touch his food just watches
bonnie eat for a minute

                         clyde
            god youre a knockout

ext roadside cafe  day for dusk

clyde and bonnie emerge from the cafe into the early evening
they move toward the car they have stolen  just beyond sits
a newer model car  bonnie is surprised to see clyde head
toward the newer car

                         bonnie
            hey that aint ours

                                                           14

she walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him
he turns the key and they pull away from the cafe

int abandoned farm house  a wide shot of the parlor living

the room is bare  in the middle bonnie is waking having
slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of
tattered blanket  there are windows behind her  she looks
about bewildered

            clyde

she starts to panic and runs to the window

                         bonnie
                   continuing
            clyde

at another window clyde appears

            hey lady

                         bonnie

disappear

            come on  got you all set up over
            here

wider angle  they move around to the side of the building
where clyde points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree
he means that to be bonnies target  he hands her a gun

                         clyde
            set her spinnin

bonnie fires  she misses

                         clyde
            again  come down slow with it

bonnie fires again and hits the tire  she smiles and blows
the smoke from the barrel in pride and selfmockery

                         clyde

hits the tire

                                                           16


clyde whirls at the sound  he grabs gun from bonnie because
his is empty  he aims at farmer

                         farmer
                   frightened
            no sirno sir  you all go right

clyde watches him warily

                         farmer
                   continuing
            used to be my place  not any more
            bank took it

clyde and bonnie start to move toward the farmer  all three
move around to the front of the building  at a distance we
see an okie car loaded with belongings  a woman with a baby
in arms sits in front  a smaller boy stands outside the car

                         farmer
            yessir moved us off  now it
            belongs to them
                   he points at the
                   foreclosure sign


                         bonnie
            well thats a pitiful shame

clyde shakes his head sympathetically  he loads the empty
gun

                         farmer
                   bitterly
            youre damned right mam

he looks up to see an old negro who has come from a distance
shack and now stands near clydes car

                         farmer
                   nodding toward negro
            me and him put in the years here
            yessir  so you all go right ahead
            we just come by for a last look

he stands a moment looking at the house and then turns
around toward his family in the car  clyde and bonnie look
after him  clyde spins and fires three fast shots into the
foreclosure sign  the farmer stops and turns looking at
clyde  clyde offers the gun to the farmer  he looks at it
then accepts it  he slowly takes aim at the sign and fires
it pleases him  he looks at clyde and bonnie who smile

                                                           17

bonnie and clyde are puzzled

                         farmer
            hey davis!  come on over here

the negro moves toward them  now bonnie understands  she
takes the second gun from clyde and hands it to davis
davis looks from bonnie to the farmer and toward the house
the farmer fires again  this time at a window  he nods to
davis  davis slowly raises the gun and fires at another
window  it shatters and they cant keep from laughing  the
farmer returns the gun as does davis

                         farmer
                   continuing

the bills  he smiles  suddenly looming beside clyde is the
butcher brandishing a meat cleaver  camera looks up at
this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down
missing clyde and sticking in the wooden counter  he grabs
clyde around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him
off the ground  the struggle is in silence  clyde is

inside and drops the money on her lap  we see the bills
flutter down  not a word is spoken  bonnie moves over into

tune quietly  the sound track picks it up banjo and
violin etc and as the music swells they drive off down
the road

humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach is the
butcher  his head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a
liquid through a bent glass straw  camera is on the left
side of the head of the bed seeing the butcher in a three
quarter profile  on the opposite side of the bed stands a
uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mugshot
photos for the butcher to identify his assailant  the
lawman holds a stack of them in front of them swiftly
changing the cards like a gradeschool teacher with her
flash cards  at each picture the butcher grunts negatively
and goes on sipping from his glass straw  one picture two
three go by  the fourth picture is a mug shot of clyde
again the butcher grunts no without hesitation  as the
next picture comes into view we

to the immediate action he happens to be involved with he
takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling
sugar over all his food  he sugars the meat the beans and
the beets  bonnie and clyde watch this performance with
first amazement and second disgust  they cant believe
what they see

                         bonnie

eat  suddenly a look of consternation crosses cws face

                         cw
            damn!  no mayonnaise!

he gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of
the restaurant out of our vision apparently planning to
put mayonnaise over the sugar  the minute he is out of
earshot bonnie gets clydes attention

sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark
table surface  he will sketch his plan in the sugar

                         clyde

a smile

who becomes visible is cw  he is staring at the screen and
eating bites from a candy bar in each hand  camera pans
further and we see that clyde is in the row behind cw and
a few seats to one side  clyde is nervous and keeps watching
the entrance doors  he is in a rage  he shifts in his seat

                         clyde

fixing her makeup in the mirror  the makeup has become
more conservative  on the left further back is a bathtub
and in it sits cw  his head and knees peek over the gray
soapy water  he is engaged with his usual singleminded
concentration in washing himself carefully scrubbing his
arms not a thought in his head  bonnie finishes her make
up and regards herself quizzically tilting her head to look
at herself at different angles  she is smoking a cigarette
and really studying herself

                         bonnie
            what do you think of me cw

                         cw
            uhwell youre just fine i
            guess  uh well course youre a
            real good shotanduhwell
            sometimes you look pretty as a
            painting

camera stays with bonnie during all this watching her look
at herself as she listens to cws evaluation  she has a
narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him
enumerate her values she thinks about each in turn and
decides yes thats true

                         cw
            hey uh bonniecould you get me
            that washrag there

responding automatically bonnie turns and walks to a towel
rack pulls the washcloth off and starts toward cw when
suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden
motion  teasingly she holds the washcloth out at arms
length

                         bonnie
                   coyly
            whynt you come get it

                         cw
                   not even realizing
                   whats on her mind
            huh

                         bonnie
                   wiggling the
                   washcloth like a
                   bullfighters cape
            whynt you come get it cw

                                                           33


suddenly cw looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what
that would entail

                         cw
            aw bonnie come on gimme it

bonnie tries another tack  she begins sauntering over
slowly teasingly still holding out the treasured washcloth

                         bonnie
                   pertly
            all right ill bring it myself

as she moves closer to the tub cw realizes that she will
be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he
frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth
into the tub causing a great splash  bonnie somewhat the
victim of the splash jumps back and away  recovering her
composure she looks at cw who is slunk down in the tub
like a gross september morn  she has tried him and he has
failed she realizes now that he was no choice for her no
real man even if he might perform sexually  he is a lump
this irritates her his very presence is demeaning to
herself and clyde

                         bonnie
                   irritated with
                   herself for even
                   thinking of such a thing
            you simpleton what would you do if
            we just pulled out some night while
            you was asleep

                         cw
                   trying to give the
                   right answer but
                   obviously faking it
            oh i wouldnt know what to do
            but you wouldnt do that  you
            couldnt now

bonnie realizes with some weariness the inevitable truth
of what hes said thus resigned she says patronizingly

                         bonnie
            thats right cw  well always be
            around to take care of you

pointedly she throws her cigarette in his bathwater
sssssssssss  she turns and leaves the bathroom slamming
the door behind her

                                                           34


int bedroom

camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom  clyde is
sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling
them  he is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of
bonnies present condition  the moment she enters he looks
up

                         clyde
                   quietly
            bonnie i want to talk to you  sit
            down

bonnie sits a little taken off balance by his serious
manner  but she listens quietly

                         clyde
                   continuing
            this afternoon we killed a man and
            we were seen  now nobody knows who
            you are yet but theyre going to
            be after me and anybody whos
            runnin with me  now thats murder
            now and its gonna get rough
                   bonnie nods  clyde
                   continues speaking
                   carefully and gently
            look i cant get out but right
            now you still can  you say the
            word and ill put you on the bus to
            go back to your mother  cause you
            mean a lot to me honey and i
            aint going to make you run with me
            so if you want you say the word

bonnie moved by his offer has tears in her eyes

                         clyde
                   as he pauses
            why  we aint gonna have a minutes
            peace

bonnie doesnt like him in this mood  she tries to josh him
out of it

                         bonnie
            oh pshaw

                         clyde
                   trying to make her
                   see the seriousness
                   of it
            bonnie we could get killed

                                                           35


                         bonnie
                   death has no reality
                   for her
            whod wanna kill a sweet young
            thing like me

                         clyde
                   amused in spite of himself
            i aint no sweet young thing

                         bonnie
            oh clyde i cant picture you with
            a halo and if you went to the
            other place youd rob the devil
            blind so hed kick you right back
            to me

closeup  clydetouched deeply realizes that this was a
lovely thing to say to him

int motel bedroom

they kiss  they are near the bed on which are some guns
that clyde has been cleaning  the kiss moves toward real
love making  they are on the bed and push the guns aside
some fall to the floor  clyde breaks the embrace after it
has reached a high pitch  he moves away from the bed toward
the window  bonnie follows him and embraces him from the
rear  they are miserable  bonnie frees him and returns to
the bed  she falls on it face down  a gun presses into her
face  clyde sits in the window the light silhouettes him
he turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the
window pane  bonnie turns to him from bed  she smiles a
comforting smile at him  she rolls over onto her back  the
gun is now under her head and moves it  she sits up and
gestures to clyde  he remains at the window  she stares at
him  she looks toward the bathroom  she looks back at
clyde  she is moved and pained for him  she touches her
cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at
her  finally he does  her look eases him and he almost
smiles

is overjoyed to see his brother  buck jumps out of the car

they laugh happily and begin sparring with each other
faking punches and blocking punchesan old childhood ritual
there is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers
clyde is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before

camera swings to car  we see blanche still sitting there
her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield

                   stiffly

there is an awkward pause  suddenly the screen door opens
and cw comes out dressed in his long underwear  blanche
can hardly stand it

                         clyde

he pumps bucks hand vigorously and then goes to blanche
with his characteristic onetrack intensity he decides to
act just as friendly as he can with blanche ignoring the
fact that hes standing there in his underwear  blanche
however is not ignoring it

                         cw
            well how do mrs barrow  or can i
            call you blanch  i sure am pleased

                   blanche is slowly
                   going crazy with mortification

blanche is starting to edge over to buck in sheer panic at
this strange young man in his bvds but cw takes no
notice of it

blanche finally grabs bucks arm  bonnie watches it all
smirking

                         buck
            hey lemme get the kodak!

buck goes to his car and gets a folding brownie camera

                         clyde
                   lighting up a cigar

bonnie watches blanches behavior with hardlyveiled disgust
buck snaps the picture as blanche is just about to move out
of it

                         blanche
                   with unbecoming
                   girlish outrage
            did you take my picture  oh buck!
            i declare

buck laughs and goes to bonnie takes her by the arm and
moves her next to clyde and blanche  he lines them up
steps back and takes their picture  clyde is the only one
smiling

                         clyde
                   pulling out his gun
                   and posing like a
                   movie tough
            hey buck get one of this

                   throwing her a challenge

bonnie grins at him and responds with amused arrogance

                         bonnie
                   she yanks the cigar
                   from clydes mouth
                   smokes it and poses

            shes a real peach

there is now a long pausea lull in the conversation as if
they asked each other all the questions and are now out of
things to say  it is too much for buck the natural enemy
of silence who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts
out animatedly

                         buck
            boy are we gonna have us a good
            time!

clyde and buck explode in laughter

open on bonnie and clyde  he is cleaning guns  she is
watching something off screen  we hear a clicking sound

                         blanche os
            my you need a haircut daddy  you
            look like a hillbilly boy

                                                           46


a look of disgust crosses bonnies face  clyde who has
been watching her smiles  the clicking sound increases
suddenly

                         buck os
            gotcha!

blanche whoops  camera cuts to see that buck and cw are
playing checkers and buck has just beaten him

                         cw
            again

                         buck
            boy you aint never gonna beat me

            checkers all the time and doesnt
            pay any attention to his poor
            lonely wife

she ruffles his hair again

                         buck
            cut it out now honey  im gonna
            teach this boy a lesson hell never
            forget

camera cuts to bonnie watching with disgust  then slowly
a wicked little smile edges across her face  she watches
for a moment more then she rises and with the most ingenuous
look she can muster up beckons to clyde to follow her into
the bedroom  a little puzzled clyde follows

int bedroom

bonnie closes the door and immediately begins fussing with
clydes hair doing a scathing imitation of blanche  though
her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with
the barrow menage it is also a peach doing an imitation of
a lemonand it is disarmingly sensual indeed the mimicry
allows bonnie to be physically freer with clyde and allows
clyde to respond without anxiety without selfconsciousness
we should have the distinctif momentaryfeeling that
clyde could suddenly make it with bonnie

                                                           47


                         bonnie
                   doing an unmerciful imitation
            oh daddy you shore need a haircut
            you look just like a little old
            hillbilly boy i do declare
                   she has her other
                   hand toying with the
                   buttons on his shirt
                   her hand slipping
                   under fluttering
                   across his bare chest
            oh mercy me oh my stars!

clyde laughs and bonnie tugs at the shirtshe kneels on
the bed over clyde who quite easily drapes across it

                         bonnie
                   a little louder
            oh daddy!  yore such a slowpoke!

shes letting her hair fall loose its golden ends brushing
up and down clydes body

                         clyde
                   amused but cautionary
            hush up a little  theyre in the
            next room

                         bonnie
                   a mockpout but
                   with an edge to it
            shoot theres always somebody in
            this room the next room and ever
            other kind of room

clyde has his arm around bonnie and shes almost draped
across himbut in the direction of the length of the bed
so their bodies almost form a crooked cross  she digs an
elbow into his stomach

                         clyde
            oof!now that aint no nice way
            to talk about my brother

                         bonnie
                   imitating blanche
                   again with baby talk
            i aint talking about your brother

suddenly bonnie straightens up to a kneeling position again
and cocks her head  when she speaks now it is with a simple
plaintiveness

                                                           48


                         bonnie
            honey do you ever just want to be
            alone with me
                   sensing clydes
                   sensitivity to the
                   sexual implication
            i dont just mean like thati
            mean do you ever have the notion of
            us bein out together and alone
            like at some fancy ball or i
            dont know where we walk in all
            dressed and they announce us and
            its fancy and in public but were
            alone somehow  were separate from
            everybody else and they know it

clyde looks up to bonnie affectionately  he runs his hand
carelessly down her body

                         clyde
            i always feel like were separate
            from everybody else

                         bonnie
                   its terribly
                   important to her
            do you baby

suddenly there is a ring at the door  bonnie and clyde
freeze

int living room

bonnie and clyde run out into the living room camera going
with them

                         bonnie
                   to all
            quiet!  ill get it

bonnie goes down the stairs and reaches the front door

                         bonnie
            who is it

            six dollars and fortythree cents

bonnie pays him and goes to take the bags from him

            here mam them bags is heavy
            let me carry em up for you

                   curtly
            no thanks ill take em

she takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and
walks up the stairs  they are obviously very heavy for her
closeup the delivery boys face looking puzzled at this
behavior  bonnie reaches the top steps and voices are heard

                         bucks voice
            what was it

            its called the ballad of suicide
            sal
                   she pauses for
                   effect then begins
            we each of us have a good alibi
            for being down here in the joint
            but few of them really are justified
            if you get right down to the point
            youve heard of a womans glory
            being spent on a downright cur

                         bonnie
            you want to hear this or not

as she reads the camera pans around the room picking out
everyones reaction  clyde is looking and listening
seriously  buck is grinning  cw is blank  blanche is in
the kitchen cooking

                         bonnie
            still you cant always judge the
            story
            as true being told by her
            now sal was a gal of rare beauty
            though her features were coarse and
            tough

                         buck
            yeah i knew her  she was cockeyed
            and had a harelip and no teeth!

bonnie flashes him a look that could kill  he shuts up fast
she continues

                         bonnie
            now sal was a gal of rare
            beauty
            though her features were coarse and
            tough
            she never once faltered from duty
            to play on the up and up

still listening clyde gets up from his chair and walks
slowly past the living room windows  the camera angled
slightly above him sees down the street  we see two police
cars quietly pulling up  one of them parks sideways in the
driveway to block escape from the garage the other stays on
the street  clyde turns and looks out the window

                         bonnie
                   os as we see out
                   the window
            sal told me this tale on the
            evening
            before she was turned out free
            and ill do my best to relate it
            just as she told it to me

                         clyde
                   seeing it
            its the law

                                                           51


as soon as clyde calls out blanche drops the frying pan on
the floor and begins screaming  camera cuts back to the
living room  everyone else leaps into action  guns begin
blazing from everywhere we rarely see who is shooting at
whom

without a word clyde stops the car

ext roadside  day

bonnie and clyde get out and walk fifteen feet away from the
car  both are irritated and touchy  camera follows them

                         clyde
                   coldly
            what is it

                         bonnie

                         clyde
            why  whats the matter with you
            anyway

            damn stupid back country hick
            without a brain in her head
                   contemptuously
            she aint nothin but prunes and
            proverbs

                         clyde
                   really pissedoff at bonnie
            what makes you any better  what
            makes you so damn special  youre
            just a west dallas waitress who
            spent half your time pickin up
            truck drivers!

this hits home with bonnie  he has said the unforgivable

                         bonnie
                   raising her voice
            you talk to me like that!  big
            clyde barrow just the same as your
            brother an ignorant uneducated
            hillbilly
                   with deadly archness
            only special thing about you is
            your peculiar ideas about
            lovemakinwhich is no love makin
            at all

                                                           54


clyde stiffens  the two of them stand silent and tense
almost quivering with anger  they have stripped each other
raw  clyde turns and looks back at the car  everyone is
waiting watching them  he breathes a deep sigh like a man
counting to 10 to hold his temper

                         clyde
            look bonnie

he cant finish

close  bonnie  she drops her head into her hand for a
moment comes up a little more relaxed  she looks at clyde
and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has
inflicted on him  she softens

                         bonnie
            clydehoneyi didnt mean all
            that honey  blame it on all that

                         clyde
            okayokay honlets get
            movin

he turns and begins walking back to the car  bonnie walks
alongside him  on the few steps back she regains all her
dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her  she
reaches the car  clyde opens her door for her and she gets
in like a great lady  he walks around to his side gets in
and they drive off

wide shot  ext car  day

a very wide shot  we see clydes car driving along a wooded
road  for a moment that is all we see then we should
become aware that far in the distance another car is
following clydes

close rural mail box  on the opposite side of the road
clydes car swings across the road and clyde who is driving
snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands
it into the car  they drive out of the shot  camera holds
and soon the following car enters the shot  the man driving
is a texas ranger  he drives slowly  he drives out of the
shot

int clydes car

buck is reading from the paper

                                                           55


                         buck
                   jubilantly
            hey yall listen to this here
            law enforcement officers throughout
            the southwest are frankly amazed at
            the way in which willofthewisp
            bandit clyde barrow and his yellow
            haired companion bonnie parker
            continue to elude their wouldbe
            captors  since engaging the police
            in a gun battle on the streets of
            joplin missouri and slaying three
            of their number

                         blanche
            oh lord

we notice clyde is wincing

                         buck
            the barrow gang has been reported
            as far west as white city new
            mexico and as far north as chicago
            they have been credited with
            robbing the mesquite bank in the
            aforementioned white city the jj
            landry oil refinery in arp texas
            the sanger city national bank in
            denton texas on three different
            occasions  in addition to these
            robberies the fast travelling
            barrows have been rumored to have
            had a hand in the robbing of two
            piggly wiggly stores in texas and
            one a&p store in missouri though
            chief percy hammond who first
            identified clyde barrows brother
            buck as a member of the gang
            expressed some doubt that these
            last robberies were committed by
            the barrow gang alone

                         bonnie
            go on

                         cw
                   finally
            clyde we aint goin to see a
            restroom for another thirty miles
            why dont you just stop here

clyde looks relieved

                                                           56


ext wooded area  day

he pulls the car to a stop gets out and goes off into the
woods  we watch him vanish behind the trees

int car

buck still scanning the newspaper

                         buck
                   with a laugh
            hey now heres something!  listen
            here lone cop arrests two officers
            in hunt for barrow  police officer
            howard andersons heart turned
            faster than his motorcycle when he
            forced to the side of the road a
            roaring black v8 sedan in which
            were three men and a blondheaded
            woman yesterday afternoon

everybody laughs  as buck continues to read his voice
remaining on the soundtrack

ext car

the camera goes outside the car and pulls back way back to
reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car  the
car stops a good distance away and one man gets out the
only occupant of the car  he is tall dressed in the
uniform of the texas ranger  he draws his gun and slowly
approaches the car from the rear  on the soundtrack bucks
voice continues as we see all this taking place

                         buck
            when he saw several machine guns in
            the car he was certain hed caught
            clyde barrow bonnie parker and
            maybe buck barrow and the third
            unidentified member of the gang
            it took a lot of telephoning and
            explaining to convince the
            motorcycle cop that his captives
            were two highway patrolmen and a
            blondehaired stenographer from the
            highway patrol  haw!  haw!
                   everybody busts up
                   with laughter


in the meantime on screen the lawman is slowly approaching
the back of the car  suddenly cut to shot of clyde coming
out of the woods behind the lawman  his gun is tucked in
his pants  in a second he sees what is happening

                                                           57


bucks voice is continuing

                         buck
            anderson was held up as an example
            for every other texas peace officer
            today that was a mighty brave
            thing explained highway patrol
            chief lc winston

clyde whips out his gun  the following scene is played
exactly like a classic fastdraw in an heroic western

                         clyde
            sheriff!

bryce spins around  both men fire instanteously but clyde
has the draw on him and the aim  the gun goes flying from
the sheriffs hand  a really razzledazzle display of
grandstand marksmanship from clyde

immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the
man guns drawn

                         cw
            boy!  what a shot clyde!

                         buck
            sweet jesus i never seen shootin
            like that!

the gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt
clyde makes him lean on the cars hood arms extended legs
spread while he frisks him  in general everyone is
excited over the capture  bonnie takes the sheriffs gun
and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an
object dart

                         clyde
                   examining the mans
                   wallet really surprised

            custody of capn frank bryce and
            frank here is a texas ranger

rev angle across hoodso bryces face not visible to
clyde or anyone else behind him is in foreground  his
gnarled powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood as tho
they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper  his
eyes stare toward camera relentlessly unblinking but
without passion  they are sharks eyes  they have witnessed
much carnage devoured it and are still wide open for more

                                                           58

clyde grandly puts an arm on bryces shoulder bonnie
looking up admiringly from the other side  buck takes the
picture  bonnie immediately hops onto the hood next to
bryce

                         bonnie
            hows this captain bryce and new
            found friend

she coyly loosens his tie tousles his hair and plants a
big kiss on him while still ogling camera

                         clyde
            yeah yeahquick buck get
            it

                         buck
            im gettin it im gettin it

quite suddenly bryce whose simmering intensity we should be
more sensitive to than the gang is spits on bonnie  bonnie
halfscreams in disgust but clyde is on top of bryce in a
flash halfstrangling on his own fury  he pulls bryce off
the fender by the handcuffs spinning him around crazily
like a lasso  bryce is literally ricocheted off the car by
the force and with clyde hanging on by the cuffs plummets
down the embankment to the sandy beach below both men
falling spinning  bryce rises shakily  he tries to walk
away  clyde grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him
out into the water  bryce smacks into a tree stump poking
out of the shallows and goes down  clyde is on top of him

meanwhile buck has rushed down into the water tries to
pull clyde off bryce

                         buck
                   frantic
            i got the picture  i got the
            picture

                         clyde
                   oblivious
            lemme be lemme be

bryce reaches the surface and clyde tries to throw him into
deeper water  he hitches bryce over a moldy skiff knocking
aside one of the oars  buck upends bryce into the skiff and
kicks it spinning  clyde picks up an oar and hurls it like
a boomerang ass over end at the skiff  it kicks up a spray

                         buck
                   holding tightly to
                   clyde yelling
            i got the picture!

            we got youhear remember
            you your facewe got itwe
            got youwe got youwe got you

bryce battered and handcuffed stares back with mindless
malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical
spectre of clyde screaming his madness across the water

                                            dissolve

inside the bank  in contrast to the previous inept bank
robbery scene this one goes admirably well the gang
performing slickly and without a hitch  as they enter
dripping wet clyde makes a general announcement to everyone
to the bank

            nobody will get hurt

clyde covers the door  bonnie and buck go to the tellers
cages and get money  buck goes inside emptying out the
cash drawers  cut to bonnie filling the sack

cut to a closeup of a burglar alarm button  slowly a hand
crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the
button  when the finger is about one inch away suddenly a
gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away  the
camera pulls back to reveal buck smiling at a lady teller

                         buck

across the floor the bank guard in the corner takes
advantage of clydes distraction to go for his gun  clyde
spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guards
hat off without harming him

                         clyde
                   to the guard who
                   has practically
                   frozen in fear
            next time ill aim a little lower

they finish robbing the bank  they start to exit  near the
door stands a guard with his hands raised  he wears sun
glasses of the period  as they leave buck snatches the sun
glasses from the guards head

gaining on them and finally overtaking them coming up and
ahead forcing them to the side of the road

up their windows lock their doors and huddle together

ext road

the barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over
having a merry time  they surround the car and press their
faces against the window flattening their features making
menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside  we see this
from the point of view of the man and woman inside the car
clyde pulls out a gun makes as if to shoot but he is
kidding  they all laugh uproariously especially buck who
is delighted with clydes prank  all of this we see in
pantomime from inside the trapped car

ext car

                         clyde
            cmon get out!  get out of there

have practically turned to jelly

                         clyde
                   ordering them into
                   the other car

int other car  day

they get in and the gang gets in  seven people are now
jammed inside  clyde drives bonnie next to him cw next
to her  in back blanche then eugene with velma of
necessity sitting on his lap and then buck  as will be
seen the reason the barrows have kidnapped the couple is
simply that they wanted company  living as they do seeing
only each other day after day they long for diversion and
new faces  so the atmosphere in the car will shortly change
to one of friendliness and jollity and it will get
progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance
the time  as the car starts up at the beginning however
the man and woman are terrified

                         buck
            whats your name

            that there is clyde drivin and im

the man and woman almost faint from fear clutch at each
other  the gang all laugh at this  velma and eugene begin
to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the
barrows are friendly to them

                         bonnie

think is the right thing to say under the circumstances

int car  later

still driving same positions but some time has elapsed
the atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives
are enjoying their new friends  as the scene starts buck
is finishing his joke

                         bonnie
            so then she drinks her milk down
            again every drop  and she looks
            over at her son and says son
            whatever you do dont sell that
            cow!

the couple laughs with great amusement but everyone else in
the car doesnt laughthis is the tenth time theyve heard

it is now night  everyone inside the car is eating
apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food
in the crowded interior it is like a partyfood is being
passed back and forth laughter and gaiety increasing
warmth between the couple and the barrows  the car has
become a little society on wheels dashing through the black
night down the highway  inside there is a small world of
happiness and fun

buck is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks
around the car

                         velma

                   to fade
            im an undertaker

suddenly everyone freezes  a shudder as if the cold hand
of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car  the
atmosphere changes to cold deadly fearful silence in
exactly one second  it is a premonition of death for the
barrows and they react accordingly bonnie especially

                   tautly in a flat voice
            get them out of here

ext road  night

the car brakes to a sudden stop  the rear down is opened
the man and woman flung out into the darkness  the car
drives off into the lonely night

from this point on the audience should realize that death
is inevitable for the barrow gang that it follows them
always that it waits anywhere  it is no longer a question
of whether death will come but when it will

ext woods  morning

moving with clyde he tears through the brush snagging his
clothes calling bonnies name  clydes search is so
desperate here that for a moment we might think he is
fleeing from something rather than looking for something

in a moment he emerges onto the road  the car with cw
driving and buck and blanche beside him is patrolling
slowly up ahead of him

clyde spots it and runs toward it  hold on this angle until
he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board

                   paranoia as if the
                   three of them might
                   be withholding
                   something from him
            and nobody saw her leave or

cornfield knees pumping high knocking down the stalks  he
stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted takes it and
moves on

still another angle as clyde has picked up a freshly beaten
trail through the cornfield  he picks up one of bonnies
scarves now  as he runs on he clears a knoll and bonnie
her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance comes
into view  shes far off in the cornfield stalking off
looking neither to right nor left carrying a brown paper
sack that has split from which she has occasionally lost
clothing  clyde screams bonnie she apparently doesnt
hear

angle on cornfield  day  as clyde gets closer  bonnie
herself suddenly breaks into flight the paper bag splitting
completely the remaining clothes spilling out  there is a
real chase where they each try to get the advantage  clyde
is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble
cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn
finally clyde catches up

into the stalks of corn mowing them down

                   he turns to bonnie
                   who continues to
                   stare at her mother
            and i wouldnt risk bonnie here
            just to make money uncertain as
            times are  why one time i knowed
            of a job where we could of make
            $2000 easy but i saw the law
            outside and i said to myself why
            bonnie could get hurt here  so i
            just drove right on and let that
            money lay

he waits for a response as does bonnie  bonnies mother
smiles a little abstractedly

                         mother
            maybe you know the way with her
            then  im just an old woman and i
            dont know nothin

she trails off looking nowhere in particular  clyde takes
her reaction to mean that hes overwhelming her with his
confidence and continues to pour it on

                         clyde
            well be quittin this just as soon
            as the hard times is over mother
            parker i can tell you that  why
            me and bonnie were just talkin the
            other day and we talked about when
            wed settle down and get us a home
            and bonnie said i couldnt bear
            to live mornn three miles from my
            precious mother now howd you
            like that mother parker

bonnies mother has undergone a funny sort of transformation
during clydes speechas if something had suddenly come
into focus before the old womans eyes

                         mother
            dont believe i would  i surely
            dont
                   to bonnie
            you try to live three miles from me
            and you wont live long honey
                   to clyde
            youd best keep runnin and you
            know it clyde barrow

closeup of bonnie as her various relatives young and old
come by to squeeze kiss and hug her with a chirpy little

gives her a big raspberry waggling his fingers in his ears
like a kid  she laughs

                   eyes brimming
            oh baby ive got the blues so
            bad

clyde moves behind her begins to massage her back  there
is something very delicate about the way he touches her it
suggests clydes sensitivity to her mood rather than any
degree of physical intimacy

                         clyde
            bonnieis it your mama what
            your mama said

bonnie rolls over on her back stares up at clyde tears
splaying across her face from the move

                         bonnie
                   quietly
            so funnyi thought when we
            first went out we were really
            goin somewherebut this is it
            were just goin huh

she has addressed this last directly to clyde but there is
nothing rhetorical about itit is a real question  clyde
doesnt answer for a moment  then

                         clyde
            do you care about where were goin

bonnie clearly finds this hard to say

                         bonnie
            not as long as you care about me

                         clyde
                   quite simply
            why i love you sugar

its the first time hes said it to her and bonnie is
overwhelmed  she wraps her arms around clydes middle and
snuggles into him like a child  neither we nor clyde can
see bonnies face now and her voice is muffled by his chest

                         bonnies voice
            enough to die with me baby

her head lightly  really meaning it

as they approach four we should feel that somehow when they
shut their eyes they really will die  they shut them on
go and screen goes black

ext platte city motel  night

ranged across the lawn are six police cars loaded with
peace officers  four men come out and guns drawn walk
cautiously over to the room on the rightbuck and blanches

int platte city motel  bucks cabin  night

there is a knock on the door  they sit bolt upright in bed
before buck can say anything blanche puts her hand over his
mouth to shut him up

                         blanche
                   calling out
            the men are on the other side

ext platte city motel  night

the four lawmen among them the deputy from the cafe edge
their way across the lawn past the first garage past the
second  before they reach the door of bonnie and clydes
cabin the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire
one cop is hit and falls the others run back to the cars
for cover  bonnie and cw are at the window firing
steadily

clyderunning into the garage to get the car  they must
escape  all they can do is escape and all they have is
that one car in the closed garage

outside  two of the lawmen fall to the ground shot  as
the remaining two run back for cover we see a blinding
light rolling up in a space between the six cars  it is an
armored truck with mounted guns and and spotlight advancing
toward the cabin

inside the armored truck  two men in the seat  sounds of
gunshots coming from everywhere piercing light  from
inside the truck we suddenly see the windshield shattered
from bullets fired by bonnie and cw  the driver is hit
and he slumps over the wheel  his body hits the horn which
starts blasting and continues throughout the battle  the
other man quickly ducks under the dashboard for protection

inside the garage  clyde standing by the car  he holds the
browning automatic  the garage door is shaking from the
impact of bullets shattering  his gun already firing
automatic clip before he gets there  clyde in a crouch
runs to the garage door flings it up and runs back inside
the car  now the door is open and he can get the car out

                                                           93


one hand on the wheel one hand shooting he rolls the car
out onto the driveway  the battle is raging from all sides

ext street

the car stops  clyde keeps shooting  the door of the cabin
flies open and bonnie and cw come charging out guns
blazing away  cw  fires the thompson submachine gun
bonnie fires two pistols with automatic clips  they run in
a crouch tryingto get inside the car in front of their door
they make it

camera pans across the motel to the other door  it opens
buck and blanche come out holding a double bed mattress in
front of them for protection  this makes their running
awkwardthe mattress is heavy  blanche carries the front
end buck the back with one hand the other firing his gun
they get halfway to the car and then buck is hit shot in
the head  he falls to the ground blanche and the mattress
fall too since she has lost balance  both are under the
mattress

clyde dashes out of the car and drags buck into the back
seat  blanche follows hysterical  all guns on all sides
are still firing  they fling themselves into the car and
from a standing start the car starts out at 60 mph down the
driveway  one of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a
doublebarrele rifle but the car keeps coming about to run
him down  he jumps out of the way and fires at the side
the glass cracks and we see blanche fling a hand to her
face which is bloody  a piece of glass has lodged in her
eye  we hear her scream  the horn is still blasting

int the car swerving madly

clyde manages to keep it on the road  they drive away

ext street

the police run back to their cars to give chase calling out
to each other unable to believe that the gang could possibly
have gotten away

int car  night

as it is speeding down the highway  crazy mad hillbilly
music on the soundtrack  packed inside this car right now
is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed
it is hell in there hell and suffering and pain  the car
is a complete mess  cw is sobbing  everyone is hysterical
blanche is shrieking with pain and concern for buck  buck
is alternating between groaning and passing out completely
bonnie is yelling at everybody to shut up

                                                           94


only clyde driving with both hands clenched on the wheel
is silent  the car is doing 90

ext suburban street  night

the car from the outside a half hour later  they have
eluded the police  they are barreling down the road at top
speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes  it is
the middle of the night utter silence  clyde stops the
car points to ca car in a drivewayit is a beautiful
shiny new and expensive automobile  cw runs out runs up
the driveway peers inside gets in quietly backs it down
the driveway and pulls behind the gangs bulletriddled
getaway car  suddenly they both zoom off down the road
together

int of the new car  night

cw driving alone  he is crying mumbling wiping his eyes
and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the
other

ext ring of firs  night

a wide field in the country  this is dexter iowa  it is
quiet  we see in a long shot that takes in everything
that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees a dense
forest that circles them  the meadow however is large

the two cars drive into the middle of the field headlights
on  they stop and the barrow gang gets out  they are in
horrible shapewe can finally have a look at them  half
dressed in their pajamas bloody dirty in tatters  those
that can stagger out do so others are carried  a far shot
of all this

closer shot  moving closer to them we see clyde and cw
lay buck down on the ground  clyde begins to administer to
his wounds as best he can mostly just wiping him off  buck
is semiconscious  all are in a semidaze  blanche falls
to her knees still clutching her eyes  she is totally
hysterical

                         blanche
            oh god please help us!  dear
            father in heaven get us out of
            this and buck will never do another
            bad thing in his life!
                   she continues
                   moaning praying sobbing


bonnie walks over to the group looking at buck cw goes
over to her  two shotbonnie and cw

                                                           95

            he aint got a chance  half his
            head blown off

camera pulls back to take in blanche

                         blanche
            my eyes!
                   she screams
            god i think im blind
                   in the headlights
            light hurts so bad

bonnie walks over to the car and comes back with the
sunglasses buck had given blanche  moving her out of the
glare she helps blanche put them on  bonnie now has an arm
around blanche and blanche shivers into bonnie gracefully
bonnie is a little repelled by blanche but comforts her out
of genuine feeling for her

                         blanche
                   clinging
            please please get us to a doctor!
            tell clyde to get us to a doctor
            well die here

                         bonnie
                   helping with glasses
            here hon

bonnie looks silently up to clyde  clyde is looking dumbly
down at his mangled brother

                         blanche
                   going on
            clyde clyde please get us to a
            doctor

though blanche cannot see it clyde has knelt down to the
side of buck taking bucks hand and with his other hand has
begun smoothing bucks hair back away from the wound

                         blanche
            hes your brother!

                         bonnie
                   gently knowing
                   clyde will not and
                   cannot answer blanche
            buck cant be moved now hon

blanches answer to this is hysterical sobbing burying
herself into bonnie mumbling halfcoherent muffled prayers
between the sobs

                                                           96

                   he lapses into
                   unconsciousness again


clyde has begun to cry a little continues to smooth back
bucks hair with ritualistic regularity

wide angle  night  camera pulls away way back to wide
shot of the entire field showing the group in the center of
the darkness lit by the headlights

match dissolve into early dawn camera still on the wide
shot  the field is lighter though the trees still loom
blackly around it  the two cars one almost a shattered
wreck the other bright and shiny and new are parked in the
center  the sky is light but the trees cast a dark shadow
on the field  the gang is just sitting around  blanche
weeping next to buck cw sitting on the running board of a
car staring  bonnie standing and smoking  clyde still
with buck

all is quiet

ext woods  day

from the edge of the woods a man in a white shirt emerges
from behind a tree  the camera swings abruptly to get him
he calls out to the gang

                         man
            surrender!

it is a total surprise  bonnie clyde and cw all grab
their guns and fire several shots they are not firing the
big guns now but the pistols  the man lingers there for a
momenthe looks strange white luminous like an
apparitionand then he vanishes into the woods  silence
long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion

then there is a volley of gunfirea noise so large as to be
almost an impossible soundcoming from the woods all
around everywhere

                                                           97


a ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods
from every tree a puff of smoke  the camera pans in a
circle  behind every tree is a man with a gun  there are
at least 150 people out therepeace officers farmers with
hunting rifles kids with squirrel guns everyone who wanted
to come along and catch bonnie and clyde  their number is
so large because this time they want no possibility of the
gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes

from this point on the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled
on the sound track  we hardly hear them at allit is like
a dream

without a word all of the gang including the halfdead buck
making his final effort scramble for the nearest car  they
run throughout this battle crouched like animalstheir
only thought to get away to escape  to fight it out would
be ludicrous

from the moment the barrows start in motion there is
shooting again from the edge of the woods  we see them
scrambling towards the car in an extreme long shot
surrounded by the ring of smoke

med long shot of the car moving  the sound track goes to
complete silence  we see the car looking for an avenue of
escape  it veers towards a tree a man steps out from
behind the tree and fires the car jerks and veers toward
another tree again a man steps out and fires and so on
the car performs its eccentric dance all in utter silence
no sound of the motor nothing  the film should have the
feeling of slow motion as the car swerves and loops along
the edge of the woods  not once do any of the barrows fire
back  another man steps out and aims

sound partly up again but never at its realistic volume
from inside the smashed car we peer out the window across
the field and see the other car  the thought strikes the
audience at the same time it strikes the gangthey must get
to that car

med shot of the second car sitting in the field shining
in the sun  the lawmen also realize what must be donecut
off this escape  though bonnie clyde and the others are
heading toward it they suddenly train all their fire on the
car rather than the gang

the car fills the frame of the screen  bullets begin to hit
it  it starts to quiver under the impact  for the next
minute we see the car die in front of our eyes  we see the
beautiful machine fall to pieceswindows smash tires torn
apart body riddled  the death of the car is as painful to
watch as the willful death of a human being  the execution
is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the
destruction

ext woods

the camera pulls back way back and slightly above everything
to reveal the entire field  on the left of the screen
bonnie clyde and cw are scrambling toward the edge of the
woods  in the center buck and blanche have taken cover
behind a fallen log  in the foreground police begin to
emerge from the woods  the camera zooms rapidly in with
them toward buck  blanche is screaming

                         blanche
            dont kill him!  dont kill him!
            hes dying!

buck is making a last feeble attempt  the zoom continues
past buck until it comes tight on his hand a lawmans foot
steps on his hand  buck falls over  he dies  blanche
screams

                         blanche
            dont die daddy  dont die!

her and hold her as she writhes and cries  she is still
wearing the sunglasses

ext woods and stream  bonnie clyde and cw  day

they have reached the edge of the woods  camera tracks with
them as they run  from all around come the sounds of the
posse  the three get in through the pines and come finally
to a deep stream  they jump in and start across running
awkwardly in chestdeep water  they are half way across
when the police appear on the bank behind them shooting

closeup  bonnie  dayas she is struggling through the
water  a bullet hits her in the shoulder  we must see this
bullet clearly we must see it go in her flesh so that we
can feel it

tight closeup of bonnies face as she screams  it is the
first time she has been hurt and the scream is pure animal
pain  she cries out

ext stream and cornfield  day

clyde who has almost reached the other side comes back and
gets her  he drags her out of the water and into a cornfield
that starts growing on the opposite bank cw helping  he
halfcarries halfruns with her into the cornfield as the
field gets deeper and thicker

they stop for a second

                         bonnie
            baby no

but clyde has not heard this last  working on pure
adrenaline now he struggles onward  camera tilts up
slightly so we can see clyde as he essays his way toward a
farmhouse with a car in the distance  after a few moments
he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the
stalks as that sound too diminishes

both lie prostrate in the field listening  cw licks his
lips

                         bonnie
            shhh!

they wait for another long moment picking up only the
tiniest sounds

                         bonnie
                   finally
            oh no

                   thing in the world
            i cant die without clyde  i just
            cant

cw looks at her as if shes gone crazy  after another
moment the corn begins to tremble and we hear the os
sound of an approaching car

with cw daytentatively lifting his head up to clear the
corn stalks  with him we see the car looming larger
bearing down on us splitting the corn stalks  the car
finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of cw  bonnie
is on her feet and clyde tumbles out of the car practically
before its stopped sweeping bonnie into him  for a moment
both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of
the car simply holding onto each other and not moving

                         cw

trucks all loaded down with a number of poor families
seated around a campfire cooking  cw jams on the brakes
he gets out looking totally exhausted

sudden presence in their midst

                         cw
                   about to drop
            can yall spare me a little water

ext campsite  full shot

one man the leader of the group dips a cup of water and
approaches cw suspiciously  he comes close enough to make
cw reach out for the water but withholds it from him

            who are you boy

                         cw
            names moss

this seems to be enough for the man who gives him the water
as cw gulps it down the man begins to circle the car
peering into it suspiciously  suddenly he starts and his
eyes open wide

                         man

who have heard him begin to come over  without a word they
move quietly to the car and stare in

bonnie is out in the back seat clyde is semiconscious in
the front seat  he looks up through halfclosed eyes

we see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring
it to cw  he accepts it

a man rolls a cigarette and lights it  then very gingerly
as if afraid to really touch him he reaches through the
window and places it in clydes lips  it hangs there clyde
unable to drag on it or remove it

children peer through the back window

cw finishes his cup of soup  he hands it and the cup of
water back to a woman in the crowd

quietly moving together the okies step back  cw walks
to the drivers seat gets in and shuts the door  he starts
up the car

the people push a bit closer for a last look  clyde unable
to do more nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by
way of saying thank you t ot the people  the cigarette is
still dangling from his lips

the car moves off  a young boy pulls on his fathers shirt

malcolm moss cws father in arcadia louisiana  it
sits for a moment in the dark  then cw honks the horn
a few seconds pass and the porch light comes on  old man
moss comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness
he is a fat man with gray hair

greet each other hugging for a second looking each other
over

            god its good to see you boy!

he holds cw at arms length to study him and suddenly he
scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch

            cmon pa open the door

int sheriffs office in dexter  day

although the scene begins with a fullscreen closeup of a
newspaper clipping with a photo it is just a blurrygray
crowded scene of blanches capture  really impossible to
make anybody out in the crowd  camera stays on photo as we
hear voice over of two men talking a sheriff and his deputy

                         billy
            i was in the bunch that took er
            see here  can you make me out

                         pete
            sure enough billy is that your
            head there

camera pulls away billy a young deputycold intense
humorless and square carefully folds up the clipping and
puts it in his wallet

                         billy
            still cant figure how we let them
            other two get away

                         pete
                   an older more
                   genial type
            yeah seems as how nobody can get
            em somehow

                         billy
                   sullen
            yeahwell maybe this boyll be
            the one to do it this hamer guy
            boy if he cant do it sheriff
            aint nobody but the whole us
            army can do it

                                                          105


                         pete
                   with a new note of
                   enthusiasm gets up
                   and walks to the
                   windowturning to billy
            you hear he quit the rangers on
            account of texas got that woman
            governor  said he wouldnt work
            under no woman

                         billy
                   respectfully
            yeah thats somethin all right
            say how many they say he shot
            anyway in his day

                         pete
            sixtyfive they say

                         billy
            son of a seacook!

the door opens  we see full shot and then fast closeup
frank hamer  it should be a complete shock to the audience
this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially
destroyed by bonnie

hamer is dressed in his ranger outfit and hat and again he
has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner
his attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension
friendly only out of convention really superior and
contemptuous of lesser workers in his field

                         hamer
                   with politeness
                   arising from condescension
            excuse me am i in the right place
            is this sheriff smoot

pete and billy jump up from the chairs and walk over to
hamer hands extended  they are quite impressed by meeting
in the flesh

                         pete
                   mispronouncing his name
            frank hammer  i sure am pleased to
            meet you!
                   shakes his hand


                         hamer
            hamer

                                                          106


ext moss farm  close shot newspaper  day

a coil of rope snaps into and through the paper splitting
it and revealing cws startled face  clyde strides the
porch angrily snapping the rope

bonnie and malcolm are seated along with cw  through
bonnie has her arm supported by a sling and clyde has his
shoulder bandagedm it is evident by clydes heady indignation
and bonnies attentiveness that both are well on the way to
recovery

                         clyde
                   still snapping rope
            fled  what do they mean fled
            how in the nama god could i leave
            my brother to die when he was
            already dead when i left him
                   livid
            he was shot in too many pieces to
            pick off the ground!  fledwhat
            do they know the papers or the
            police

suddenly he moves upon malcolm with enormous intent as if
by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger
among them he will justify it all  malcolm momentarily
flinches then listens with intense deference

                         clyde
            why while we were all lyin around
            here near dead they had us
            holdin up the grand prairie
            national bank!  they hung that one
            on us just for luck i guess

clyde shakes his head still thinking this over  abruptly
to bonnie with deadly seriousness

                         clyde
            tell you what  soons we get well
            were gonna take that bank!

he breaks into a wicked grin but then reels catching
himself on the porch railing  hes obviously dizzy from
exertion and anger  bonnie startsthen sees clyde is in
control

                         clyde
                   remarking on his own dizziness
            whooooooo boy

                         bonnie

int moss house

they go into the house  camera goes with them  as soon as
they are out of earshot from bonnie and clyde malcolm turns
on cw displaying an entirely different demeanor from the
one he presented outside

                         malcolm
                   indicating tatto
                   which flutters
                   through cws open shirt
            you look like trash boy marked up
            like that  cheap trash

                         cw
                   protesting
            bonnie says it looks good

                         malcolm
            bonnie what does she know  shes
            just cheap trash herself  look
            what they do to you and you dont
            even get your name in the paper
            just pictures put on your skin by
            bonnie and clyde
                   more to himself

                         malcolm
            im just glad your ma aint alive
            to see that thing

cw peeks at it peering down at his chest trying to bring
the bluebirds into focus puzzled

                         cw
            i dont see whats so bad about it

int hospital  med shot of the room

seated in a soft chair looking directly at us is blanche
barrow  her eyes are completely covered with a white
bandage  she wears a hospital gown  the room is white and
bright

                                                          109


med shot  hamer in the doorway  the nurse leaves  he
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief
he puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice afraid she
will remember it from the kidnap  quietly almost on
tiptoes hamer walks over to blanche  he gets inches away
from her face  she still doesnt know he is there

                         hamer
                   quietly but
                   suddenly his voice
                   muffled by the handkerchief
            blanche barrow

she starts to her feet then adjusts to his presence  she
is a bit panicked  blanche is now a defeated human being
her voice and manner bespeak great weariness sorrow and
still a touch of her old highstrung hysteria  but most of
that is gone now like everything else that was really vital
in her life

                         blanche
            what  what  who is it

                         hamer
                   in a monotone a
                   relentless questioner
            you know your husbands dead

                         blanche
                   her voice flat and expressionless
            i know

                         hamer
            youre going to prison

                         blanche
            i know it

                         hamer
            wheres the rest of em

                         blanche
            i dont know

                         hamer
            wheres the rest of em

                         blanche

                                                          110


                         blanche
                   starting slow but
                   warming up to the
                   subject she begins
                   to talk and talk for
                   the sake of airing
                   her troubles
            i didnt mean to  i didnt  buck
            said we was just goin to visit we
            wouldnt be doin no robbin and
            stealin and then we went to
            joplin and all of a sudden they
            started shootin
                   hysteria begins to
                   creep into her voice
                   as she relives it all
            and we run off god i was scared
            and then it was run all the time
            and i wanted to go i begged to go
            but clyde and bonnie and cw

fade in

ext car on the moss farm  a dirt path near the barn  day

it is pouring rain middle of the afternoon bonnie and
clyde are inside the car sitting  they have lived so much
in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in
it rather than in a room  there they are themselves

int car

bonnie is in the back seat her legs wrapped in a plaid
blanket writing poetry  she looks like elizabeth barrett
browning  with one essential differenceher arm is in a
sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder  clyde is
in the front seat reading a newspaper  he is also partially
bandaged  on the dashboard is a box of gingersnaps which
he eats while he reads  they look domestic

                         clyde
            want a gingersnap bonnie

                                                          111


                         bonnie
                   busy absorbed
            no humumm
                   then she realizes
                   his nice gesture and
                   smiles warmly at him
            but thanks anyway clyde
                   she takes it all in
                   her situation and
                   looks content and cozy
            its real nice here just the two
            of us like this

                         clyde
                   more interested in
                   his paper
            uhhuh
                   something in the
                   paper catches his interest
            look here honey remember this

he holds up the paper there is one of the photos from the
motel the one showing bonnie smoking  she looks up at it
with mild interest

                         bonnie
            yeah at the motel

                         clyde
                   studying the picture

fragile the essence of herself  she is writing on a pad

                         clyde

                         bonnie
                   continuing
            okay here it is

closeup  bonnieas she reads intensely  at the beginning
of this montage the camera remains on her face  behind her
we see the rain on the window

                         bonnie
                   reading
            the story of bonnie and clyde

            youve heard the story of jesse
            james
            of how he lived and died
            if youre still in need
            of something to read
            heres the story of bonnie and
            clyde

            now bonnie and clyde are the barrow
            gang
            im sure you all have read
            how they rob and steal
            and those who squeal
            are usually found dying or dead

            they call them coldhearted killers
            they say they are heartless and
            mean
            but i say this with pride
            that i once knew clyde
            when he was honest and upright and
            clean

            but the laws fooled around
            kept taking him down
            and locking him in a cell
            till he said to me
            ill never be free
            so ill meet a few of them in
            hell

            the road was so dimly lighted
            there were no highway signs to
            guide
            but they made up their minds
            if all roads were blind
            they wouldnt give up till they died

                                            cut to

int police station  day

the manuscript is lying on the police blotter  hamer picks
it up and continues reading it  he reads it in a halting
way

                         hamer
            the road gets dimmer and dimmer
            sometimes you can hardly see
            but its fight man to man
            and do all you can
            for they know they can never be
            free

            from heartbreak some people have
            suffered
            from weariness some people have
            died
            but take it all in all
            our troubles are small
            till we get like bonnie and clyde

closeup of a newspaper page  the poem is printed all the
way down the length of one column  on the sound track
bonnies voice picks up the recitation

                         bonnies voice os
            if a policeman is killed in dallas
            and they have no clue or guide
            if they cant find a fiend
            they just wipe their slate clean
            and hang it on bonnie and clyde

int car  closeup of bonnie  day

the day is sunny and we see it through the car window  she
continues reading but now she reads it directly from the
newspaper

                         bonnie
            if they try to act like citizens
            and rent them a nice little flat
            about the third night
            theyre invited to fight
            by a subguns rattattat

            some day theyll go down together
            theyll bury them side by side
            to few itll be grief
            to the law a relief
            but its death for bonnie and clyde

                                                          114


bonnie finishes the poem as camera pulls back slightly to
show that it is a different day different clothes and the
bandages are gone  as she stops she has an expectant and
somewhat selfsatisfied look

closeup of clyde  his eyes are wide his mouth open his
face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a
giant laugh

                         clyde
                   in gleeful wonder
            damn!  thats me!

a great laugh comes bursting from him  camera widens to
take in bonnie  she is both startled and delighted by his
response

                   has made it that he
                   is the stuff of
                   legend that he is an
                   important figure
            a subguns rattattat!

he kisses her  she kisses back  they are chuckling
giggling  they grow more ardent they pull back and laugh
again  they begin to make love

ext arcadia street  ice cream parlor  day

bright afternoon  camera across the street from an ice
cream parlor  sign about it evas handpacked ice cream
a large plate glass window fronts the store and through it
we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths
prominent in our vision is malcolm moss seated facing
camera  he is seated across from another man but we see
him from the back

                                                          116


malcolm is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some
hard listening gesticulating and looking disturbed  after
a bit of this he rises from the table and begins walking
toward the door  the other man rises and turns  we now see
that it is frank hamer

malcolm and hamer come out onto the sidewalk squinting in
the sunlight  malcolm mimes some social pleasantries by way
of saying goodbye but hamers face shows no emotion of
recognition of the gesture  he turns and walks away
walking out of the frame

malcolm stands where he is in front of the ice cream parlor
by the expression on his face we can see that he is rather
disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling
with the problem

                                            dissolve to

bonnie and clyde  they lie where they were with one
differencethey are now wrapped in the blanket  clydes
pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base
of the blanket

                         clyde
                   chuckling apparently
                   quite pleased
            damn!damndamn!

he casts a sidelong glance to bonnie wanting some sort of
overt reaction from her  shes just smiling slightly
clydes underlying anxiety begins to surface

                         clyde
                   not looking at her
            hey listen bonnie how do you feel

                         bonnie
                   watching him
                   steadily her slight
                   smile growing
            fine

                         clyde
            i mean you feel like youre sposed
            to feel after youve uh

                         bonnie
            just

                                                          117


                         clyde
                   doesnt know what
                   the fuck to say
                   desperately wants her approval
            well thats good aint it
            reason i ask is i uh well i
            figger its a good idea to ask  i
            mean how else do i tell if i did it
            the way

                         bonnie
                   stopping him with
                   great warmth
            hey  you done just perfect

clyde looks at her for the first time tremendously relieved
he can see she means it  now his buoyancy utterly
unchained breaks through

                         clyde
            i did didnt i  i mean i did i
            really did  i did it i did i
            mean this was my first time and it
            was just like rollin off a log
            when it comes right down to it it
            was easy i mean i didnt even have
            to try

lovingly laughing altogether overwhelmed with himself
clyde pulls bonnie into him  he kisses her wants to make
love again but then pulls back and keeps chattering at
sixty miles a minute  hes waited twentythree years to
talk about this and hes got the perfect audience

                                            dissolve to

int kitchen  moss farm  twilight

after dinner  there are four empty plates but only cw
and malcolm in the kitchen  cw is scraping the bottom of
a wilted evas handpacked ice cream carton  malcolm
studies his sons quiet intensity in this direction for a
moment then moves very close whispers when he speaks

                         malcolm
                   whispering
            boy they expect you to go downtown
            with em tomorrow

                         cw
                   out loud licking
                   his ice cream
            who

                                                          118


                         malcolm
                   raising his own
                   voice infuriated by
                   his sons obtuseness
            bonnie and clyde!
                   he slaps the carton
                   out of cws hands
                   whispering again
            bonnie and clyde

                         cw
            sure i always go with them

malcolm thinks hard about this

                         malcolm
            better go then you better go
            better go
                   forcing cw to sit
                   at table
            but when they get back in the car
            to come on home dont get in with
            them

                         cw
                   genuinely puzzled
            why daddy

                         malcolm
            you just listen to your pa fer once!
            caint you do that  im yore
            daddy im your kin not clyde

                         cw
                   still confused
            well what should i tell em i
            cant get back in the car with you

malcolm is ready to killhis sons obtuseness and his fear
of clyde is whipping him into a quiet frenzy

                         malcolm
                   squeezing cws arm
            no you tell them nothin hear
                   hesitates then
            i made a deal and got you off with
            a coupla years!

                         cw
                   a piercing treble
            made a deal with who daddy

                                                          119


malcolm hauls off and whacks cw across the top of his head
with the flat of his hand then momentarily holds his hand
over cws mouth

                         malcolm
                   we can see his own fear
            the law  just dont get back in
            that car
                   eyeball to eyeball
            and whatever you do dont let onto
            them hear

cw suddenly smiles as if he knew something

                         cw
                   expletive
            whew! you think them laws are
            gonna catch bonnie and clyde in town

cw returns to the ice cream cartonmalcolm lets him
figuring he better find out what he can

                         malcolm
            what do you think clarence

                         cw
                   matter of fact
            they aint gonna catch em  dont
            matter whether i let on or not

                         malcolm
                   playing along
            mebbe  just you be offn the
            streets of that town when they go
            to get in their car

                         cw
                   looking directly at malcolm
            nobody catches clyde  clydes got
            a sense dont you know that daddy
            nobody catches clyde

malcolm knows better but for just a moment he stares at his
son fearing that maybe cw for all his limitations has a
sense about clydes sense  cw has finished with the
carton and crumples it licking the last remnants of cream
off his fingers

int bedroom  moss farm  night

bonnie and clydes bedroom the middle of that night  both
are wide awake lying on opposite sides of the double bed
both are staring into the night disquiet

                                                          120


                         clyde
                   suddenly
            bonnie  bonnie will you marry me

there is a silent gasp from bonnie a barely perceptible
stiffening  then she talks in a voice falsely formal still
staring up at the ceiling

                         bonnie
            how could i do that clyde  you
            know its impossible  wed have to
            go to a justice of the peace and
            the justice of the peace is a
            lawman  we couldnt even take out
            a license

                         clyde
                   with a chuckle
            hey now you sound like you been
            givin it some thought on your own

                         bonnie
                   with a grim irony
                   her voice getting
                   more and more emotional
            oh no i never gave it thought  i
            havent thought about it at least
            ten times a day i havent thought
            about it every minute of my life
            since i met you
                   suddenly her voice
                   cracks into tears


she flings herself violently across the bed and buries
herself into clydes chest her knees drawn up her head
tucked down into him her body shaking with sobs

                         clyde
                   a bit startled by
                   this attempting to
                   hold her awkwardly
                   and placate her  he
                   puts his arm around her
            bonnieare you crying honey

bonnie nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears

                         bonnie
                   her face still
                   buried in clydes
                   chest she whispers
            clyde why do you want to marry me

                                                          121


clyde thinks a minute and then grins

                         clyde
                   in an attempt to be humorous
            to make an honest woman out of you

bonnie is silent

                         bonnie
                   finally in a voice
                   charged with
                   anticipation and dream
            clydewhat would you do what
            would you do it some miracle
            happened and we could walk out
            tomorrow morning and start all over
            again clean with no record with
            nobody after us

clyde thinks about it a minute

                         clyde
            welli guess id do it all
            different  first off i wouldnt
            live in the same state where we
            pull our jobs  wed live in one
            state and stay clean there and
            when we wanted to take a bank wed
            go to another stateand

suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he
could have that it was not the answer bonnie wanted to hear
he looks down at her his voice anxious

                         clyde
                   continuing
            bonnie

she is silent

                         clyde
            hey bonnie

but she does not answer

ext roadside  early morning

we see malcolm jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck
which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area

                         bonnie
            he stopped off in that hardware
            store to get light bulbs for his
            daddy

clyde opens the door of the drivers seat and sits down

                         clyde
            sure why not

he reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses
as he goes to put them on one of the lenses falls out

                         clyde
            damn!

he puts them on

                         bonnie
                   laughing
            you gonna wear em

                         clyde
            sure drive with one eye shut

bonnie gets in the car rummages around in one of the bags
and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper  she
unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard displaying it
it is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her
hand worth about thirty cents

                                                          123


                         bonnie
                   admiring it
            isnt that the prettiest thing hon
            just look here you can see every
            little fingernail on her hands

she shows him

                         clyde
            it is a pretty thing honey

clyde turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music
they are singing little church in the valley  he beats
time on the steering wheel getting a little impatient
bonnie puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the
grocery sack

                         bonnie
            we got any peaches  i sure could
            go for a peach right now

she burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach  she
takes a big bite  the juice drips down the side of her
mouth  she looks beautiful

                         clyde
                   he stops drumming
                   his fingers suddenly
                   has an idea
            whynt we do it tomorrow

                         bonnie

            tomorrows sunday aint it  we
            could drive all night and be on
            that golf course tomorrow morning!

                         bonnie
            you sure you feel up to it

                         clyde
                   enthused
            yeah why not
                   now feeling anxious
                   and excited he is
                   impatient to move
            where is that boy  hes gone too
            long

                                                          124


                         bonnie
                   humming to the radio
            hell be here
                   holding the peach to him
            you take a bite hon

                         clyde
                   getting worried
            no its takin too long  what if
            something happened

                         bonnie
            nothin happened

                         clyde
                   more urgently
            go take a look see whats keepin
            him

not too delighted with the chore bonnie goes off  we
remain with clyde getting anxious  the music plays on
bonnie comes back hurriedly now anxious herself

                         bonnie
            he aint there

clyde jumps into action slams his door

                         clyde
            cmon lets go

bonnie gets in  they drive off

int store  closeup cw  day

hiding inside a store peering out through a curtained
window at them driving away  his expression is disturbed
his face half in shadow

ext road  day

bonnie and clydes car coming down the road  camera sees
from clydes pov  malcolm standing in the road waving
him down  the pickup truck its back jacked up is parked
beside him on a shoulder of the road

int car  day

                         bonnie
            whats wrong

                         clyde
            i dont know

                                                          125


ext road

clyde reaches the spot pulls off the road and stops the car
he gets out  camera pulls back  clyde talks to the old
man bonnie stays in the car  cut to a shut down the trench
of the law tense

suddenly a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the
road from the opposite direction  hamer sees it from a long
way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything
pass between him and his quarry  he decides the time is now
he leaps up from the trench and yells at clyde

                         hamer
            barrow!

the old man dives under his truck to hide  the shooting
starts

we see the chicken truck  two men in the front seat  they
see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and in
terror they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck
they run as fast as they can into the meadow away from the
trouble

the gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires
eightseven shots at bonnie and clyde giving them absolutely
no chance  the sound is rapid deafening

at no point in the gun fight do we see bonnie and clyde in
motion  we see instead two still photographs cut into the
sequence one of clyde half out of the car taking careful
dead aim with his gun just as he did in the teaching scene
one of bonnie in terror a pack of cigarettes in her hand
clutched tight looking as fragile and beautiful as she can
be

the noise stops at once  utter silence  it has been a
massacre  bonnie and clyde never had a chance to return the
gunfire  we see the car a complete shambles  we never see
bonnie and clyde dead though for a moment we discern their
bodies slumped in the car

the camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with
the opposite side of the road  then slowly the six lawmen
stand up in the trench  on the faces of the five deputies
horror and shock at what they have just done  hamer
however registers no emotion  his face is a blank  he
lights a cigarette  slowly slowly the five men begin to
edge closer to the car to see the result  music the wild
country breakdown music begins on the sound track

                                                          126


before they reach the car the camera swings away from them
past them and zooms out and above into the meadow where the
two truck drivers are standingtiny distant figures

the truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera coming
back to the road to see what happened  they get closer and
closer to the camera until they have reached a middle
distance and as they continue to walk at us it is

                           the end

                                            cut to black
