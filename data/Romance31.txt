          dusk or night has only barely fallen

          

          

          

          
          a huge clock marks 755 pm the clock belongs to some landmark
          building to be determined immediately following the building goes
          dark

          establishing shot of the eiffel tower lit suddenly all the lights
          go out

          the same thing happens with the granadas alhambra sevilles giralda
          tower the guggenheim at bilbao the gate of alcala all these well
          known architectonic wonders turn dark abruptly beauty that
          disappears suddenly beauty thats extinguished and envelops us in
          darkness

          

          

          

          

          1 harry caines home int night


          

          
          harry fifty years old sits as if he were waiting without hurry
          immobile and patient in his study next to his desk as if it were the
          thing keeping him company he isnt doing anything he lets time
          take its course his silence is broken by the sound of footsteps that
          come and go at first we cant see who the footsteps belong to until
          they stop

          in the living room a few meters from harry judit stops she too
          is shrouded in darkness she looks at her wristwatch the second hand
          moves from left to right on the watch face judit fortyeight looks
          younger breathes impatient she is dressed soberly in a dignified
          and practical manner

          

          
          she approaches a window that looks out onto the street everything
          outside is also in darkness the building in front is just a dark
          mass she looks to the end of the street almost all the buildings
          visible from the window are dark the gate of alcala in the background
          is also not lit without turning she says to harry

          

          

           judit
           the door of alcala has also darkened

          

          
          harry is still sitting inert absorbed by his thoughts the whole
          house is in darkness only the ambient clarity of the night comes
          through the windows curtains drawn back

          judit heads slowly toward the kitchen on the wall there is a vitra
          clock to which she gives a cursory glance
          she turns on the faucet and fills a glass of water from her pocket
          she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in
          silver she opens it she grabs a small pink pill she takes it
          she glances once more at the stylized design of the vitra clock the
          minute hand nears 8 pm
          on a windowsill or on the kitchen table there is an open newspaper
          the exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global
          warming an international date has been convened for a five minute
          blackout at 8 pm

          

          
          standing in the kitchen judit poised and tense looks up at the spot
          where the clock is the stillness of all the elements comprising the
          frame make it seem like a painting she waits until the seconds hand
          completes its cycle and its 8 oclock sharp
          swiftly judit powers the central electrical switchboard which is in
          the kitchen the kitchen lights up the refrigerator emits its
          characteristic sound the lamps in the living room also light up
          lowhanging lamps that make the light bounce the house is awash in
          a special luminous atmosphere Â­ dense translucent with darkened
          zones all the furniture is flush with the walls there are some
          paintings hanging and a rug on the ground everything is of the kind
          of quality that denotes good personal taste

          

          
          upon the lights return judit exhales a profound sigh of relief
          she moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and
          contemplates how in the building across the way the windows begin to
          blink in square patterns of light

          

          

          

          

          2 flashback 1994 lanzarote hospital int day


           4

          
          the lights return is contagious a true spectacle which ends with a
          blinding light that floods the screen
          it will probably be a closeup of the sun

          

          
          that very sun enters through another window which is not that of
          harrys house nor that of the building across the way it is the
          window of a hospital room perhaps a sign should specify that the
          following scene occurs fourteen years earlier

          

          
          the hospital is on lanzarote island in the canary islands the scene
          occurs fourteen years earlier the characters are the same harry
          and judit
          harry lies in bed his head completely bandaged sunlight enters
          through the window
          judit is seated on the bed she holds his hand and pleads worried
          and loving

          

          

           judit
           mateo say something!

           mateoharry
           mateo is dead

           judit
           sweet and devastated dont say that!

          

          
          the character to whom judit refers as mateo the same one that in the
          previous scene we have called harry has a recent wound either on
          his arm or on his hands along with his head which is completely
          covered by bandages

          

          
          mateo and harry are the same person the difference is the fourteen
          years that separate them harry in the present 2008 is fifty

           5

          
          years old in 94 the time period when the flashback takes place he
          was thirtysix lets say that when he was thirtysix harry was
          called mateo the character has two names which his own voiceoff
          explains while we observe what his daytoday consists of in 2008

          

          

           off harry
           i always wanted to be another person to be someone
           beside myself to dispose of a single identity didnt
           seem enough living a single life wasnt enough for
           me and halfjoking i came up with a pseudonym for
           myself harry caine an adventurer who as fate would
           have it became a writer at that time i had him
           author all the scripts and stories that i wrote i
           came up with a standard biography to fill the back
           flap of his books he had been a sailor an
           industrial spy the doorman at a parisian cabaret a
           boxer a waiter and an advertisement handdouble a
           selfmade man active and attractive like an english
           spy vital skeptical and sarcastic for many years
           mateo blanco and harry caine shared the same person
           me but a time came when all of a sudden i couldnt
           be anyone other than harry caine i became my
           pseudonym he applies lotion in front of the mirror
           we first see him in front of it and then doubled
           reflected in it then suddenly the mirror does not
           reflect him of his two identities he only has one
           left just as i had planned a heterodox writer and
           never better stated a selfmade man one might even
           say selfwritten man there was only one detail i
           had not foreseen harry would be a blind writer

          exercising
          he takes a shower mateo blanco and harry caine shared the same
          person me but a time came when all of a sudden the camera
          pans over various parts of his body under the running water dense
          waves of white foam slide down his skin as if it was a landscape
          the hangers have braillestickers that indicate the characteristic of
          the clothing they hold all the closets have sliding doors
          in his bedroom he opens the closet and looks for the clothes he will
          wear despite the fact that he cannot see himself he stands in front
          of a mirror he smiles pleased with his appearance 
          everything in the house is rigorously ordered all that harry needs
          to ascertain the identity of the things around him is his touch
          he exits onto the street

          he reaches the opposite sidewalk the credits appear on the black and
          white stripes that mark the crossing the crossway is clear of
          pedestrians so that only cars pass through not many and as they do

          they run over the letters of the credits making them disappear in
          pieces on a different stripe a new title appears and as it does it
          is run over and destroyed by another car like this successively

          just on the sidewalk across from where harry lives there is a news
          stand and next to it perhaps on the nearest corner a bar
          harry buys the newspaper at the newsstand this is part of his daily
          routine he greets the attendant familiarly he has the kind of face
          that provokes pity he grabs the newspaper folds it and places it
          under his arm

          he enters the bar he leans down somewhere on the bar table just as
          soon as he sees him he is approached by his waiter friend an
          approachable guy somewhere in his forties who is helped by a south
          american waitress wearing her makeup since the early part of the
          morning whom he is obviously screwing he brings him a coffee all
          of these actions are part of a daily ritual

          

          

           waiter friend

          harry exits the bar and becomes immersed in the different noises of
          the street the passersby their different sounds and corporeal odors
          auditory life the camera swirls around his head at first he hears
          all the noises indistinctly mixed and then he begins to separate
          them he selects one he likes the rest of the sounds of the street
          disappear or their volume is lowered girls cars high heels the
          smells of different ethnicities a multiracial street harry
          selects an odor the body of a woman whose aroma appears and
          disappears harry follows it having also singled out the sound of
          her heels he loses them he finds them again

          

          
          he walks selfassuredly without tripping either on the urban
          furniture or the people he leans lightly on his umbrella which he
          uses as a cane at first glance he doesnt appear blind 

          

          
          he reaches a pedestrian crossing nearby he recognizes the odor
          which had attracted him he follows its trace until he reaches the
          sidewalk the odor emanates from a young girl just next to him
          waiting before the crosswalk harry searches with the tip of the
          umbrella until he brushes her shoe he excuses himself as if the
          contact had been inadvertent the girl regards him harry then takes
          one step forward intent on crossing the street the cars come very
          close to him almost running him over a real sense of danger the
          light is red for pedestrians the girl takes him by the arm pulling

          her measurements she smiles she knows them by heart
          she describes herself the color of her eyes her hair her skin
          how shes dressed while she traces over him with her glance when she
          speaks of her eyes we see his eyes when she speaks of her mouth we
          see his etc her gaze stops at harrys crotch harry can feel her
          watching him the situation seems perfectly natural

          

          
          harry approaches her he knows shes right in front of him with his
          hands he places a brief caress on each of the parts the girl has just
          described the eyes the hair the mouth he lowers his hands until
          they fall spread on her breasts it is as though the blind man
          could gaze at her with his fingers and palms he rests his head on

          someone is opening it
          harry rises before he arrives to the foyer the door is already
          open in the middle of the doorway a woman judit the same one who
          had been with him during the blackout of the opening sequence
          harry finishes tucking his shirt barefoot judit closes the door
          slowly and surveys him up and down with inquisitive eyes which he
          cannot see but one could say that he can guess he smiles

          

          

           judit

          the sound of a running faucet emerging from the bathroom distracts
          judit first the sound then the immediate appearance of the girl
          both women look at each other and are surprised despite their attempt
          to hide it judit appears more annoyed than surprised after a very

          judit fortyeight years old seems younger is dressed in an informal
          and sober manner little color etc her hair is pulled back parted
          in the middle her attitude is that of a guardian she puts away the
          key to the door while she gazes sternly at the young woman
          the girl very uncomfortable quickly vanishes

           sullen and ironic everything awful thats had to
           happen to me has now all thats left is for me to
           enjoy life   

          

          
          judit changes the topic so that harry may also change his tone she
          turns off the table lamp and she opens the window drapes that lead to
          the terrace

          

          

           judit
           diego told me yesterday that you finished the script

           harry
           i would like to add a final epilogue it may not be
           necessary but id like to write it

           judit
           i agreed to deliver the definitive version to the
           producer and director today

           harry
           you will have it by tomorrow dont worry

          

          
          as he speaks harry has made his way back to the sofa without the use
          of a cane he knows by heart the landscape of the house which he
          walks through as if he could see if anything he touches any given
          piece of furniture with the tip of his fingers as if to ascertain
          whether its still there he walks both with ease and with the
          characteristic rigidity of blind people

          

          

          

          

           15

          
          he picks up the socks from the floor and slips them on the newspaper
          is open on the floor he puts his shoes on judit watches him for a
          moment and then turns toward the window

          

          

          

          

          13 judits point of view the sidewalk across the way harrys

          street ext day


          

          
          she observes how on the sidewalk across the way the girl enters the
          main door of the building just next to the newsstand where harry buys
          his newspaper from the window she can make out that its an
          important modeling agency

          

          

          return to seq 12

          

          
          judit is still looking out the window her back to harry when she
          hears him say

          

          

           harry
           ernesto martel has died

          

          
          judit turns to harry surprised but masking it with her voice

          

          

           judit
           i think he was very ill

           harry
           its been so long since weve spoken of him!

          

          
          judit nods plainly with her head silence ernesto martels death
          doesnt bring good memories to either of them

          

          

          

          

           16

          

          14 harrys home int day continued


          

          
          the doorbell rings its diego judits son who doubles as harrys
          typist and coscriptwriter he is a special kid twentyfive years
          old baggyeyed a weary aspect but he overflows with charm
          dresses as a modern kid but not obnoxiously so he speaks
          delicately an attitude uncommon for someone his age
          he greets his mother

          

          

           judit
           you look awful !

           diego
           i ran here

           harry
           and its monday! diego you dont have to run for me
           we are not in a hurry

           judit
           i am ive committed 

           harry
           youll have it by tonight dont worry

           judit
           start thinking of the next script some kind of
           horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers its
           what sells best 

           harry
           i dont know if ill know how to i was thinking of
           developing a story inspired by arthur millers son

           judit
           perplexed the writer who married marilyn

           harry

          

          

           17

          
           yes after marilyn he married the photographer inge
           morat and they had a son he was born mentally
           handicapped and arthur miller hid him he doesnt even
           mention him in his memoirs he never recognized him
           publicly from the moment he was born he had him
           placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of
           him despite his condition the boy was able to learn
           and to make an almost normal life for himself he
           lived in an apartment with other friends and he found
           a job as a clerk in a supermarket

          

          
          judit looks at him perplexed for some reason harry has his back
          turned this happens many times

          

          

           judit
           and miller never saw him 

           harry
           continues his back turned one day miller was
           giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded
           man who had been condemned to death after what was
           believed to be a forced confession among those
           present was his mentally handicapped son who was
           integrally involved with organizations that aided all
           sorts of disabled people the son was very proud to
           finally be sharing something with his father at the
           end of the conference he approached the stage and
           held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless
           to arthur miller who did not know how to extract
           himself from this mentally handicapped man imagine
           it would not have been politically correct least of
           all given the situation in which miller found himself
           then the stranger let go of him and told him i am

           18

          
           your son daniel and i am very proud of you father!
           this was the only time father and son saw each other

          

          
          judith listens affected and disoriented she looks at her son as if
          she were looking for help diego stops thumbing through a magazine in
          order to listen to harry and to witness his mothers reaction she
          wasnt ready for harry to counter with such a shocking narrative

          

          

           judit
           somewhat tense its very moving but i dont think
           we can write a script about arthur miller without
           procuring rights from the family

           harry
           we change the names the story is not about the
           writers miserliness but about the strength of the
           son who survives without the least bit of rancor
           toward the father who has ignored him his entire life
           it is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent
           goodness there arent those many good men that one
           can write about

          

          
          judit would like to say that when she spoke of a commercial script
          this is not what she had in mind but she doesnt want to come off
          rude diego keeps watching them her mother appears oddly cornered
          until she remembers a past comment of harrys that suits her just

          right

          

          

           judit
           its a beautiful story but years ago when you began
           writing again and i began selling your scripts you
           told me youd never write remakes sequels nor
           biopics nor stories whose protagonists were film

           19

          
           directors handicapped or blind i remember clearly
           because the part of the biopics surprised me

           smiles

           harry
           i cant bear them as if he had at that very moment
           remembered its true its true i said all that but
           this wouldnt exactly be a biopic

          

          
          they hear the doorbell ring two or three times for judit its the
          best way to escape the conversation

          

          

           judit
           ill get it

          

          
          diego settles on the armchair in front of his laptop on the other
          side of the table sits the computer that is specially programmed for
          harry diego powers his laptop harry heads for the work table and
          he sits in front of diego

          

          

           harry
           diego go to the end of the document

          

          
          diego obeys while we hear judit approaching the door and before she
          opens it someone opens it from the other side we see the documents
          text a script scrolling fleetingly over diegos computer screen

          

          
          at the door judit finds mariacruz the latin american maid who also
          has her own key to the house she is carrying two shopping bags
          judit gives her some directive about the windows the curtains the
          kitchen furniture the food the floors things to be dry cleaned 
          etc and she leaves saying goodbye to harry and diego with a simple
          boys im leaving goodbye!

          diego chooses a track that functions as background music to the three
          night sequences that follow although its not absolutely necessary
          he works at a modern bar not very large as a dj he spends most
          of the time inside a small booth which only a few friends access
          alex his same age enters

          can be heard spoken by a very unpleasant synthetic voice his search
          produces annoying and strange sounds harry continously makes
          mistakes but thats the way to do it
          he manages to get into el pais the obituary section he listens to a
          list he finally finds the news of ernesto martels death he listens
          to the headline

          

          
          the sound of a mobile phone ringing interrupts him

          in front of judit on the other side of the table full of papers is
          the head of production and someone from the american production they
          are trying to decide on the budget
          from the ashtrays full of cigarettes the bottles of water and the
          cups of coffee one assumes that they must have been at this task for
          many hours one should be able to see the layout of the shooting
          schedule something visual the american production can be heard in
          the background
          seq 16 and 17 run in parallel

           22

          
          harry touches the small mp3 much easier than to listen to the digital
          newspaper he doesnt want to tell her that he is attempting to
          listen to ernesto martels obituary so he tells her what he will be
          doing next

          

          

           harry

          in her early thirties lena is dressed soberly almost excessively so
          as if she were attempting to project a maturity effectiveness and
          responsibility that she not yet possesses she is a very beautiful
          woman on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its

          lips and another one on the top edge of the nose she could do more
          with her physique modernize it but this is not what she aims for
          her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the american film noir

          translucent beauty of gene tierney and the bored disdain of linda

          its a hot and sunny afternoon at the end of july lena arrives
          inside a taxi to the entrance of puerta de hierro hospital on the
          sidewalk next to the entryway her mother awaits chubby tired
          defenseless and impatient shes around sixty next to her a suitcase
          and a huge plastic bag full of clothes the mother is a smalltown
          woman dignified and beaten the shock provoked by the situation has
          liberated her if only momentarily from falling into desperation

          

          
          through the cars window lena can see her mother on the sidewalk and
          her ailing father a man in his sixties very debilitated and aged
          sitting on a sofa in the foyer

          

          
          lena tells the cabdriver to wait and runs toward her mother they
          kiss

          

          

           lena

          the mother gestures for them to get away from the door that way the
          father cannot see them

          

          

           mother

           i couldnt explain on the phone she recounts dr
           de la torre called us for an appointment i though it
           would be to tells us that they were finally going to
           operate on your father but instead he tells us they
           are releasing him in disbelief i asked him what
           he meant and he replied quite simple its july and
           i am leaving for my vacation as her story moves
           forward the mother relives the same states of mind
           that she went through in her conversation with the
           doctor and i told him you are throwing us out onto
           the street and he insisted without the least bit
           of compassion i am releasing him so that you can go
           home but what can i do with him at home in his
           condition thats your problem he told me she
           cries do whatever you like i am leaving on
           vacation he is dying! i begged well let him
           die in peace at home he said to me

          

          

           lena
           powerless furious it cannot be! they cant keep
           him for twenty days torturing him with tests in
           preparation for an operation and now leave him like
           this just because the doctor is leaving on vacation!

          

          
          the mother looks at her without knowing what to say she takes a
          small handkerchief to her nose

          

          

           lena
           have you protested

           mother
           to who dr de la torre is the head surgeon there
           is no one over him

           29

          
          lena refuses to accept the situation
          the father appears through the doors of the hospital entrance
          exhausted he leans down to catch his breath with a weak voice
          almost inaudible he says to them

          

          

           father
           did you forget about me

          

          
          lena and the mother approach him almost jubilant hiding their sense
          of helplessness and frustration

          

          

           lena
           her eyes welled up with tears she gathers her last
           bit of strength how could you think that dad!

          

          
          between the two women they help the father to the taxi that is waiting
          for them nearby they put him in the car the man can hardly walk
          he is very thin his bones jut out from under his ashen skin he
          walks crouched over
          the taxi pulls off

          the taxi parks in front of a humble building in one of those outlying
          neighborhoods in the periphery of madrid a commuter town children
          women street ambience its like a provincial town transported to a
          huge city that is in the midst of merciless development at that hour
          there are few people on the street

          

          
          the passage between this sequence and the next happens through the

          from the previous night

           from puerta de hierro yesterday

          

          
          ernesto changes his tone now he is an allpowerful man generous and
          with every recourse at his fingertips

          

          

           ernesto

          night before it is present on both of their minds

          one of the hospitals hallways
          the mother lena and ernesto are waiting together on a row of chairs
          next to a door dr blasco emerges an eminent surgeon specialist
          an impenetrable man he doesnt mince words getting information from
          him is like pulling teeth he is polite but not accommodating in the
          slightest

          

          

           ernesto
           hows the patient

           surgeon
           you have brought him in terrible conditions which i
           suppose you know

          

          
          the mother affirms with a gesture

          

          

           ernesto
           with good manners but authoritarian will you be
           able to save him

          

          

           40

          

           surgeon
           we will do everything possible at this very moment
           it is impossible to operate

          

          
          lena and the mother look at both men anxiously

          

          

           surgeon
           perhaps tomorrow we are providing parenteral
           nutrition he will need a blood transfusion
           looks at both women do you have any relatives who
           can donate

           lena
           well here i dont know

          

          
          the mother also doesnt know what to say

          

          

           ernesto
           give him the best blood youve got!

           surgeon
           i will keep you updated on his condition in the next
           hours he says goodbye to them

           mother
           may i stay

           surgeon
           yes of course you can stay in his room as long as
           you wish

          

          
          the mother is not accustomed to so many privileges
          the doctor says goodbye to ernesto martel and the women mechanically

           41

          
          when the three are alone the mother thanks ernesto martel for what he
          has done for them she looks at her daughter in a knowing way as if
          she understands and accepts what else can she do! the situation

          

          

           lena
           ill stay here mom you have to rest

           mother
           with strength but beaten no you rest youve
           already done enough thank you very much mr ernesto
           if my husband survives it will be thanks to you

           ernesto
           he will survive maam

           lena
           really you dont want me to stay or that i bring you
           something

           mother
           no go you both must have things to do

          

          
          lena complies in effect there is something urgent she must do pay
          the price for all those privileges to pay the cost of her fathers
          life
          ernesto and lena walk to the other end of the hallway before she
          enters the room the mother bids farewell to them with a look thats
          sad tired but of fortitude
          the two figures slowly recede down the hallway until they disappear
          in a
          fade to black

          completely dark harry moves with his characteristic naturalness
          he is coming from the bathroom his hair wet and wearing a robe
          he feels around until he finds the peephole he opens it and reaches
          his eye toward it as if he could really see the person on the other
          side he is not waiting for anyone so he hopes the visitor will
          think he is watching even if he cant see a thing

          

          

           harry
           from inside who is it

          

          
          a voice on the other side of the door responds

          

          

           ray x

          ray does not move neither does harry they both remain still and
          mute on their respective sides of the door waiting for the other to
          do something ray is mortified about having asked the last question

          

          

           harry

          harry plays music a cd with songs that diego has selected for him

           44

          bonsai delicately with the tip of his fingers
          the phone rings

          the next morning harry wears different clothes than in the previous
          sequence and ray x as well

          

          
          the doorbell rings its ray x mariacruz opens the door harry
          waits for him while seated at his desk one can hear the noises his
          computer generates
          ray x heads toward the den and introduces himself
          harry stretches his hand and waits for the other man to find it and
          shake it

          

          

           ray x
           hi im ray x

          

          
          they shake hands

          

          

           harry
           hello mr x please have a seat

           ray x
           please dont address me formally

          

          
          perhaps the kitchen is lit and only the light from the window enters
          the area where the conversation is taking place
          ray watches harry inquisitively he observes everything the
          furniture the wallhangings and harrys own body shamelessly taking
          advantage of the fact that harry cannot see him
          mateo senses the heat of his visitors gaze over his body

          

          

           46

          
          ray is thirtyfive years old and his physique is somewhere between
          freakish and bohemian but expensively dressed hard to classify thin
          with a beard only when he speaks he reveals his wellbred origin
          not excessively nor parodically just sufficiently evocative he
          is excited by the very fact of being there it seems it is something
          he has been desiring for some time
          he takes advantage of the fact that harry cannot see him in order to
          observe him without reserve
          during the conversation harry is not always sitting at some point
          he moves to look for cigarettes perhaps and remains standing

          

          

           ray
           i love your work i know it from the start

           harry
           thank you

           ray
           i have seen all of mateo blancos films including the
           last one girls and suitcases

           harry
           is that so you must be the only one

          

          

          

          

          40 harrys home vestibule and kitchen int day 2008


          

          
          at this exact moment diego enters mariacruz opens the door for him
          just in time to hear rays question

          

          

           ray
           what happened to mateo blanco

           harry

          

          

           47

          
           why do you ask

          

          

          

          

          40 a

          

          
          diego goes to the kitchen harry has heard him he knows hes there
          if he hasnt called him its because he doesnt need him

          

          

           ray
           because he vanished from public life

           harry
           it would seem that way

           ray
           almost as if hed died

           harry
           yes    ironically i lost track of him some time ago

           ray
           ive always been intrigued by the case of his last film

           harry
           whose

           ray
           mateo blancos the first five are stupendous you
           were the screenwriter for all of them how do you
           explain that the last one was a disaster

           harry
           made uncomfortable by the topic films turn out well
           or badly the reason is always a mystery mateo
           switched genres perhaps he wasnt skilled for
           comedy but tell me about the story you want to
           write

          

          

          

          

           48

          
          ray x measures his words its very important to him and he doesnt
          want to do so hastily

          

          

           ray
            i would like to write a story about a sons revenge
           one against the memory of his father

           harry
           why does the son desire revenge

           ray
           speaking personally because the father ruined his
           life practically nullifying him while he lived the
           father is a successful financier violent homophobic
           very powerful and unscrupulous he thinks everyone
           has a price and thats how he behaves with people i
           dont know if youve had the misfortune of meeting
           someone like this

          

          
          harry does not allay his doubt

          

          

           harry
           when you say he is powerful what kind of power are
           you referring to

           ray x
           economic with everything that entails he is a
           broker of the generation of speculators that made
           quick highprofit gains in the 80s he amassed a
           great fortune during the oil crisis the son is
           sensitive with complexes and artistic preoccupations
           and lives under his shadow trying to please the
           father in everything despite being a bit
           homosexual the son marries twice just like the
           father and just like him he separates he has a

           49

          
           son that hates him just as much as he hates his own
           father when the father dies the son is finally able
           to rebuild his life that is his salvation and his
           revenge

          

          

           harry
           i get it i am afraid i am not the writer you are
           looking for

           ray x
           you are you dont know how much!

          

          
          harry registers what he has just heard

          

          

           ray x
           i will pay whatever you ask

           harry
           its too personal

           ray x
           make it yours i am not aiming for a biopic rather
           i think of it as a base from which to develop a
           fiction

           harry
           thanks but no he rises and now if you dont mind

          

          

          

          

          41 continued

          

          
          he calls diego the boy responds in that instant he was in the
          kitchen waiting for harry to call him
          ray x will not give up so he writes his telephone number on a piece
          of paper and places it in his hand

          

          

           50

          

           ray x
           there you have my phone number if you change your mind

          

          
          harry is still standing with the piece of paper in his hand diego
          observes both men
          ray gets up

          

          

           ray x
           i am sure we will see each other again

           harry
           in my case that would be a miracle

          

          
          diego accompanies him to the door and closes it behind him
          harry opens his desks drawer and places the piece of paper with rays
          telephone number inside he rummages through the drawers interior
          until he finds a key he grabs it

          

          

          

          

          42 continued

          

          
          harry and diego are now alone in the den ruminating over ray xs
          visit and the story he was proposing harry

          

          

           harry
           did you overhear that

           diego
           yes im flipping out! why did he ask you if mateo
           had died

           harry

          

          

          

          

           51

          
           to provoke me i dont know help me find
           something he points toward the drawers at the
           bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to
           open one of them look inside that drawer

          

          
          diego opens the drawer with the key harry has given him the drawer
          is full of different groups of photographs and various objects mixed
          in a certain order there is a black notebook a box with mexican
          handicrafts some 1980s postcards as well some from other decades
          some movie postcards some others of exotic landscapes some of the
          groups of photographs are sorted into envelopes boxes or transparent
          binders for diego its like looking into a treasure chest it has
          been many years since that drawer has been opened this was out of
          respect not from lack of curiosity diego would never do so behind
          harrys back

          

          

           harry
           look through the pictures of the 94 shoot some of
           the photographs must have the date on it

          

          
          after tossing aside various envelopes diego finds a lot of
          photographs of the shooting dated 94 he takes them out of their
          envelope
          he shuffles through them until he pauses at one

          

          

           diego

          harry is perturbed by the confirmation of his doubts he would have
          preferred to be mistaken

          

          

           harry
           serious and pensive you can put them away now

          

          
          diego returns the different sets of photographs to their place inside
          the drawer a photo appears of lenas face in closeup its the same
          woman who appears in sequences 20 through 36

           53

          
          the drawer closes darkness engulfs its interior drowning lenas
          image soon reborn in the next sequence

          

          

          

          

          43 home ernesto martel senior 1992

          

          
          out of the darkness lenas image emerges the year is 92 a close
          up of the woman looking at herself in the mirror touching up her
          makeup she grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts
          it on

          

          
          a few meters away in the bedroom ernesto buttons up his fly after
          tucking in his shirt tail the scene is that of a wealthy couple who
          get along
          they are preparing to attend a concert ernesto is a big fan of
          classical music

          

          
          lena looks rejuvenated and more refined her life and her facial skin
          have both improved since the first time we see her in martels office
          the moles have disappeared from her face her demeanor is still adult
          that of a young woman who has experienced life

          

          
          ernesto martel frequently rests his gaze on her fascinated its hard
          for him to believe that such beauty belongs to him

          

          

          

          

          44 continued

          

          
          the phone rings ernesto senior picks up the handset his relaxed
          countenance changes the second he hears the voice on the other end

          while he speaks lena consults him about the jewelry she is about to
          put on she tries on different pairs of earrings for his approval
          something he gives without pausing his phone conversation

           55

          
          lena makes a gesture of reproach ernesto should not speak to his ex
          wife in that tone

          

          

           off

          he sips from his drink or he serves himself another one if he has
          already finished the first

          

          

           ernesto

           lena

          

          
           ernesto takes a sip from his drink

          ernesto senior casts her a sideways glance

           why so

           diego
           in huge letters it says donate blood it includes
           where one has to go

           harry
           you want to donate blood

           diego
           no no i was thinking that donate blood is a good
           title for a movie

           harry
           yes it has a good ring

           diego
           for a vampire flick

          

          
          harry finds it amusing they walk toward home

          

          

           harry
           its true

           diego
           ironizing kidding improvising imagine that behind
           the billboard a whole group of vampires that work in
           ambulatory care are hiding and they actually keep the
           blood they get from donors for their own consumption
           of course

           harry
           your mother would like that story

          

          
          cut to

          51 harrys home int day 2008


          

          
          mariacruz the latin american maid is preparing something in the
          kitchen meanwhile diego and mateo gather around the table diego
          sits in front of his laptop

          

          
          both of the characters are improvising rapidly and become
          increasingly excited completing each others sentences they are
          having fun as if playing a game the sequence becomes a
          demonstration of the process of creating fiction based on an trivial
          real anecdote they will begin the sequence by opening a document
          diego writes the title in caps donate blood

          

          

           diego
           the vampires would be like a type of ethnic group
           completely assimilated into spanish society they
           dont stand out there are vampires who occupy
           important positions keeping it a secret like the
           opus dei but even though they live in the shadows
           they have amassed great social and economic power

           harry
           they control various industries for example the one
           responsible for dark sunglasses

           diego
           smiles and those that provide nightly entertainment
           bars discos afterhours since they dont need drugs
           to stay awake they are the most apt for working at
           night they dont burn out

           harry

          

          

           65

          
           and for the sunscreen business the poor things are
           very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in
           the ozone layer their sunscreens are some of the
           best on the market

           diego
           laughs and those which sell best this is all great

          

          
          diego talks and takes notes on his laptop harry paces back and
          forth in front of the table like a caged animal

          

          

           harry
           protected by the sunscreen they can function all day
           the lotion must be as dense as armour

           diego
           more inspired this is how the story could begin
           describes a gorgeous woman totally naked rubbing
           her body with a superdense lotion before heading to
           work at an ambulatory hospital her body is a velvety
           pale beautiful

           harry
           continues what a great opening! we also need a love
           story

           diego
           a hybrid love story between the female vampire and a
           normal guy

           harry
           like in cat people a love story between beings of
           different species

           diego
           she works at one of those labs where blood is donated
           and where they snatch it for themselves the guy has
           gone to donate his or to get some tests they like

           66

          
          each other immediately after the first needle prick
          into his vein she gets completely excited so they
          start to date but she doesnt want to turn him into
          a vampire these arent proselytizing vampires they
          are above biting people unless they truly need it to
          survive

           harry
          but they must like sex right

           diego
          of course thats one of the problems the couple
          desire each other desperately but when it comes to
          fucking she becomes prudish

           harry
          why

           diego
          because she is afraid of losing control in her
          excitement and taking a bite into his jugular

           harry
          aha

           diego
          when theyre horny she lets him do everything front
          back whatever he wants except ravaging her mouth

           harry
          and her breasts

           diego
          also but that gets into highrisk territory when
          he sucks on her breasts she has to cover her mouth
          with a pillow which she ends up shredding with her
          fangs

           harry
          and when she sucks his dick

           diego

           67

          
           no no sucking she would tear it on the first bite

           harry
           and how does he react a man may do without kissing
           but its very rough not to have your cock sucked

           diego
           since he is deeply in love he accepts the situation
           or gives up to it once they are more comfortable
           with each other she wears a muzzle as security for
           both because when shes turned on she has a type of
           dental erection her face grows into something like
           that of a shewolf

          

          
          diego writes furiously while cracking up

          

          

           harry
           i like your story very much diego

           diego

           harry
           no this one was your idea and youll author it
           ill be your sparring partner for all the times
           youve done the same for me

          

          
          harry is welcoming him as a writer this fact doesnt escape the boy
          he feels an unexpected pride

           harry
           my god! but diego is a very healthy boy

          

          
          the doctor makes a neutral gesture of acknowledgement

          

          

          

          

           72

          

           doctor

           doctor

           working outside madrid i would prefer to call her
           myself i dont want to alarm her unless he is truly
           in a grave condition

           doctor
           normally he should recuperate in a few hours but
           in any case you should have a talk with him once
           hes better

           harry
           yes of course

          

          

          

          

           73

          
          they arrive at a couch set ugly and lacking style harry collapses on
          one of the armchairs demolished
          the doctor returns to work
          the girl at the reception desk stares at harry who is immobile
          readied for a long wait
          a slow fade to black

          from black
          harry is still waiting this time at home sitting on a wingback chair
          close to the bed where diego sleeps
          on the nightstand there are some medications and a glass of water
          next to a plastic bottle an alarmclock and perhaps a book
          through the window you can see the day beginning to break diego
          awakens at first he doesnt know where he is in the darkness of
          the room he discovers harrys figure sitting on the wingback chair
          he cant tell if hes awake or asleep but it soothes him to know hes
          not alone diego stares at him he doesnt say anything just
          stares
          to his surprise harry asks him

          

          

           harry
           how are you

          

          
          diego makes a listless gesture

          

          

           diego
           i dont know dazed did you speak with my mother

           harry

          

          

           74

          
           yes i told her it was something you ate

           diego
           and she believed it

           harry
           i dont know she wanted to hurry back but i
           convinced her to continue with the location scouting
           at some point youll have to call her

          

          
          silence diego thinks about everythings thats happened
          after a few seconds

          

          

           harry
           are you asleep

           diego
           im not sleepy anymore

           harry
           do you want to talk

           diego
           no

           harry
           would you like me to speak

           diego
           i dont know if youd like

           harry
           i say so in order to distract you when i was young
           before i got into making movies i was very good at
           telling stories

           diego
           not sure well then would you mind telling me why
           my mother is so afraid of ernesto junior

           harry
           shes afraid of him

           75

          

           diego
           before she left she made me promise that i would
           remain alert in case he reappeared

           harry
           she didnt explain why

           diego
           she never explains anything

          

          
          harry remains pensive for a moment diegos request has taken him by
          surprise

          

          

           harry
           its a long story

           diego
           judit says the same thing how did you meet him

          

          
          it is not easy to talk about in some way it must be obvious that
          harry has spent many years fourteen avoiding this topic but he is
          determined to do anything necessary to entertain diego
          diego serves himself some water and prepares to listen

          

          

           harry
           we met him in an office we had rented in preparation
           for my new film about fourteen years ago

          filled with papers photographs books magazines an ashtray pencil
          and pen holders etc at its center a script lies open with tons of
          notes scribbled on the margins of its pages he is finishing the
          definitive version of girls and suitcases

          

          
          the casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic the
          only decorations on the walls here and there not following any
          particular symmetrical rule are postcards of painters actors or
          landscapes held in place by tacks there is also a newspaper page
          that has caught mateos attention or some astonishing photograph
          taken from a magazine the cover of some magazine everything without
          framing tacked directly onto the wall
          the furniture is pastel mediumshade green or red with velvet
          tapestry worn and outmoded the pieces dont match but they look
          good together

          

          
          judit enters also fourteen years younger but this is less obvious
          she is a woman unmarked by the march of time
          mateo is focused on the scripts pages judit is mateos righthand
          man they are accomplices in everything both professionally and
          emotionally

          

          

           judit

           77

          
           a girl has stopped by she doesnt have an appointment
           so there is no reason for you to see her

           mateo
           without much interest whats she like

           judit
           too beautiful to be funny

           mateo
           smiles really

           judit
           she is ernesto martels lover the tycoon she is
           here with his son

           mateo
           and shes an actress

           judit
           ironic her if shes been with him for three years
           she must be in any case go out and say hello to be
           polite one must get along well with important men
           you never know

          

          

          

          

          57 continued waiting area 1994

          

          
          mateo exits his office in the improvised waiting area it is not a
          proper waiting room but a transientspace turned waiting area by a
          couch left over from the furnishings of some previous film he finds
          ernesto junior in other words the character who had introduced
          himself as ray x fourteen years ago in his case the agedifference
          is noticeable hes just a kid he is a little heavier his hair
          longer he reminds us of the lovestruck bigkid that phyllip seymour
          hoffman played in boogie nights

          

          

          

          

           78

          
          mateos gaze rests only for an instant on the young man even though
          the boy does not take his stupefied eyes away from mateo throughout
          the entire sequence

          

          
          ernesto junior has accompanied lena when he sees her mateo freezes
          at the door to his office
          lenas back is turned or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine
          ernesto elbows her lena raises her head and discovers mateo watching
          her from the door to his office
          mateos heart churns its a cinematographic churn he feels like
          james stewart in vertigo when he first sees kim novak at the
          restaurant with her famous green dress time stops for an instant so
          that mateo may contemplate this womans apparition

          

          
          after this brief hypnotic moment they introduce themselves
          forgetting ernestos presence who then since no one pays attention
          to him introduces himself
          even though shes a bit nervous one can tell that lena is a strong
          and decisive woman brunette mysterious madeup in dark tones that
          stand out on her pale skin refined she doesnt have the aspect of a
          comedienne her presence is too intense she seems better suited to be
          the heroine of a film noir as weve said
          genres and their iconographies pose no limit on mateos capacity to be
          attracted to her from the first instant

          

          

           lena
           i am sorry we showed up like this but ive heard you
           are running auditions and i would like for you to
           give me a try out

          

          
          mateo observes her intently she does not resemble any of the
          characters in the script but he no longer cares about that at some

           79

          
          point judit makes her appearance and gets to contemplate this scene
          herself displeased

          

          

           lena
           i can come whatever day is convenient

          

          

          

          

           mateo
           youre already here lets read something

          

          
          it doesnt sound like lets read something but more like lets have
          a drink
          they disappear through mateos office door
          fade to black

           the reading didnt work out we were both too nervous
           the first meeting and the reading we did only served
           to make me realize that womans very presence
           perturbed me

          ernesto grabs her and then embraces her lena remains still within his
          arms imprisoned and elusive the two locked in a strange posture

          

          

           lena

          of the hired help behind the door its mr mateo blanco and he
          says its important

          

          

           lena
           yells come in!

          

          
          she breaks free from ernestos embrace and runs toward the door where
          the maid is holding the supplementary handset avidly she grabs it
          from her she listens excited she responds only in monosyllables
          affirmatively she hangs up the phone her eyes glitter with intense
          happiness a feeling from which ernesto feels excluded

          

          

           lena
           enthusiastically thats the film director he says
           the reading was not sufficient and he wants to see me
           once more!

          

          
          lena looks imploringly at ernesto senior

          

          

           83

          

           ernesto s

          diego is better but harry prefers to keep caring for him harry
          makes him breakfast diego is sitting at the table

          

          

           harry
           ernesto martel offered to produce the movie your
           mother didnt want him to she was waiting for a
           subsidy from the ministry and an advance sale to
           television but that would take months and i was
           suddenly in a great hurry to begin shooting

          

          

          

          

          62 dressing room for makeup hair and costume int day


          1994

          

          
          part of the voiceoff is edited over these images
          lena is in the process of being madeup coifed and dressed this
          under the control of mateo blanco who does not stop speaking
          offering references making ironic remarks etc all of this is seen
          through the lens of a 16mm camera images of contrasting colors
          the editing is vertiginous and doesnt at all respect continuity

          

          

           85

          
          rules the young ernesto junior is carrying the camera we also see
          this scene from the other side of the 16mm frame from the point of
          view of the main narration which includes images of ernesto junior
          filming with the 16mm camera

          

          
          on the inside frame of the dressing room mirror there are photographs
          of a young shirley maclaine kate hepburn young judy holliday
          audrey hepburn goldie hawn in butterflies are free or any other
          film where she wears her hair long with a fringe icons of the
          romantic comedy of today and yesteryear
          over the voices of the characters that appear on frame one hears
          harrys voiceoff

          

          

           off harry
           i enjoyed making her up styling her and dressing
           her lena could be the shirley mclaine of the
           apartment and the audrey hepburn of breakfast at
           tiffanys or even goldie hawn

          

          
          through the 16mm camera we can see the details of lenas mutating
          image how it gets constructed it is true that she reminds us of the
          three actresses that harry mentions in his voiceoff the members of
          the team assisting her hairstylist makeup artist costume designer
          etc and lena herself laugh heartily when they finish setting her up
          with goldies blonde longhair wig with a fringe and they stare
          dumbfounded when she is madeup as audrey hepburn in breakfast at
          tiffanys or sabrina its a style that fits lena like a glove
          they are all fascinated by the change except judit estranged and
          angered by their playfulness
          for judit mateo is constructing his ideal woman she finds all that
          playing around obscene and dangerous

          

          

           86

          

           off harry
           your mother didnt like lena

          

          
          judit watches lenaaudrey with a fatalistic stare

          

          

           off harry
           i on the other hand liked her a lot and she liked
           me

          

          
          mateo manifests his enthusiasm over the changes and lena looks at him
          with excitement she also feels transformed on the inside and thats
          thanks to mateo

          

          

           off harry
           ernesto junior also liked me

          

          
          ernesto junior directs his camera lens toward harrys face not hiding
          his admiration

          

          

           off harry
           i was hoping to use him for my own ends his father
           had asked him to make a documentary about the
           shooting

          night 1994

          

          
          ernesto senior is watching the makeup test the hairstyling test
          etc part of what we have already seen through the 16mm lens the
          sound is chaotic many people are always speaking at once

          

          

           87

          

           continued off harry
           as far as ernesto senior was concerned we observe
           him watching the projection uncomfortably ive never
           known a man more obsessed with a woman except myself
           he was producing the film out of a desperate attempt
           to not lose lena in the middle of this emotional
           quagmire we began shooting your mother was present
           at every instant her face like a sergeants

          

          
          end with a shot in 16mm of judit

          to be determined 1994

          

          
          images from the making of shot by ernesto junior on 16mm with high
          grain and contrast mixed with direct images from the establishing
          shot of what is occurring
          the look of lenas character is openly inspired by the audrey hepburn
          of breakfast at tiffanys with sabrinas hair style and loop
          earrings fringe and ponytail she has also adopted the style of
          holy golithly her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that
          characterizes modern girls from rural origins the only difference is
          a more visceral quality pina lenas character is exalted and
          mediterranean nothing like hepburn her wardrobe is that of a modern
          girl in 94 she is a professional model for cosmetic products one
          of her advertising photographs is framed and hangs on one of the walls
          of the loft where she lives

          

          

          

          

           88

          

          in studiomade kitchen inside the complex pinas loft

          

          
          pina lenas character is cutting tomatoes for a gazpacho inside a
          beautiful and shiny kitchen
          pina is sad probably thinking about all the times she has had
          gazpacho with ivan the absent lover a tear drops from her face onto
          the knife with which shes cutting the tomatoes in slow motion one
          sees the collision of the tear with the knife in a cutin hers is a
          subtly comic sadness

          

          
          when she is done grinding up the tomatoes she takes a box of

          all the pills into the gazpacho she keeps two or three for herself

          background without being able to hear what they are saying mateo
          speaking to lena they are both holding a script in their hands
          mateo is giving her directions everything is very professional but
          their demeanor radiates understanding complicity and a latent
          desire they are not talking about anything personal

          

          
          now we will do the part where you return home frustrated after
          having left ivan a note on his door when you bump into julieta
          you just open this door you look at the answering machine from afar
          the machine has become some kind of monster to you you are terrified
          of it
          a monster
          yes your sanity depends on it if the light blinks it means there
          may have been a call and if it doesnt blink you cant do anything
          but wait and you lost your patience some time ago

          rapport between them he does so strategically given that he thinks

          desire contained by both during the past weeks explodes and levels
          them neither one does anything to stop it a train passes by at

          ernesto senior awaits for her in the living room in front of a muted
          television with a drink in hand perhaps the train will still be
          present on the television screen
          lena approaches him and kisses him

           lena
           because you must put on makeup and then remove it
           dress up do your hair get dressed again do your
           hair again and that takes hours

           one makes movies

           judit
           ernesto is a businessman not an artist

           mateo
           then he shouldnt have signed up as a producer no one
           asked him

           judit
           i warned you! ernesto martel doesnt give a crap
           about this movie and those of us making it except for
           one person! this weekend he is taking her to ibiza

          lena and ernesto spend the weekend together at an ibizan house
          minutely decorated with ethnic details the decoration super
          luxurious hippie does not ring untrue to the islands aesthetic
          consider that ernesto senior and lena are in the bedroom on the bed
          making love luxuriously theres no hurry they pay careful attention
          to all the details
          after the final sprint they both come satisfied or so it seems
          ernesto remains spent on the bed motionless lena gets up and goes
          to the bathroom
          she opens the faucet and lets the water run
          immediately she is overtaken by vicious retching on her knees she
          vomits into the toilet
          after shes done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the
          mirror she wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet she looks
          very pale the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face
          quickly she puts some makeup on enough to bring some color back to
          her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes her eyes still
          glimmer from the tears shes shed more than in any other sequence
          it is here that lena reveals her talent as an actress
          she exits the bathroom wrapped in an elegant robe a bit divine
          hippie

          chus the porter who is holding two metal objects a robert indiana
          love impressive and metallic and a gucci alarm clock in the shape
          of a g the g is also metallic
          chus stops her almost by force she is a very communicative woman
          and pina attempts to get her off her back as quickly as possible
          without being rude to her
          chus shows her both objects with a questioning look on her face

           its not alright ms pina

          

          
          the scene is very simple but it must exude charm chus is a natural
          comic talent and pinas character must act with a flippancy that plays
          comically at the same time lena is noticeably exhausted both
          physically and emotionally instead of lending the text lightness she
          brings it down and shes aware of it

           101

          
          for the first time mateo does not hide his annoyance as a director
          because the scene turns out badly and as a lover because he is
          jealous of her weekend with ernesto senior lena cannot stand to look
          at him she cant bare his angered expression
          mateo takes her aside to a secluded corner of the set and away from
          the team

          

          

           mateo
           serious your tone is off magdalena

           lena
           very depressed i know

           mateo
           in a very low voice whats wrong

           lena
           whispers on the brink of tears ill tell you later

          

          
          mateo gestures for the assistant to come over lena still has her
          back toward the team mateo says something to the assistant who then
          says out loud for all to hear

          

          

           assistant
           we break for thirty minutes its snack time!

          

          
          mateo meets with lena in the darkest corner of the entrance hall

          ernesto senior must be intercut watching in his screening room all
          that occurs at the shoot next to him the lipreader

          76 continued entrance hall

          

          
          the members of the team slowly depart from the entrance hall they
          take the opportunity to grab a bite or get some air they gather close
          to the trucks or next to the catering all except ernesto junior who
          remains inside and hides furtively behind a styrofoam panel somewhat
          removed from the couple who cannot see him
          mateo looks all around to ensure that they are alone

          

          

           mateo
           with urgency whats happened

           lena
           ive had a horrible weekend

           mateo

           rest i havent slept a wink all weekend sighs on
           the brink of tears its been a nightmare!

          

          
          mateo once again ascertains that there is no one in the entrance hall
          he hands her a kleenex so that she may wipe her tears

          

          

           lena
           i have literally had ernesto on top of me all those
           fortyeight hours like a leech! repulsed
           expression he has not given me a second to breathe

           103

          
          mateo grabs her by the arm and takes her up the stairs to an apartment
          that the production company has rented in the same building

          ernesto senior hears the entire conversation from the lips of the lip
          reader a stony expression on his face the reader repeats the
          dialogues in an unexpressive tone which makes them sound even more
          dramatic and painful
          cut to
          fade to black

          returning from black
          various shots of pinas loft everything seems chaotic typical of
          the end of the work day the furniture is out of place silverware
          and plastic is all mixed together with electrical material and stage
          equipment the warehouse lights begin to shut off
          the team disbands

          

          
          on her way to the dressing room lena tells ernesto junior that she is
          headed to her yoga class as she does every day and that she wants
          to go alone

          

          

           ernesto junior

          

          

          

          

           104

          
           my father asks me why it is that i dont go with you
           to yoga he asks me all the time

           lena
           well you tell him that i am a grownup now and free
           and that ive forbidden you to follow me

           ernesto junior

          and she leaves him behind ernesto junior watches her walk away
          disoriented he always has a tripod attached to his camera as in
          peeping tom

          its the fist time we see this setting the entrance of the building
          where mateo lives almost all the windows are darkened its
          midnight we watch this sequence through the 16mm camera situated
          just in front of the buildings doorway
          we watch as mateo appears on the sidewalk walking toward the
          buildings doorway
          in front of the building in the main narrative we see ernesto junior
          filming with his 16mm camera he is hiding behind a bush or cloaked
          by a trees shade either way mateo does not discover him

          lower level
          at the same time that the former is taking place lena arrives to
          martels mansion she finds ernesto senior with a drink in his hand
          in one of the living areas or playing the piano she approaches him
          and gives him a slight kiss on the lips in a gesture of hello

          

          

           ernesto senior
           quotidian and tranquil an unexpected demeanor for a
           character of his temperament how are you

           lena
           good tired

           ernesto senior
           and relaxed

           lena
           on guard yes

           ernesto senior
           the yoga is doing you good isnt it

          

          
          lena catches ernestos allusion but she pretends she hasnt she
          demonstrates her control over herself and her cold determination

          

          

           lena
           yes especially after work

           ernesto senior
           i am going to snack on something will you join me

           lena
           i am not hungry id rather go to bed right now ill
           only have a yogurt

          

          

           106

          
          lena climbs up the long staircase heads directly for her room
          ernesto listens to her steps as they recede his ironic tranquility
          disappears and gives way to a furious expression
          fade to black

          from black a different day

          

          
          framed by the window to mateos living room seen from the street one
          observes the bottom halves of mateos and lenas bodies as they move
          around the apartment only half of their body is visible because the
          roman shades are halfway drawn one gets the impression that mateo
          is showing her around the house
          they say goodbye
          we see all this through a 16mm camera without a pause in the
          shooting we realize that the person carrying the camera crosses the
          street and waits outside of the front door to mateos building

          

          

          

          

          82 front door to mateos building night ext 1994


          

          
          lena exits through the door the second she discovers the camera she
          confronts it

          

          

           lena
           ernesto what are you doing here

           ernesto junior
           working

          

          

           107

          

           lena
           turn that off you idiot! hasnt mateo forbidden you
           to tape us outside the shooting

          

          
          not far from them there is a garbage truck that is making horrendous
          noises and makes it difficult to hear what they are saying the truck
          gets closer and the noises louder so that ernesto junior and lena must
          scream back and forth at each other

          

          

           ernesto junior
           my father has told me not to listen to him he wants
           to see everything

           lena
           you both have no scruples!

           ernesto junior
           remember i am taping you

          

          
          lena throws herself at ernesto junior and attempts to take the camera
          from him they struggle the camera continues shooting the images
          move around dizzyingly ernesto junior manages to break free from
          lena they are both out of breath ernesto backs up a few steps in
          order to frame lena again and so that he can focus her image lena
          could take off running but instead she stays right where she is she
          lets ernesto bring her into focus and frame her correctly while she
          fixes her hair she looks straight at the camera

          

          

           lena
           in a barrage listen carefully ernesto yes i am
           talking to you she points toward mateos house i
           was just with the man i love and i am the happiest
           ive been all my life because he loves me too!
           screams and listen carefully ernesto! i will let

           108

          
           you be very soon! there is no need to spy on me
           there is nothing left to hide!

          

          

          

          

          83 private screening room ernesto seniors mansion int day


          1994

          

          
          we see this at the same moment its happening
          the next day ernesto senior is watching the previous nights scene on
          the screen of his private projection room we discover this when he
          is halfway into it the images pick the action up at the point when
          lena exits mateos house and confronts the camera right after she has
          attempted to grab the camera away from ernesto junior
          the shots in 16mm alternate with the shots in 35mm that belong to the
          main narrative the sound is uproarious we can hear what they say in
          a low volume just as reference ernesto asks for the sound to be
          muted so that the translator can do her job
          the lip reader tries as usual to be neutral and inexpressive
          but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the
          scene affect her she acts as a mere vehicle not part of the
          conflict nonetheless she gets a little nervous she is seated next
          to the volcano ernesto senior stony frozen silent and about to
          explode

          

          

          

          

          84 continued same location

          

          
          just a little earlier right before the dizzying images appear on
          screen those caused by lenas attempt to remove the camera from
          ernesto juniors hands

          

          

          

          

           109

          
          on the opposite end of where the screen is behind the back of both
          ernesto and the translator a door opens lena appears
          she watches the scene that is unfolding on screen as she lets her
          voice rise to her mouth the entire dialogue in which she has
          addressed ernesto senior directly is seen during the action taking
          place in the projection room not on the street at first her voice
          overlaps with that of the translator who becomes instantly silent and
          turns her head toward the door where lena is standing lena is
          dubbing herself

          

          

           lena
           i was just with the man i love and i am the happiest
           that ive been all my life because he loves me too!
           and listen carefully ernesto! i will let you be very
           soon! there is no need to spy on me i dont have
           anything left to hide!

          

          
          the translator watches lena and ernesto senior who is still
          motionless watching the screen
          on screen we see lena walking her back turned for a good stretch
          with an equal obsession she is followed down the street by the son
          and in the screening room by the father

          

          

          

          

          85 lenas bedroom ernestos mansion dusk falling 1994

          

          
          an avalanche of snow on the television screen
          some short shots of both ice and whisky as they fall into a tall
          glass function as an ellipsis between one scene and the next

          

          

          

          

           110

          
          lena paces around anxiously in her bedroom she attempts to focus on
          a fashion magazine but is unsuccessful she takes a deep breath
          makes a decision she opens the closet and takes out a small weekend
          suitcase she fills it with her most indispensable clothes

          

          
          she exits her bedroom on the top floor in the hallway only a few
          meters separate the door to her bedroom from the stairway there is a
          small landing just before the top of the stairs it has a small table
          against the wall a beautiful vase with flowers a mirror and two
          small sofas on either side of the small table ernesto is seated on
          one of them holding a glass of whisky in his right hand it cannot
          be the first hes had one could say hes been waiting some time now
          for lenas exit a bottle and an icebox keeping him company lena
          walks a few steps se approaches ernesto but keeps her distance
          she speaks to him in passing

          

          

           lena
           suitcase in hand i am leaving ernesto i am leaving
           you

           ernesto senior
           cold drunk contemptuous you are not going anywhere

           lena
           and how will you stop me

          

          
          every single one of the words in this dialogue sounds laded and slow
          no sooner has she said it than lena realizes that it has been an
          unnecessary provocation but its too late to take back whats been
          said ernesto senior shoots her a deathly look but then gets up and
          changes his expression to calm her

          

          

           ernesto s
           pleading lena please

           111

          
          one more time ernesto begs forgiveness but lena doesnt want to see
          him or hear him she turns and begins to descend the stairs the
          first step

          

          
          ernesto approaches her slowly from behind he is still pleading as
          in a litany lena please lena

          

          

          86 continued on the stairway

          

          
          but lena keeps her back to his supplication descends one more step
          her second one suddenly without any change in his expression
          ernesto pushes her with a quick and unexpected movement of his arm
          lena loses her balance and falls rolling bouncing violently against
          the edges of the steps until her whole body hits the floor at the foot
          of the stairs during the time the fall takes ernesto doesnt move
          he watches her fall bump by bump he waits until shes on the floor
          and she casts him a fulminating glance before he reacts

          

          

          

          

          87 continued

          

          
          lena lands on the floor broken and stunned by the blows
          she lifts her head and attempts to move but cant ernesto descends
          quickly and comes to her side he begs calmly without violence for
          her not to move lena cannot stand her battered body only allows her
          to drag herself toward the door like a reptile
          ernesto takes her delicately in his arms lena gazes at him in
          horror

          arms they look like two newlyweds the dogs disconcerted follow
          them in procession they intuit that something is not right

          

          
          once inside the car none of the hired help is there that night he
          opens the gate from the inside and exits onto the highway

          complaining ernesto is driving faster than 180 km/hr he alerts a
          pair of patrolmen when he realizes hes being followed he increases
          his speed the patrolmen signal with their lights for him to stop on

          the two patrolmen get out of their vehicle and head enraged toward
          ernesto they gesture for him to lower his window
          ernesto lowers the window relaxed despite the situation the two
          patrolmen especially the one who calls the shots recriminate him
          their voices raised for all the infractions he has just committed
          they are very agitated and they quickly notice the high level of
          alcohol emitted by the drivers breath
          knocked out on the back seat lena observes the whole scene her face
          is contorted with pain and anxiety

          a river of cars continues to pass nearby
          using a nasty tone one of the policemen asks ernesto for his
          documents
          the following conversation takes place while the policemen verify the
          vehicles documents ernesto explains to them with a common sense

          in order to ascertain that she is indeed not faking it

          the last thing we see is the xray of the head which dissolves over
          lenas head and face as she asks a nurse for the telephone telling
          her that she needs to make an urgent phone call
          ernesto censures her with his look once the last xray has been
          taken the nurse brings her a supplementary handset and plugs it in
          she hands the handset to lena

          ernesto looks at her not knowing what to expect nonetheless he
          remains seated next to her lena doesnt react she doesnt care if
          he overhears the conversation she almost wants him to
          the brutal beating to which she has been victim is an inescapable
          reality that gives her an edge over ernesto an edge of which she
          intends to take advantage she is wounded but she is no longer
          afraid of him

          which both frames and silhouettes the figures of ernesto and lena
          like cutouts creating a powerful image epic and terrible
          they bump into some of the members of the team who begin their work

          mateo is seated at a casual table the entire decoration of the
          office is casual and chaotic not luxurious austere nothing like
          lenas dressing room an enormous drip eats away at one of the
          corners of the room
          lena is sitting across from him on a wheelchair and seated on an
          ugly armchair ernesto senior judit is also present shes standing
          they have just finished talking lena has told the version that she
          and ernesto senior agreed on

          mateo looks at them in disbelief judit still as a statue waits for
          the others reactions lena breathes expectantly and ernesto
          senior looks uncomfortable and insecure he is used to being the one
          who calls the shots the inverse role that of listener disorients
          him and puts him in a bad mood

          

          

           lena
           ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide

           mateo
           containing his rage decide what! i cant move
           from one shot where you are walking normally to
           another one where you are wearing a cast! how long
           must you wear the cast

           moment

          

          
          its not a question but a demand
          judit shoots him a look of recrimination as if saying this is not
          the moment for that but she cannot do anything to stop him
          ernesto senior is also not pleased but he knows he cannot say no and
          this irritates him even more he glances first at lena who orders
          him with her own glance to accept and then looks at judit who warmly
          invites him to exit with her
          for some reason ernesto senior empathizes with that woman

          at each other as if seeking some kind of understanding despite their
          differences and they find it they are joined by their jealousy
          at the other end of the warehouse like a mirage amongst the shadows
          pinas loft appears majestic ramshackle and mysterious ernesto
          contemplates it without understanding it but is affected by its
          presence he is unable to understand the essence of this makebelief
          game but its the first time he begins to grasp its hermetic
          fascination

           not to pause!

          

          
          mateo goes over the story in his head desperately attempting to think
          of something lena observes him expectantly finally something
          seems to hit him

          

          

           mateo
           unenthusiastic we would have to repeat part of the
           stairway scene

          

          

          

          

          101 shooting at the stairway stairway landing ivans house

          int day 1994


          

          
          taking up the whole screen we see the scene through the moviola
          with the texture of a bad copy streaks grain etc the solution
          mateo has proposed is to repeat the last part of the sequence on the
          surface of the moviola screen the reflection of mateos face is
          barely visible over the first set of images screened

          

          
          a wooden landing and stairway in a building of the old madrid at its
          center an elevator also antique

          

          
          pina has just left a note for ivan on the door to his study asking him
          to please call on her that she needs to speak to him urgently that
          something unexpected has come up she is dressed as she was when she
          came out of the entrance hall in the previous scene with chus this
          sequence is supposed to be the one that follows it

          

          

          

          

           126

          
          she has just left the note when julieta appears she is dressed
          conventionally but with some extravagant detail something that
          garners attention she bumps into pina by the elevator pina does not
          know her julieta knocks on the studios door just as pina had done
          earlier she doesnt get an answer she notices the note that pina
          has just affixed on the door she takes it down and reads it much to
          pinas bafflement who has been watching her from the other side of
          the landing after reading it julieta crumples it up pina cannot
          believe it she remains motionless on the other side of the landing
          because she doesnt trust the eccentric looking woman

          

          

           pina
           indignant leave that note there! its not for you
           how dare you take it and crumple it

          

          
          julieta throws the crumpled note through the gap in the stairway and
          looks condescendingly at pina while she approaches her prepared to
          walk down the stairs

          

          

           julieta
           what do you have to speak to ivan about you whore!

           pina
           its none of your business

           julieta
           i am his wife

           pina
           his wife has been admitted at a psychiatric hospital
           for twenty years now

           julieta
           not anymore

          

          

          

          

           127

          

          up to this point we watch the sequence through the imagetexture of

          the moviola and the reflection of mateos face
          these images are what will be retained from what had been shot
          previously

          

          

          

          

          102 shooting at the stairway continued

          

          
          pina makes a gesture as if to say so you are the exwife the crazy
          one
          pina and julieta begin to descend the stairs

          

          

           julieta
           repeats i am no longer committed i am now here
           with you walking down the stairs

          

          
          pina looks at her apprehensively she steps down only one
          stair

          

          

           julieta
           you are in a hurry to see him arent you

           pina
           yes

           julieta
           well what are you waiting for!

          

          
          she pushes her and pina falls rolling all the way to the bottom

          images that indicate the passing of time during the shooting short
          sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams as if
          assembling ballet pieces all of it accompanied by a musical score
          the dp sets up the lighting for the shoot the bulbs are lit the
          filters applied the interior of the camera cleaned the film is
          loaded the atmosphere is set pina in her bedroom lying on the
          bed with one leg in a cast is relaxing breathing deeply the
          actress playing chon jokes around with the costume team they laugh
          but no one pays attention to the others edurne in a closeup
          retouches one of pinas eyes the mouth as well chon stops laughing
          so that the hairstylist may shape her hair
          all the images are very brief the score predominates the ambient
          sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a
          whisper the scene must not last longer than a minute this set of
          images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in
          its final days after a long journey
          there will probably not be many images but less the bulb that
          lights lenas eye as edurne retouches it its blinking its sadness
          chons mouth as she speaks without pause stopping only when lipstick
          is added the film loaded the hair fluffed lena lying on the rug
          in her dressing room totally motionless her eyes madeup and closed
          doing breathing exercises for relaxation her leg in a cast etc
          motor action!

          the doorbell rings in the loft pina limps over to the door she
          looks through the metal peephole its design creates an optical
          illusion on the other side of the peephole chons exalted eyes
          appear chon is a better midler type in her 40s that kind of
          extroverted woman who at first glance appears chubby but isnt quite
          so she is wearing designer clothes despite the fact that her
          demeanor is direct and crass both of them pina and chon are tired
          and hysterical which each one of them interprets in her own way
          pina opens the door and chon enters even though they are good
          friends the last thing pina is in the mood for is to see chon much
          less an overexcited chon with problems

          

          

           pina
           whispers what a drag! she opens the door in a
           languid bored tone oh its you

           chon
           reproaches depressed ive left you a thousand
           messages!

           pina

          chon notices ivans suitcase in the middle of the foyer and looks at
          it as if shed never seen a suitcase

          

          

           chon
           and this suitcase!

          

          
          judging from the tone one would guess she could care less but the
          script asks for her to inquire about the suitcase and she inquires

          

          

           pina
           sounding bored asleep its ivans hes leaving me

          chon disconcerted notices that pina drags herself around with a cast
          on her leg
          she has picked up pinas inexpressive tone

          one already inside has run out
          mateo has a look of worry the scene is not funny at all the
          actresses are bored and tense they behave like automatons lena
          looks at mateo she had never seen him so disconsolate

          

          
          a general impasse and discouragement the team betrays boredom
          preoccupation and exhaustion

          ernesto junior wanders around the set
          we suppose that he has already shot the other takes we notice a
          change in his attitude he watches lena and mateo converse then
          watches them as they move away from the set he has no intention of
          following them one might say that he is now on their side against
          his own father

          in some place of the warehouse where no one can see them and they can
          speak calmly mateo and lena
          during this time lena has been keeping her end of the deal and
          continues to live with ernesto martel but as much as she attempts to
          diffuse it its effect has been devastating she is very depressed
          she can hardly hold herself up lenas state of mind and how it
          affects the shooting makes mateo feel impotent and guilty

          

          

           lena
           distressed maybe shell cry i am sorry

           mateo
           dont worry it will turn out acknowledges but i
           dont know what more direction to give you

           lena
           exhausted hard on herself you have told me
           everything in every way possible

          

          

           132

          

           mateo
           somber and guilty ernesto is getting just what he
           hoped that we make a piece of crap of a movie! i
           told you not to agree to that deal

          

          
          lena breathes grasping for a solution and for breath she attempts
          to regain her strength

          

          

           lena
           we cant let him have his way! she dries her tears
           feeling newly replenished every day i arrive worn
           out and every day i recover right

           mateo
           acknowledges yes

           lena
           i ask you only for a bit more patience and a kiss!

          

          
          mateo kisses her as one kisses one shipwrecked although the one
          shipwrecked is really him in any case the kiss brings life back to
          both of them

          number thirteen a traveling shot follows lena as she limps toward
          the door she looks through the peephole behind it chon they are
          supposed to be good friends but shes the last person lena wants to
          see

           her oh its you

           chon
           listen if thats how youll greet me ill leave

           pina
           no cmon! come inside!

          

          
          pina treats her with a friendly disdain which plays comically she
          has once again recovered her strength and her lightness her low
          spirits have disappeared and she comes off thoughtless and impudent
          her reenactment has an effect on chon who also performs much better
          than in the previous take

          

          
          these first few phrases are enough to determine that the two actresses
          have improved lena is now a different actress light and delicious
          mateo smiles brimming with admiration

          all of mateos films they have been colleagues for a long time as

           135

           practically kidnapped her they were difficult days for
           everyone but lena insisted that i leave all the takes
           selected then we could leave

          

          
          he hasnt finished saying this when we hear the phone ring the

          surface of the sink is tainted with blood mateo looks at her
          horrified she is no longer wearing a cast a mans jacket lies on
          top of the counter this is the only piece of clothing that appears in
          this scene

          mateo and lena are living in a bungalow zone on famara beach a
          complex nestled between the beach and the foot of a mountain it is a
          special and intimate place like an enormous grotto where the sky is
          its ceiling and the mountains one of its walls

          

          
          lena and mateo exit a bungalow and get into a rented car a red opel
          corsa not in very good shape

          on the peak of a reddish rock on golfo beach mateo takes photographs
          of the natural wonders surrounding him next to him lena
          contemplates the view
          what mateo sees with his camera
          a wine colored rocks
          b the yellowgreen lake circumscribed by a rope that has become
          white against the black sand
          c the black sand of the enormous beach licked by the shimmering foam
          of the waves
          d the rocky walls enveloping the beach eroded through centuries by
          the wind on the surface of which it has created peaks and valleys
          resembling the jutted edge of a watch cog

          

          
          one of the images captures part of a winecolored rock below it the
          infinite surface of the black beach licked by the white foam of the
          waves in the backdrop an immense limestone wall its surface full of
          pit holes where the wind circulates
          the sequence ends with a closeup of the click of mateos cameras
          shutter opening and closing like an owls eye

          beach the two are melded into a tight embrace the beach is
          deserted mateo had not been aware of them when he took the
          photograph and is overtaken by his discovery
          he shows it to lena halfjoking

          

          

           mateo
           look its us i thought it was empty

          they stop on one of the stop signs at the traffic circle in the
          center there is a huge mobile sculpture by cesar manrique rocked by
          the wind
          mateo and lena exit the car to take pictures of themselves their
          faces close together their eyes happy the sculpture turning around
          itself produces a strange screeching sound

          118 bungalow famara beach int dusk or night 1994


          

          
          many days have passed mateos hair is longer and he appears more
          tan the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also
          affected magdalenas appearance now much more savage but also more
          serene and more humble she is dressed in cheap clothing which she
          has bought on the island and which fits her marvelously and her hair
          is pulled up into a messy bun

          

          
          the photograph enlarged presides on top of a small table where mateo
          writes the picture is leaning against the wall its the only image
          inside the bungalow the photograph is a clear metaphor for the
          mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of mateo
          and lena and of their fusion

          

          
          while mateo writes lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in
          the bathtub the two wear tshirts comfortable and sporty clothes
          on the tapedeck one hears la lupe singing  porque hay un hombre
          para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre y nosotros somos
          nosotros somos la pareja [because there is only one man for each
          woman and only one woman for each man and we are and we are the
          couple] mateo and magdalena the couple

          

          
          in the bungalow there isnt much furniture theres a large couch on
          which they can lie comfortably a short table along with the wooden
          table on which mateo writes some armchair and lamps and a tape
          deck
          cut to

          119 bungalow int dusk or night 1994


          

          
          engulfed by the couch mateo and lena are absorbed watching on a
          small television a broadcast of voyage in italy roberto
          rossellinis
          the scene they are watching is set in a place where a group of men are
          working on some excavation the married couple in the midst of their
          breakup played by george sanders and ingrid bergman is on a tourist
          trip in that area of italy and they have gone to visit the excavation
          one of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in
          excavating part of a city that had been buried centuries ago by the
          lethal eruption of the vesuvius
          at that moment the men who are working on the excavation begin bit
          by bit to uncover a couple a man and a woman sleeping in an
          embrace whom the eruption had taken unaware leaving them preserved
          in this position for centuries
          ingrid bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an
          eternal embrace she compares it to her own marriage destroyed by
          their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between
          them she walks away from the place unable to contain her tears
          the scene affects magdalena and mateo as much as it had ingrid
          bergman
          mateo and lena instinctively embrace each other seeking refuge in
          each other their posture echoes that of the calcined couple

          

          
          suddenly mateo breaks their embrace he positions the camera on top
          of the table where he writes not far from where the image of the
          other embrace sits he points it toward the couch and he presses
          the automatic button and they take a picture together locked in an
          embrace

           happened in lanzarote you cant leave me hanging!

          

          
          harry takes a deep breath at this stage of the narrative it is only
          understandable that diego would want to know everything but it pains
          him to think of what is still left to tell

          

          

           harry
           without realizing a month had elapsed i knew that
           sooner or later we would have to return but we kept
           postponing it i was only worried about you and your
           mother i had not even said goodbye and you were still
           suffering from your allergy problem when we left i can
           imagine judit was furious with me

           diego

           harry
           i was planning to return soon to finish the editing

          mateo and lena are walking toward the office for the bungalow complex
          part of the previous dialogue is heard as the couple are approaching

          behind the counter there are two foreign employees a man and a woman
          lena addresses them in english while mateo keeps himself busy at the
          other end of the reception hall next to a table with magazines and
          newspapers he grabs a newspaper
          in english

          

          

           lena

          with his back to the counter at the other end of the reception desk
          mateo reads a newspaper frozen
          suddenly the employee opens a national newspaper and looks for a
          particular page he shows it to lena on the entertainment page an
          ad for mateos movie opening soon the ad is a closeup of her in
          her role as pina in the movie lena is stunned she cant believe

           you

          

          
          lena looks toward where mateo is standing and she notices that he is
          as perplexed as she is staring at the ad for a soontobereleased
          film in the newspaper

          

          

           lena

          them they have just run into the very thing they have been
          attempting to escape in madrid

          a few surfers are preparing to go into the ocean a father and his
          young son toss their kites into the wind
          lounging on lounge chairs on a cobblestone area before one reaches
          the sand lena and mateoharry are reading the news of the opening of
          the film in a national newspaper they only have one copy and mateos
          eyes are transfixed on the news
          the note accompanying the event says in bold type
          the financier ernesto martel has managed to gather all of madrid
          for his first film as a producer missing are only its director and
          star
          two pictures accompany the news of the event printed next to them
          there is a review entitled disaster
          mateo throws the newspaper away from him enraged he refuses to read
          the review

          

          

           146

          
          the wind dishevels the newspaper pages lena rises and chases the
          pages that fly like kites slightly above the ground
          in midflight she catches the entertainment page and reads it as she
          approaches mateo who watches the ocean feeling impotent furious
          unable to quite grasp what is happening
          lena sits down next to him still reading

          

          

           mateo
           disconsolate what does it say

           lena
           that the only intelligent thing we have done has been
           not to attend the premier that my acting is pathetic
           that you seem like a firsttime director and that you
           lack talent at the end it wonders who might have
           made your first films never before has such a
           resounding downfall been witnessed how horrible!

          

          
          mateo rises and heads quickly for the bungalow which functions as the
          office for the complex
          lena follows him alarmed

           horrible time for me not just because of the illness
           my mother was like a crazy woman i had just seen the
           exorcist and for some time i believed she was
           possessed

           harry
           emphatically me curiosity was killing me! for
           two days i called both your mother and luis nonstop
           the editor says it agitated but neither of them
           answered! so i decided to return to madrid the next
           day so that i could witness what was happening for
           myself!

          

          

          126 restaurant el mirador [the lookout] ext dusk 1994


          

          
          night falls while they dine
          mateo and magdalena dine at el mirador a local restaurant with
          spectacular views their table is beside a long slidingdoor window
          that overlooks the valley a group of rocks seem to grow next to the
          window as if they were plants made of stone the view of the valley
          is breathtaking
          there are few patrons inside the restaurant perhaps a foreign
          couple sitting far from lena and mateo a waiter brings their first
          course they are drinking wine
          lena appears melancholic and fearful

          

          

           mateo
           how did you meet ernesto senior

           lena

          

          

           150

          
           its not a topic she likes but she doesnt hesitate
           to answer i was one of his secretaries

           mateo
           and how did you end up with him you fell in love

           lena
           he was very generous with me and my family my father
           was dying i needed to take him to a private hospital
           and ernesto took care of everything he paid for
           everything and he made sure that my parents could
           return to their home town and that they lacked nothing

          

          
          mateo imagines the situation it upsets him he is perturbed by the
          very idea of lenas past with ernesto but he doesnt want to upset
          her on the night before his departure they have gone out to dinner
          with just the opposite intent

          

          

           mateo
           lovingly pardon me i have no right to ask you about
           that time in your life

           lena
           its only natural that you would want to know and i
           dont want any skeletons between us unguarded i
           would like to be able to forget all that but you have
           the right to ask

           mateo
           assuring her no i do not have any right for me
           you were born the day you came for the audition you
           looked at me i saw your face and i was left
           hypnotized

          

          
          lena smiles she is both comforted and relived by remembering that
          moment

           151

          

           lena
           i remember your face perfectly i think i fell in
           love with the way you looked at me i thought this
           man will be my salvation

          

          
          mateo is moved by her use of those terms to speak of their first
          meeting

          they exit in an embrace and head toward their car parked nearby
          they kiss before they get in the car we notice another car which we
          will have the occasion to recall in the future the camera gives it
          just a passing glance

          

          

           lena
           childish its the first time we part

           mateo
           pampering either way i will return next weekend
           but if you are going to be worried you should come
           with me

           lena
           no i will be better off here

          

          
          and she smiles as if the worry has already passed so as not to
          disquiet mateo

          view of the sea of lava or of la geria in an aerial shot with the car
          moving across the landscape the full moon allows us to glimpse
          through the darkness of the landscape
          mateos car once again heads for the bungalow complex show the
          highway illuminated by the headlights and the landscape as it appears
          to its left and right

          

          
          from inside the car one can see the mobile sculpture of cesar
          manrique at a distance

          

          

           mateo
           very insecure and did i manage to save you from
           anything

           lena
           enigmatic and unwavering yes!

          

          
          lena does not elaborate on the dangers that mateo has saved her from
          he doesnt understand them exactly but he likes to hear her say so

          

          
          they approach the traffic circle a set of lights first betrays the
          presence of a car that appears from the left mateo yields to it and
          briefly kisses magdalena on the lips

          

          
          mateo continues on his way a short instant later as he enters the
          traffic circle an suv moving at full speed crashes into them

          

          

          

          

           153

          
          everything happens very fast from inside the car without any
          particular attention to lena or mateo the screen fills up with light
          noise and darkness all the different noises form a deafening magma

          

          
          at the center of the traffic circle cesar manriques sculpture
          rotates propelled by the wind

          

          
          in any case we will also shoot the crash from the outside and
          although it will not be obvious at first sight the back side of
          mateos car is illuminated by the headlights of a car that we never
          quite see but which has been a witness to the accident

          the huge mobile sculpture by cesar manrique continues to rotate with
          the wind immediately following the collision
          one can hear the screeching wheels of the suv escaping from the
          accident scene one also hears the sound of a second vehicle which
          approaches and stops and something that sounds like a door opening
          and a moan
          the camera only focuses on the sculpture swaying in the wind

           magdalenas death didnt catch us melded in an embrace
           but sitting on separate seats it caught me by
           surprise in that of leaving me alive

          through one of the windows we can see mateos gaunt and nebulous
          figure resting on a bed his head bandaged

          blue an aquatic color and they have various spots where humidity has
          seeped through
          other than the psychiatrist there is another doctor present
          explaining the situation to judit

          

          

           psychiatrist
           we call him by his name but he doesnt respond to it
           he insists mateo has died

           judit
           images are the source of his work and to live in the
           dark i suppose thats death to him is there any
           chance he will see

           doctor
           none his is what we refer to as a cortical
           blindness and its irreversible its the result of
           a lesion to the occipital lobe the intelligent part
           of the brain which has the role of processing all
           visual information in other words the neurons have

          sunglasses now without the bandages or very few and with little
          diego eight years old holding hands mateo walks tentatively and
          slowly he will probably be aided by the typical blind mans cane
          they get into a car that is waiting for them judit instructs the
          driver to take them to famara beach to the bungalow complex

          a cloudy and windy day

          

          
          this is a good opportunity to show some of the more dramatic
          landscapes of the island the lava sea black and twisted and the
          rented car that crosses it through the highway that divides it or
          la geria and its vine stalks buried in halfspheres of black dirt to
          protect them from the winds the green palm tree fronds flop around
          against the backdrop of this blackdirt landscape

          

          
          inside the car mateo asks judit

          

          

           mateo
           did you visit lenas mother at her hometown

           judit
           yes

           mateo
           what did she say

           judit
           she was very thankful to ernesto for having taken care
           of everything

           mateo

          

          

           157

           judit

          the car stops in front of the bungalow that functions as the
          reception desk for the complex
          judit and little diego exit judit helps mateo out
          mateo remains glued to the ground he cant move judit stares at
          him even though mateo had renounced being mateo he has inherited
          his most painful memories being near the reception bungalow and
          thus near the bungalow where he lived with magdalena generates some
          kind of spasm in him that keeps him from moving he feels an intense
          heat inside and outside of him as if he were approaching a bonfire
          the flames of which would slowly scorch him were he to move
          perhaps well have to inlay the image with the flames of an imaginary
          conflagration the face contorted

          

          

           judit
           whats wrong

           mateo

          

          

           158

          
           weakened you go i cant ill wait for you on the beach

          

          
          the idea excites little diego

          

          

           dieguito
           i also want to go to the beach!

          

          
          he approaches mateo and instinctively grabs his hand judit watches
          the couple the situation unfolds before she can stop it

          

          

           mateo
           do whatever you need to do well wait for you there

          

          
          judit is worried about the wind she buttons diegos jacket and wraps
          his scarf around him she does the same thing with mateo

          

          

           judit
           bundle up! and dont get too close to the water to
           little diego dont let go of his hand!

          

          
          little diego grabs mateos hand despite the wind the boy is excited
          about the idea of going to the beach he has just become mateos
          guide and mateo lets him guide him like a somnambulist

          day 1994

          

          
          mateo and little diego walk only a few meters past bungalow number
          two where he lived with magdalena at that moment they are walking
          facing the wind a fierce wind that threatens to tear off their
          clothes it is as if nature itself wanted to keep mateo from walking
          away from the bungalow where he loved lena from this point on his
          life will become just that an endless battle against the elements and
          against the memory of lena

          

          

           160

          
          little diegos voice distracts him

          

          

           dieguito
           look there are kites!

          

          
          at times little diego forgets that mateo cannot see so he points
          toward the sky of a nearby beach whose surface is dotted by various
          kites

          

          
          mateo is grateful for the lifeaffirming sound of the boys voice and
          so he allows himself to be towed
          the winds violent sweep over all the different elements that compose
          the landscape creates a symphony of strange sounds

          

          

          

          
          138 bungalow no2 famara int and ext day 1994

          

          
          judit using the key she was handed at the reception desk opens the
          door to bungalow number two she enters into what had been mateo and
          lenas love nest she takes the entire space in with one glance she
          is overtaken as if she has entered an ancestral and sacred space
          she imagines mateo and lena filling up the space with their presence
          a strange modesty comes over her but her curiosity is greater
          lenas spirit at least in judits mind hangs in the air but in the
          material surrounding her absence is absolute those who took her body
          did not leave any trace of lena not a single object not a single
          dress nothing ernesto seniors cohorts or ernesto himself took
          all of her things

          

          
          mateos clothes and things are found piled up in a closet yet the
          table where he sat to write remains intact on it the photograph of

          

          

           161

          
          the embrace on golfo beach still rests along with his notebook blank
          pages and some envelopes
          judit observes the photograph on golfo beach as if it were alive
          still palpitating and she imagines that the two lovers locked in an
          embrace lost in the anonymous vastness of the black sand are mateo
          and lena

          

          
          she opens the desks drawer and much to her surprise finds it
          overflowing with torn photographs of mateo and lena shuffled in no
          particular order one might say they had been thrown violently into
          the drawer the violence of the hand that ripped and threw them has
          left its pulsating mark
          judit picks up all the pieces slowly and delicately and she places
          them inside a brown envelope that she finds next to mateos notebook
          her sense of guilt is so profound that it dries out her throat and the
          expression on her face

          

          

          

          

          139 famara beach ext day 1994


          

          
          at the base of the complex on one end of the beach the car that
          brought them is waiting judit places the bags with mateos
          belongings which she has just carried from the bungalow inside the
          trunk she raises her head emotionally exhausted from where she
          stands she can see little diego ecstatic in front of a group of
          surfers wearing brilliant colors traversing the waves and a group of
          kites around eight or ten darting through the sky like flying fish
          mateo is motionless in front of the sea soaking up its strength

          

          
          judits pain is at odds with the boys joy and the overwhelming
          vitality that the place exudes at that very moment

          

          

           162

          
          she begins to walk toward mateo and little diego once she is a few
          meters away she observes a surfer riding a wave in the foreground
          of her line of sight stands mateo out of focus as he comes into
          focus judit yells out to him

          

          

           judit
           harry! harry caine!

          

          
          it seems as though she is invoking the wind a hurricane which moves
          the waves along with the expert surfers riding them
          when he hears judits voice mateo turns to face in her direction and

          responds

          

          

           harry
           were here judit! and raises his hand like a child

          

          
          judit approaches them petrified with emotion the wind tears tears
          from her eyes

          

          

           judit
           we have to go harry

           harry

           dieguito

           163

          
          judit walks in front of the blind man and the boy her eyes glitter
          mateo has responded to her call and that has filled her with
          uncontrollable emotion at this very moment she decides that she will
          dedicate her life exclusively to the care of this man this is how it
          will be

          diego is still sitting on the floor next to the brown envelope he
          sticks on the braille title famara lanzarote 94 in front of him
          spread on the floor like a puzzle lie the pieces of various embraces
          between mateo and lena like archeological finds like the minoan
          paintings in crete the pieces begin to join with one another an
          order is established and soon the better part of the picture is
          clear there are four photographs where regardless of the missing
          pieces one can make out the image two are of embraces and the rest
          are of domestic scenes the scratches on the four photographs reveal
          the passing of time

          endearing appearance she is a little chubby well dressed according
          to her age forty and her profession a counselor for social affairs
          spontaneous and direct she is kind of a bette midler in her forties
          but the actress is lacking grace and her restlessness reveals more
          about her fear of running into the moving camera than about the very
          funny way that the character inhabits her own anxiety lena is also
          quite languid lacking spark tired and unenthusiastic as a comedy
          its without charm and as a drama its uninteresting thats what
          the critics said

          with the same fury with which he had thrown down the newspaper with
          the bad review of his film onto the sand he abruptly shuts off the
          television monitor
          he remains suspended for a few moments as if trying to find an
          explanation for what he has just heard was he so caught up in
          magdalenas problems that he was unable to distinguish when a take was
          good or bad

          breaking dawn enters through the corners of the drapes that cover the
          windows
          he opens the drawer with the photographs when diego had opened it
          before we had been able to see that along with the photographs there
          were other objects for example luis notebook the editor diego
          had not mentioned any of this to harry harry pokes around in the
          drawer with his hands finds the notebook
          he grabs it he opens it on top of his desk he touches the
          different pages the tips of his finger tips run over the numbers
          corresponding to the sequences the shots the selected takes
          attempting to find a message

           that perhaps he had something to tell me would you
           mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there

          152 judit and diegos home int day 2008


          

          
          judit returns from location scouting she enters her house she hugs
          her son effusively

          

          
          she drops a large suitcase with wheels the sequence takes place in
          various rooms in the house from the foyer she should move toward the
          bedroom or the kitchen where she makes herself some tea or where she
          opens bags full of food that shes brought typical to the region
          shes just visited she looks inside the refrigerator and doesnt
          find anything things like that

          

          

           judit
           i was dying to see you! are you ok my son

           diego
           yes

           judit
           i was very worried about you!

           diego
           mateo has looked after me day and night

           judit
           mateo youre not calling him harry

          

          
          diego had not realized

          

          

           diego
           yes

           judit

          

          

           175

          
           todays his birthday we must get him something what
           have you been up to all this time

           diego
           nothing watching movies and talking

           judit
           as if it were something strange talking

           diego
           yes

           judit
           what about

           diego
           mom please!

          

          
          judit looks at her son she finds him different as if all the
          confidences shared with harry had left a physical and visible mark on
          him diego seems to guess what his mother is thinking

          

          

           judit
           ok so what happened to you sort of joking i
           dont know if i should believe the thing about the
           stomach flu you two used that as an excuse in a
           script

           diego
           elusive i suffered  an accident but i would
           rather not speak of that right now

           judit
           irritated by the surprise what kind of accident

           diego
           its hard to explain

           judit
           orders him annoyed try to! i am not that stupid!

           diego

           176

          
           lets leave it for another time yes i am all well now

          

          
          judit gets the sense that she can no longer speak to her son in the
          same way that she could before she left on her trip those two weeks
          have irreversibly changed him

          

          

           judit
           whats wrong with you diego

           diego
           nothing im doing just fine im going to buy a
           present for mateo

           judit
           repeats for mateo

           diego
           alright harry

          

          
          offended she doesnt want her son to think she is a drag so she
          makes an effort not to bombard him with questions

          

          

           judit
           call him however you wish thats the advantage of
           having two names

          

          
          diego disappears and leaves her in midsentence
          is this his way of avenging himself perhaps his reaction is unfair
          but he cannot stand to stay there with his mother answering thousands
          of questions regarding an accident when there has been another
          accident that he is much more intrigued by and that she has kept
          silent for fourteen years

          mateo and judit talk they are sitting on a sofa the conversation is
          already midway

          

          

           judit
           thank you for looking after diego i dont know how to thank
           you!

           mateo
           youve been looking after me for fourteen years now

          

          
          judit brushes his acknowledgement off with a halfsmile

           178

          
           ive found him somewhat hostile he left without
           telling me what it was that happened will you tell
           me

           mateo
           i dont know it should be your son to tell you

          

          
          judit is upset by both of their evasiveness

          

          

           judit
           what is wrong with the two of you why is it that he
           suddenly is not calling you harry but mateo

           mateo
           he evades the first question but responds to the
           second one two weeks ago at the place where he
           djs by mistake he grabbed a friends drink that
           had been spiked with ghb liquid ecstasy he
           thought it was his drink both drinks had cocacola

           judit
           liquid ecstasy

           mateo
           yes its a very dangerous drug when its mixed with
           alcohol and diego had already had two cuba libres
           before he drank from his friends glass

           judit
           and what happened exactly

           mateo
           being vague he was badly affected he spent two
           days in urgent care after that i brought him here

          

          
          judit looks at him horrified she cant seem to comprehend such a
          turbulent and simple story

          

          

           179

          

           judit
           diegos a drug addict

           mateo
           no ive told you he drank from the glass containing
           liquid ecstasy by mistake

           judit
           but how can one make a mistake with something like
           that

           mateo
           at first glace one cannot tell the difference both
           glasses contained cocacola its not the first time
           it happens

          

          
          judit sighs defenseless and horrified

          

          

           mateo
           diego has not told you so that you wouldnt be alarmed

           judit
           that i wouldnt be alarmed! well he hasnt
           succeeded at some point he will have to speak to me
           no

           mateo
           he is wanting to do so!

          

          
          judit takes a cigarette out of its box and lights it

          

          

           judit
           is that so because i ask him and he doesnt answer!

           mateo
           then you should try answering him when he asks you

          

          

          

          

           180

          
          judit smokes in silence she is curious to know what mateo and diego
          have been talking about in her absence but she doesnt dare ask
          mateo

          

          

           judit
           the two of you are acting very differently both of
           you you both have changed

          

          
          she laments it as if she had been put aside and they had not taken
          her into account

          at the bar before one enters the restaurant
          judit and mateo are having something to drink mateo tilts his head
          subtly in front of judit

          

          

           mateo
           you smell good

           judit
           insecure i have put on some makeup and i am dressed
           as a woman

           mateo
           whats the dress like

          

          
          judit describes it with few words and almost shyly

          

          

           mateo

          

          

           181

          
           and the hair how are you wearing your hair its
           been so long since ive asked you that i dont even
           know whether its long or short

          

          
          the fact that mateo betrays that type of interest flatters and
          disconcerts her

          

          

           judit
           i havent changed much harry i am wearing my hair short

           mateo
           short like jean seberg in breathless like joan of
           arc on the bonfire like liza minnelli in cabaret
           or like yul brynner

           judit
           short or rather very short like that of all
           fortysomethings who want to appear younger

           mateo
           i am sure it looks good on you thanks for dressing up
           for me judit

          

          
          diego looks at them amused he hands mateo three dvds scorseses
          goodfellas or the coen brothers fargo tarantinos kill bill
          and kiarostamis taste of cherry
          near them on the bar table two couples talk excitedly as if they
          were about to go on a ride at an amusement park

          

          
          the barman tells them they may now enter

          once theyve crossed the doorway a man signals them to follow him
          hes a blind man that like mateo moves smoothly he knows the place
          by heart
          the restaurant is completely shrouded in darkness all the waiters
          men and women are blind the one in charge of mateo diego and
          judit introduces himself

          

          

           javier
           my name is javier how many are you

           mateo
           three

          

          
          there is not a single light inside the following sequences take
          place in absolute darkness

          

          

           javier
           please grab onto each others shoulders and follow me
           in indianfile i will guide you to your table its
           number eight

           judit
           what is the idea here harry

           mateo
           we are dinning in darkness

           javier
           you didnt know this maam

           judit
           anxious feeling slightly ridiculed no

           javier
           you should have been warned but dont worry people
           get used to it after a few minutes

          they have arrived to their table as signaled by the waiter table
          number eight he tells them where to sit

          

          

           javier
           imagine that your plate is the face of a watch your
           silverware is at 9h and at 3h your glass at 1h
           bread at 11h

          

          
          each of them reaches for the objects as indicated by the waiter around
          an imaginary clock

          

          
          judit still believes this is some kind of joke and that the lights
          will come on at any moment and that something spectacular will appear
          before her eyes
          if she had been able to see she would have been witness to the very
          interesting scenes surrounding her two couples kissing with bestial
          enjoyment and a wellbred woman performing fellatio on the man
          sitting next to her no one sees them except our camera

          

          

           judit
           harry what is all this about

          

          
          the waiter responds

          

          

           javier
           we want our clients to discover that the lack of sight
           harnesses the other senses touch taste smell and
           sound will acquire a special intensity tonight maam
           i hope youll enjoy them

          

          

           184

          
          judit says nothing she hides her nervousness in order not to ruin
          mateos night he seems fascinated with the place and completely
          unaware of the process she is now living the discovery of absolute
          darkness a bottomless pit

          

          

           javier
           will the gentlemen be drinking something

           mateo
           bring us a bottle of wine to toast

          

          
          the waiter leaves them
          slowly judit begins to walk the plank that will plunge her into
          anxiety the evening feels far from a party but she doesnt want to
          spoil it for either mateo or diego she hears mateo explaining to

          him

          

          

           mateo
           i found out about this place in the newspaper and i
           wanted to check it out

           diego
           its a german idea there are various restaurant like
           this one theyre totally in fashion

           judit
           cant believe what shes hearing darkness in
           fashion i dont understand

          

          
          silence judit pours herself some water and drinks and she gets
          depressed in silence
          she lights a cigarette

          javier the waiter arrives with the wine he tells judit she cant
          smoke she puts out the cigarette on the floor
          to enliven the occasion diego proposes a toast

          

          

           diego
           lets toast!

           judit
           yes lets toast

          

          
          mateo pours the glasses they each grab one clumsily they bring
          them close until they can her the sound of the crystal clinking

          

          

           diego
           happy birthday!

           judit
           happy birthday! we must look into each others eyes
           she has already said it and its too late when she
           thinks of retracting it

           diego
           well were kind of screwed

           judit
           oh sorry it slipped

          

          
          they attempt to clink glasses it is not such an easy task the
          three glasses head for each other in the darkness it would have been
          easiest to have all three meet at the center but instead each opts to
          find the other only mateo puts his forward and leaves it in place
          waiting for the other two to find his when this happens judits
          glass collides with too much force breaks his glass and wine spills

          

          

           186

          
          all over the table cloth mateo attempts to make light of the
          situation as if nothing had happened he presses his fingers into
          the wine that has spilled on the tablecloth and exclaims

          

          

           mateo
           joy! joy! to judit bring your ear to me so that i
           can sprinkle some wine behind it its for good luck!

          

          
          judit attempts to heed his request she leans forward offering her

          to clean up the tables once in a while they look over at the only

           judit
           i dont know what youve been talking about these past
           days

          

          
          a topic which they have waited to broach since she arrived from her
          trip
          neither of the two men respond but they are both made uncomfortable
          by the comment

          

          

           judit
           but i do know what i havent talked to you about all
           these years

          

          
          mateo directs his face toward her surprised and polite

          

          

           mateo
           ive never asked you

           judit
           but you must have asked yourself a thousand times
           this is my birthday gift mateo to diego the gift
           is also for you diego

          she takes another sip to draw courage but shes already gathered
          enough momentum

          

          

           judit
           to mateo after you disappeared ernesto senior
           thought only of his revenge a plan had occurred to
           him but to carry it out he had to bribe at the very
           least both luis and me it wasnt an issue we both
           sold ourselves without hesitation luis and i with
           me he had the courtesy to provide an alibi he
           proposed that i leave for a month and a half to the
           united states to the mayo clinic so that diego could
           undergo a cure for his aspergillosis that way i
           wouldnt have to be present while he destroyed the
           movie because that was his plan to make a mess out
           of the film i opted to stay in madrid and have
           diego undergo his cure here i wanted to witness
           everything if i was going to betray you i wanted to
           pay the full price

           mateo
           what a living hell! for both of you!

           diego
           you said it!

          

          
          she takes a deep breath and continues

          

          

           judit
           yes it was torture to watch ernesto select the worst
           takes of each shot and luis edit them together turning
           your film into a monster briefly tears the only
           way of withstanding that was to suffer more

           189

          
           overcome i sold myself to ernesto because of my pain
           and jealousy i couldnt take it and i couldnt then
           forgive you for having abandoned cinearte with lena
           without saying a word! my betrayal was my revenge
           against you against her and against myself the only
           innocent one was diego to diego forgive me my
           son for the bitterness that youve had to absorb all
           these years no one deserves to grow up like this

          judit rises she approaches the bar table she orders another gin
          andtonic the waiter doesnt dare to tell her theyve already
          closed so he serves her
          with the glass in her hand judit returns to the table where mateo and
          diego wait expectantly
          she has observed them whispering but she hasnt heard what they have
          said she sits down with them
          judit takes a sip

          

          

           mateo
           interrupts her dont continue judit! its not necessary

           judit
           yes now that you once again call yourself mateo i
           have no excuse

          

          
          judit takes a sip from her drink to gather her strength

           no one knew where you were we had no idea ernesto
           senior put everything together the premier all that
           ruckus to see if youd react his revenge was
           pointless if neither of you found out about it
           pauses ernesto asked me constantly if i knew where
           you were but i said that i also didnt know anything
           which was true

           mateo
           somber thats why i never called you but even if
           you dont believe it i was very worried for you and
           the boy

           judit
           i believe you

          

          
          diego attempts to say that he too believes him but judit doesnt
          give him time

          

          

           judit
           ernesto hired various detectives to search for you but
           before they found you you called me two days after
           the premier slowly debilitated i was too
           embarrassed to answer and too stunned i still am
           when ernesto senior asked me again about you i dont
           know why i gave him the phone number for famara

          

          
          mateo and diego listen to her with renewed attention this new
          information reveals an unexpected possibility something that neither
          of the two men had considered their reaction toward judits painful
          declaration changes in character in mateos case his compassion
          vanishes and is replaced by doubt now incited by new suspicions

          

          

           judit

           191

          
           ernesto sent his son to find you in lanzarote

          

          
          images of ernesto junior inside a rented car following the couple
          across various places on the island including the highway that leads
          to famara on that last night

          

          

           judit
           he was the one who found you after the accident and
           called the hospital

           diego
           did he have something to do with the accident

           judit
           no! but i cant stop thinking that had i not given his
           father the phone number perhaps nothing would have
           happened

           mateo
           dryly why do you think that

           judit
           i dont know

           mateo
           categorically if you dont know then stop torturing
           yourself

          

          
          he says this with spite and somewhat disparagingly for judit its
          like a splash of cold water to the face

          

          
          the confession rather than ending as a liberating catharsis has
          devolved in its opposite the silence is weighed down by suspicion
          and the new abyss between mateo and judit
          never before has judit felt mateo this distant and antagonistic her
          dramatic confession far from liberating her has opened new wounds

          

          

           192

          
          and generated new suspicions and judit feels taken over by an arid

          before she opens the door she bends over and retches violently
          diego gets out of the car and holds her by the waist he attempts to
          help her
          judits face is contorted she wipes a thread of saliva still hanging
          from her lips despite the retching she has not vomited anything
          other than liquid

          diego finds the purse in the car and hands it to her immediately
          judit searches through the purse impatiently she takes the purse
          and drops all of its contents on the sidewalk she find a box of
          tranquilizers the pill she presses through the aluminum seal comes
          out with a pop she places it on her tongue she leans over the car
          diego looks at her scared he has never seen her like this
          articulating poorly so as to not move her tongue judit say to him

          sleeping pills she has overcome the crisis
          diego looks at her very concerned his mother has never shown
          herself to be so physically fragile he wants to help her but it
          doesnt seem like there is anything more he can do than what he
          already has
          judit attempts to smile in order to calm him

          

          

           judit
           i will sleep well with this

          envelopes with money a jump drive the mp3 etc he goes through it

          handwritten his own telephone number on the note he goes over it
          with his fingertips as if he could see through them

          his body toward the modeling agency but no one there enters or exits
          whose odor or whose clacking heels rings familiar
          there are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all

          diego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and judit he
          works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a
          generous and varied breakfast toast juice coffee and tea
          marmalade toasted bread spread with oil and tomato etc
          judit appears through one of the kitchen doors calm with a look of
          having rested but also with the hangover of having survived a
          nightmarish day the day before diego does not hear her approach
          the mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender
          smile when diego turns to look the tenderness disappears a little
          more out of modesty and a lack of habit in any case judit enjoys
          the peacefulness of the moment her son caring for her after the
          storm
          judit looks over the culinary display

          

          

           judit
           how impressive!

           diego
           i am specializing in breakfasts i would do the same
           for mateo

          

          
          judits expression changes now a bit more somber

          

          

           diego
           are you ok

           judit
           yes still a bit beaten down dont worry about last
           night its horrible but it only happens occasionally
           and i know how to stop it

           diego
           it scared me it seemed as though an alien would pop
           out of your stomach

           judit

           198

          
           its not a bad way of describing a panic attack
           changing the topic one can tell shes made the
           decision before she arrived in the kitchen diego
           there was one last thing i didnt tell you yesterday

          

          
          assuming it will be painful he attempts to dissuade her

           diego
           in a love affair

           judit
           yes we were just getting started in film and we are
           still at it but our love affair ended at least on his
           side that didnt keep us from working together
           until now

           diego
           i knew all that or i imagined it

           judit
           theres one more thing mateo is your father

          

          

           199

          
          diego looks at her astonished

          

          

           diego
           and that fleeting lover my supposed biological
           father you made him up

           judit
           no i can hide things but i never make things up
           i dont know how to make up the fleeting lover
           existed he was gay and our affair was shortlived
           his name was vicente and it was while i was with him
           that you were conceived but your biological father
           was mateo not vicente

          

          
          still thinking about what he has just heard diego places the
          breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of
          tea judit begins to drink it one tiny sip at a time

          

          

           diego
           assimilates the news he is not displeased does
           mateo know

           judit
           no at that time he asked me and i denied it of
           course i didnt want to put pressure on him i
           didnt want our relationship to change because of it
           after all i had never asked him if he wanted to
           become a father

          

          
          the pieces begin to fall together

          

          

           diego
           i see

           judit

           have the rest of our lives for recriminations

          

          
          diego remains pensive for a moment

          

          

           diego
           i will not recriminate you i think i like being
           mateos son the son of a bitch  speaking of he

           judit
           what did he want

           diego
           for you to call him as soon as you could

           judit
           surprised tense that i call him why in the world
           have you not awakened me!

           diego

           sleep he didnt say it was urgent you can call him
           now

          

          
          judit grabs her sons phone agitated once again and dials mateos
          number

          in the beginning the shot is close up and so we are not aware of where
          he is all one can see is a bit of a curtain out of focus

          

          
          phone conversation

          

          

           judit
           attempts to appear calm since her confession her
           voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker
           diego has told me to call you are you ok do you need
           anything this is what shes most worried about

           mateo
           almost with irony i am not alright judit and yes
           i do need something the forty thousand meters of
           negative we shot during my last film in order to edit
           it i am at the home of ernesto junior and i just
           found out the material was destroyed in 94 i
           imagined something like this i just didnt think it
           would have happened that soon

           judit
           with urgency let me explain

           mateo
           cuts her off no i am in a hideous mood judit
           and i dont want to take it out on you!

           judit
           surprised and alarmed what are you doing at
           ernestos house

          

          

          

          

           202

          
          the shot opens up and we discover ernesto junior at the other end of
          the room next to a 16mm camera on a tripod recording everything
          that mateo says and does while he searches around in some drawers

          

          

           mateo
           i think i am going to bribe him we need money i
           dont want diego back at that damn bar i want to pay
           diego a salary we need money and he has money to
           throw

          the studio has a different configuration than when his father lived
          but we recognize the place nonetheless when the father was alive the
          space served a different purpose
          ernesto looks at mateo fearlessly he is still determined to search
          urgently for something inside the drawers of a chest the place is a
          pretty big mess

          

          

           judit
           mateo stop talking crazy!

           mateo
           it is not craziness i cant think of anyone else to
           blame for magdalenas death

           judit
           my god! she asks diego to bring her the box of
           tranquilizers wait a second i have something to
           tell you

           mateo
           let it be you already said enough last night

           judit

           203

          
           she takes a pill and yells at him listen to me
           mateo! as she raises her voice she becomes
           dominant i was the production director if you want
           to know anything about the footage ask me!

           mateo
           since you insist i will ask you what do you have to
           tell me

           judit
           in effect ernesto senior asked for it to be
           destroyed

           mateo
           in 94! very shortly after the release of that
           aberration

           judit
           yes in any case sooner or later the lab disposes of
           all the material and that was many years ago

           mateo
           thats not anything that i dont already know

           judit
           as the films producer i was the only one who had
           access to the lab to all the material after i gave
           the order to have everything destroyed i intercepted
           it and i kept it i have all of it at home

           mateo
           you are lying to me

           judit
           i didnt tell you this last night because i didnt
           realize you wanted to edit it i took everything all
           the double takes the internegative the sound tapes
           everything! you can have it whenever you want!

          

          
          the silence on the other end of the line reassures her

           204

          

           mateo
           that changes everything

           judit
           begs please get out of that place leave ernesto
           alone he had nothing to do with this

          

          
          mateo looks over at ernesto junior the camera is still on its
          tripod rolling

          

          

           mateo
           i am not so sure he has yet to explain what he was
           doing in lanzarote ill let you go it seems he
           wants to talk hangs up

          

          
          ernesto finally finds a dvd he has it in his hand and brings it
          toward mateo his hand enters into view on the screen of the 16mm
          camera

          

          

           ernesto j
           here is a copy of the making of

           mateo
           and why would i want that i cant watch it! plus
           im not interested

          

          
          ernesto takes his hand and places the dvd softly onto it

          

          

           ernesto j
           have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it
           this dvd proves that i wasnt responsible for the
           accident oh and even if my father had asked me to

          

          

           205

          
           harm you i never would have you are very important
           to me mateo

          

          
          ernesto speaks naturally for the first time mateo takes him
          seriously

          diego is watching the images of the making of while mateo works out
          on his treadmill
          at the last moment an instant prior to being struck by the suv mateo
          and lena kiss inside the car they are then distracted by a noise
          from the car that is about to hit them these images have been
          recorded from inside a different car which has been following them
          from behind at a safe distance ernesto juniors car
          mateo reaches the living room from the other end of the house
          dripping with sweat
          diego has just watched the kiss and the accident he rewinds and he
          pauses right at the moment when mateos and lenas kiss fills the
          whole screen

          

          

           mateo
           is there something new i should know about

           diego
           surprised and moved its a very interesting
           documentary and yes in effect ernesto followed
           you to lanzarote until the last moment

           mateo
           the images are there

           diego

          

          

           206

          
           yes

           mateo
           those of the last night

          

          
          they take a look at the images that ernesto taped at el mirador from
          the outside through the glass of the large window we see lena and
          mateo talking

          

          

           diego
           yes he recorded you at a safe distance while you
           were on you way back after dinner the scene is lit
           by the light of his headlights its not a lot but
           enough to see what happened not only did he not have
           anything to do with the accident he saved your life

          

          
          mateo watches the screen of the television without being able to see
          it taking in the information diego gives him

          

          

           diego
           and one more e thing when you were at the traffic
           circle before the suv crashed into to you you and
           lena kiss

           mateo
           a kiss i dont remember it

           diego
           it was an ordinary kiss just one more of the many
           kisses a couple gives each other almost without
           thinking

           mateo
           pensive the last kiss

           diego

          

          

           207

          
           yes even if it sounds cheesy someone has to tell
           you lena did not die in your arms as you dreamed
           but the last sensation she experienced in this world
           was the taste of your mouth

          

          
          mateo watches without seeing the television he gets close to the
          screen with his fingertips he caresses the surface literally
          touching lenas last kiss
          shots of mateos hand caressing the screen with the image of the
          kiss shot of diego observing the entirety of the scene moved a
          shot of everything the appropriate kind of music accompanies the
          scene as it begins to fade out bit by bit while a sign appears
