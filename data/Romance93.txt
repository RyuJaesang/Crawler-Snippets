          jane is sitting crosslegged completely absorbed in her
          book  a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant she runs
          her finger over it we hear the sound of great waves
          plunging on to a shore

          jane bites him hard at that moment mrs reed appears on
          the scene john screams we see mrs reeds shocked face
          she is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright
          elaborate dress

          dinah and mary are gently taking janes soaking clothes
          off one at each side of her jane is distressed
          approaching a delirium she resists them
                         
                         
          int dusk gateshead  the red room
                         
          jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two
          servants miss abbot and bessie  one at each side of her
          she is still resisting
                         
                          bessie
           for shame hitting your master
                         
                          miss abbot
           if you dont sit still you must
           be tied down!
                         
          the fight goes out of jane she sits defeated bessie
          young and plump quickly wipes her bleeding forehead she
          has some compassion miss abbot has none
                         
                          bessie
           what we do is for your own good
           if you are passionate and rude
           like this your aunt reed will
           send you away

          the door slams they are gone jane slowly grips the edge
          of the stool the room is chill silent red walls and
          curtains murky in the fading light
                         
          in front of jane a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth
          beside it a full length lookingglass in which her pale
          reflection stares out behind her a bed supported on
          pillars of mahogany hung with red

          the piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white
          janes breathing is the only sound in the room
                         
          a sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
          fingernails a distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
          the black hearth jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
          pitted mirror her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
          the mirrors visionary hollow her white bleeding face
          her eyes glittering with fear
                         
          it is a phantom the eyes are black the skin a deathly
          grey blood janes breathing becomes choked with terror
          she cant get her breath we hear blood rushing through her
          ears it sounds like the beating of great wings
                         
          slowly a light appears over her it may be something
          shining in from outside but to jane it seems as if it is
          surrounding her enveloping her the figure in the looking
          glass opens its mouth the scream held in so long finally
          rips from janes throat
                         
                         
          int dusk gateshead  the fireside
                         
          at the sound of the scream mrs reed slumbering almost
          jumps out of her skin
                         
                         
          int dusk gateshead  the kitchen
                         
          miss abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying
                         
                         
          int dusk gateshead  a corridor
                         
          jane is banging on the door screaming hysterical with
          terror bessie rushes to the door and unlocks it jane
          flies into her arms

          we see bessies own fear as she glances into the dark room
          mrs reed is storming towards them furious

          lace embroidery or fine crochet the whole room is an

          steep steps are revealed grace climbs them and disappears

          the exercise is lifting her spirits the sun is sinking
          turning the frost gold
                         
                         
          ext day a frozen wood
                         
          a brook runs close to the path half frozen its slow
          trickle is the only sound to be heard jane moves slowly
          acutely aware of everything around her
                         
          further into the wood the brook has frozen right across
          the path jane slips on it as she passes the noise of her
          feet echoes she steadies herself
                         
          she gazes at a huddle of snowdrops their heads bowed a
          crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
          begins to freeze as she watches it is held suspended as if
          the whole winter is contained in it
                         
          the moon is mounting the sky jane hears a sound like the
          beating of wings the blood is rushing through her ears
                         
          her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog  which
          glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet
          the beating is loud not wings she realises but the rush
          of an approaching horse it is almost on top of her before
          she can move her shocked pale face her black garments
          startle both horse and rider

           what the deuce 
                         
          the rider gets the horse under control and continues only
          to have his horse slip on the ice both man and horse fall
          with a crash the dog begins to bark until the hills echo
          with the sound the horse is on one side the man is lying
          trapped beneath it on the ice edward fairfax rochester

           command me just because youre
           older your claim to superiority
           depends on the use youve made of

           there are few masters whod
           trouble to enquire whether their

           that mercenary ground will you
           consent to speak with me as my
           equal  without thinking that the
           request arises from insolence
                         
                          jane
           id never mistake informality for
           insolence sir one i rather
           like the other nothing free

          door open a door shuts at the end of the corridor

          matting flickering in the draft jane picks it up she
          notices something else  a curling wreath of grey smoke
          she follows its trail through the pitch darkness it is
          coming thickly from a halfopen door at the front of the
          house  rochesters

          the windows and opens them smoke billows out she stands
          in the moonlight coughing

           we can overcome every kind of human
           weakness a year ago i was myself
           intensely miserable i considered
           my life was so wretched that it
           must be changed  or i would die
           after a season of darkness and
           struggling light broke i heard my
           call from god put your trust in
           him jane let him lead you to your
           future

          jane moves involuntarily towards him
                         
           st john contd
           dont pity me i have no compassion
           whatsoever for you i regarded this
           love as a fever of the flesh not a
           thing that would ever touch my
           soul i scorned the weakness
           fought hard against it  and won
                         
          jane is incredulous st john is at her desk it is covered

           i could have listened to
           temptation sunk down in the silken
           snare and known a feverish and
           delusive bliss i could have
           squandered my future upon it

          except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by
          the fire smoking a pipe grace poole leah and one of the
          hired under cooks are talking abut her

          back in a dark corner
                         
          there is an approach of chatter a subdued vivacity a
          flurry of multicoloured silks lace and velvets go by they
          descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist

          on to her lap a beaded purse she does not lift her eyes
          from the beads fully feeling the humiliation of her class 
          and of her love blanche sidles up to rochester

           points to pursue trifles you were
           utterly downhearted when i told you
           that you were rich and now for a
           matter of no moment you are
           deliriously happy

                          jane

                          jane
           because i would inevitably come to
           conceive love for you because you
           are so talented and good because
           there is such grandeur in your
           look you wouldnt want this
           strange and torturing love if i
           showed it you would find it
           unbecoming and my lot would be
           wretched

           mrs fairfax vo
           shut himself up like a hermit he
           only went out at night when he
           walked like a ghost through the
           grounds
                         
          we see what he is looking at an open carriage piled with
          luggage into which mrs fairfax is helping adele leah and

           it was harvest time when it
           happened no one knows how she
           got out
                         
          rochester hears a cry from the top floor he sets off a
          look of finality on his face

           mrs fairfax vo
           my theory is that when mrs poole

           of the gin and water

          for jane to see his scarred eyes she walks towards him
          silent
                         
          a few drops of rain begin to fall rochester puts out his
          right hand to feel them he raises his face up to the sky
          as if he is looking for something from there he is
          absolutely still his expression serene
                         
          jane is very close she steps on a twig it breaks with a
          loud crack shattering the silence rochester is
          immediately on guard his expression turning wary

          it passing an inch from her face jane steps back
          rochester swipes again she holds her breath
                         
          he seems satisfied at last that nothing is there he turns
          and walks fifteen paces back to the house he disappears
          into the dark interior
                         
          jane starts to breathe again
