insects no visible traces of toxic waste a butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized

nowhere

the decor is an odd mix of vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist charlie the parrot sits on a perch

                           charlie vo
             charlie dont surf!

mike and joshua stand near the spider tanks a dozen
aquariums on low shelves each glass tank replicates a
specific environment jungle desert cavern pond etc

                           joshua
                    dims tank lights
             the sun is going down my
             nocturnal hunters its time to
             come out and feed

mike watches joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank

                          mike
             yeah theyre definitely getting
             bigger

                           joshua
             ive calculated a growth factor of
             twelve percent over the last
             fortyeight hours but that seems
             to be accelerating

                                                continued

                                                           4

             all from eating these bugs   maybe
             i should try some

mike pauses at the desert tank watching a cricket search
for food a trapdoor spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jackinthebox the arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond

mike looks in another tank where ogreeyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects

                           mike
             run little guys

                           joshua
             they cant outrun the food chain

                           mike
             i could get away

                           joshua
             imagine yourself the size of that
             fly a scytodes spitter would be
             as big as a cadillac youd be
             spider chow kid

mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets he moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel

                           mike
             are the new tarantulas in here

                           joshua
             took me forever to get a breeding
             set of chilean reds i must have
             bribed every customs agent from
             vegas to santiago

joshua unveils the    tank dirt floor several burrow
entrances joshua     pours in the bugs a large male
tarantula comes out    of a burrow it pounces on a bug
then wraps its prey    in webbing turning the insect into a
mummylike bundle

                           mike
             that is too cool

                           joshua
             male tarantulas compete for the
             females attention
                           more

                                                 continued

                                                           5

                           joshua contd
             each one tries to bring her the
             best present bugs rats even
             the occasional parrot

charlie squawks

                           joshua
             the prey is cocooned alive so she
             can eat them in her nest you
             know how women love breakfast in
             bed

joshua leads mike to the back of the tank a network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed the male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings

                           joshua
             take a look the female of the
             species is three times as big as
             the male

mike peers into a large den the female tarantula steps
out of the shadows this is consuela the chilean red
tarantula

                           joshua
             say hello to consuela

mike watches consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles she begins to eat the paralyzed insect within

                           joshua
             she fills her prey with digestive
             acid to liquify the internal
             organs now watch shell drink
             her victim from the inside out
             while its still alive!

                           mike
                    looks queasy
             and you wonder why my mom doesnt
             like me hanging out with you

                           joshua
             arachnids have been roaming the
             earth for millions of years and
             theyll be here long after the
             human race is dead and buried

suddenly consuela lunges at the glass     mike recoils

                            mike
             bad!   bad consuela!

consuela backs up apparently she can be intimidated

                                                        6

tarantula pov  mike

the multieyed spiders panoramic vision mike looms
large at the edge of the glass wagging his finger

mike stares into the many eyes of consuela

                        mike

          the parrot

charlie squawks hungrily    the sound of a car horn

                        joshua
          theres your mom

                        mike

the entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside
a pickup truck is parked nearby the faded logo on the
door reads mccormick and son mining company
prosperity nv


int mine shaft  day

rotten beams chipped walls a generator powers a
string of lightbulbs a lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel

chris mccormick 30s has rugged good looks weathered
clothing dirtstained face ripped muscles

chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe as it makes
contact the occasional spark flies up chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmetlight

something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him

chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker he chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face his smile
fades

                           chris

chris bends over reaching for a bottle of water a
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away chriss
sack lunch

chris grabs his pickaxe and goes after the rat the
rodent dodges every hit sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock these ignite a vent of methane gas

a brief explosion knocks chris off his feet he notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch

                           chris
             hope you like bologna!

deeply trying to siphon away the blockage

beverly removes the hose a faint rumbling sound she
puts it back in her mouth and sucks a solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth then another
and another a dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth

beverly yanks it out water spews from her mouth and out

mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance
this one is plugged with concrete the tracks dont go
there they stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby

mike takes a closer    look something doesnt seem right
an odd demarcation    in the soil his fingers trace the
edge of a thin film    of material it is a lid of sorts
a sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt mike is
able to lift it

             joshua was feeding his spiders
             bugs from the creek and they
             were getting bigger

                           mike
                    agitated
             what if they didnt stop growing
             what if they broke out of their
             tanks ate joshua and went into
             the mines

sam looks at him like hes out of his mind

                           mike
             that could be why the other
             species are coming out into the
             open theyre trying to get away
             from the giant spiders
                    a beat

int museum  kitchen  day

the basement door is wide open gladys mixes food in a
bowl a cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip

a male tarantula moves across the ceiling the creature
is the size of a pit bull two quivering palps flank
dartsized fangs multiple eyes the size of quarters
hair all over

                                                 continued

gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her as
she works the spider shadows her every time the spider
is about to strike she goes another direction to get
spices utensils a pan

gladys places her bowl on the stove suddenly the
tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her
gladys shrieks the tarantula lashes out at her gladys
grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward the spider reels striking the burner
knobs turning on the gas

gladys registers the sound of escaping gas she looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it as she
goes the tarantula fires a webline at her

gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home

gladys strains with all    her might finally slots the
fuse she turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see
the broken burner spark    to life the gas ignites the
tarantula is engulfed in    flame

gladys is knocked down by the blast she lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with a
webline gladys screams as shes dragged across the
floor toward the basement door

the fire grows more intense spreading quickly

the group can hear spiders bashing at the upstairs door

                           wade
                    to norman
             oh great! now youve trapped us!

chris moves to the bottom of the stairs

                           chris
             we should be able to hold them off
             for a little while

suddenly a loud banging erupts on the wall behind them

                           ashley
             theyre coming through the wall!

the group tightens up back to back ready for the end
suddenly a human hand punches through the wall

                              chris
             what the hell

                                                 continued

pointed right at him

                           bret

wade embraces his son

                           wade
             i thought you were a goner boy!

chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine

                           chris

                           ashley

                           mike
             not until daylight

the banging on the upper door gets more intense

norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
grow lights from his weed farm he passes them out to
the group

chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
mine shaft bret is shocked as the others follow him
the group uses the grow lights and flashlights

                           bret
             youre going back in there!       are
             you all crazy!

                            bret
             no way!   im not going!

bret is alone in the room as the upper door implodes and
spiders flood downstairs bret dives through the
opening

                                                     81

int mine tunnel  night

bret runs past sam and chris sam fires her shotgun at
the first spider that enters the tunnel her gun clicks
dry she unholsters her pistols and fires

                           chris
          cover me!

                        sam

chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnels upper
support beam more spiders come into the tunnel sam
fires desperately chris keeps on hacking

                           sam
          hurry!

sams guns click dry spiders charge chris swings the
machete hard the roof collapses onto the attacking
spiders

chris and sam leap back landing in a heap clouds of
dust swirl around them they are tangled up for an
awkward beat their faces just inches from each other

                        sam
          hold that thought

they manage to disengage and move on


int mine tunnel  night

chris and sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors

                        wade

                        chris

splinters chris and the others bash through they file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels the place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste

                        chris
          i dont believe it

mike recognizes the biohazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch

                        mike

             broke! they gave me a hundred
             grand!

sam punches him     knocking wade to the ground

                           sam
             i think our lives are worth a
             little more than that

                           chris
             were wasting time

chris heads toward the only exit available the others
follow wade staggers to his feet stumbling after
them


int mine tunnel  night

chris leads the group down a tunnel they come across
bits of vintage mining gear a string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels

                           chris
             one end of these lights should be
             connected to a generator thatll
             be near the entrance

they continue down the tunnel     entering

drained away

mike hides his eyes     ashley comforts him

                           sam

chris runs over and slices it open with his machete       the
web comes away to reveal a human hand

                           chris
             theres somebody in here!

they finally reveal gladys

                            chris

             her breathing is shallow       shes
             going into arrest

ashley proceeds with cpr just like she saw on tv
suddenly gladys snaps out of it gasping for air

                             chris

gladys starts to get a grip trying to focus on chris

cavern the group turns their lights on it the
reflection is dazzling veins of gold crisscross the
cavern walls

ashley smiles

gladys leans over to norman

                           gladys
             have you got a smoke kid

                           norman
             the man says this cavern is full
             of highly flammable methane gas

                           sam
             spiders!

the group sees a cluster of normalsized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows

                           norman
             whats the big deal

norman steps on the closest one grinding it under his
boot he stomps around crushing as many as he can
mike watches this curiously taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies

                           mike
             i think you should stop

                           norman
             why

                        mike

          fully grown tarantulas

chris and sam look over

                                                continued

                                                        87

continued

                           mike
             theyre giant babies!

norman freezes he hears something moving around in the
dark and then a spine chilling growl

chris reacts to the noise    he can guess whats coming

the female tarantula steps out of the shadows consuela
has grown to be as big as a volkswagen microbus by far
the largest spider weve seen yet covered in hair
massive eyes her two fangs are the size of machetes

mikes eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis

                           mike
             consuela

                           chris
             consuela

the fur on consuelas back seems to undulate there is
something weird there a lot of weird things in
fact her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas

as consuela advances she flicks several dartsized
quills off her belly right into norman a dark stain
spreads across the drug dealers shirt

                           norman
             bummer

consuela pierces norman with her fangs holding him
tight babies flood of her back and onto the doper
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas

                           chris
             go!

the group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern        a
male tarantula drops down to block their escape sam
blows it away wade and bret are still chipping away
bits of gold

                           chris
             leave it!

                           wade
             so you can keep it all!   hell no!

wade gets a nugget off the wall he only has a
nanosecond to admire it before consuela suddenly looms
behind him

                                               continued

                                                          88

continued

                              bret

bret reaches out toward his father wade reaches for
him consuelas fangs suddenly protrude from wades
chest and hes hauled backward the tarantula flings
wade into the cave

                              chris
             bret come on!

bret runs after the others but he sees consuela firing
more quills at the group directly at ashley bret
leaps into harms way hes turned into a pin cushion

                              ashley
             bret!

ashley goes to his side

                              bret
             im sorry i

int mines  night

the survivors flee along the tunnel chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling

                           sam
             we have to get out!

                           chris

chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand

                           chris
             when the power comes on the bulb
             will ignite the methane and torch

             the spiders as i can that should
             give us time to get clear

sam and chris share a brief beat and then chris pulls
down the lights dragging them back toward the
tarantulas den

flame shoots out behind them   ashley and mike are
nearby the town is visible just a mile away


ext town  day

the spiders retreat from daylight scuttling back into
the buildings heading down into the mine shafts


int various mine tunnels  day

the chain reaction spreads through the mines      jets of
flame blast up tunnels

torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home
rupturing the very earth around them


ext desert  near wades ranch  day

the earth begins to shake violently

                          ashley

                           gladys
             lets get the fuck out of here!

the survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
blow up in the distance

chris is just about to climb aboard when a webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft consuela lives!
the spider is charred and bloody but shes primed for
revenge

chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her            he
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline
cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
consuelas fangs

consuela knocks away chriss machete and lunges down at
him chris kicks her belly with both his feet consuela
begins to shudder jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace chris kicks and tears at the failing armor
he thinks hes harming the tarantula but hes actually
helping it!

mike and the others watch from the humvee

                           mike
             oh no shes molting!

consuelas blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!

consuela comes after chris        he defends himself with the
machete

shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs
once again consuela punts away the machete she prepares
the death blow it looks like curtains for chris

                               mike
             consuela!   no!     bad!   bad
             consuela!

the massive spider stops in shock            chris looks back to
see mike has returned


tarantula pov

the familiar multiperspective spider vision            the
tarantula seems to recognize mike

                                                       95

back to mike

he throws his cassiopeia pda at the spiders face

chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spiders unprotected
abdomen

the tarantula screams

chris leaps up and runs scooping up mike   they dive
into the back of the humvee

consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded she
collapses in the dust the town explodes in the bg
the earth itself begins to collapse


int humvee  driving across desert  day

gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance
buildings explode jets of flame burst upward the mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth the
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert


ext highway  day

the humvee reaches open road the survivors watch out
the back as prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole


ext highway/int humvee  moving  day

the group sits in a long beat of abject shock and then
chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped

                        chris
          i really need some pants that fit

the group smiles    happy to be alive

                          mike
          look out!

everyone looks to the road ahead a familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway gladys honks and swerves
to avoid it


ext highway  day

the bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety

the rabbit continues its trek for a moment and then is
grabbed by a large trapdoor spider

                                           fade out




                        the end
