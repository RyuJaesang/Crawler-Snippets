               marie taking it in fast bourne seems paralyzed trying to 
               soak it all in willing himself home touching things as he 
               passes as if a texture a smell  something will become 
               familiar hes deep into this as we go to 

               the bedroom

               marie in the doorway checking it out its so clean and 
               simple but its not the decor shes most interested in

               marie opening an armoire

               nothing but mens clothes no competition shes feeling 
               better by the moment as we go to 

               the kitchen

               like a stage set lots of props and no sign of food bourne 
               picking up a frying pan

                                     bourne
                         this is my frying pan
                              and then

                              from the doorway

                         go ahead

               marie backs out bourne alone again standing there for a 
               moment dealing with it

               and then he sits down in a chair

               bourne sitting there staring the room the desk  its 
               all so devoid of personality and then something catches 
               his eye and 

               insert  the desk top  a faint silhouette through the 
               dust and grime outlines of where a computer used to sit

               bourne reaching suddenly under the desk bingo pulling out 
               a retractable computer keyboard tray but its empty no 
               keyboard now hes really confused and 

               insert  a phone/answering machine  bourne pressing the 
               playback button and 

                                     phone machine
                         you have no messages

               bourne leaving that for a moment  about to anyway  and 
               then he turns back  new idea  pressing for the speaker 
               phone  and then hitting redial and 

               the phone stars dialing

               ringing and

                         these people im not sure i want to 
                         know ill take a guess theres some

                         modification going on here

               bourne almost recoils almost he doesnt know what to do 
               doesnt know how to react

               hotel marboeuf paris this is the place that answered the 
               phone when bourne hit redial in his apartment this is the 
               place that john michael kane was staying when he died

               and so begins the investigation

               now since the presence of danger  ie wombosis guys and/or 
               treadstone  is still up in the air and since this scene 
               could either play very quickly or very long and since were 
               not exactly sure where we stand with page count  this scene 
               is not finished

               the rules of the scene however seem to be thus bourne 
               would have to be very nervous about being recognized if he 
               was kane and kane stayed here hes not the guy to do whatever 
               social engineering needs doing

               long version bourne sets the table and marie gets the goods 
               somehow theres a threat from treadstone or wombosi

               fast version its all results  we see them execute a plan 
               rather than work it up marie is already in the hotel in a 
               hotel uniform posing as a guest in any case she looks 
               very much different than weve ever seen her before

               she gets close to the office hides waits bourne calls the 
               desk from a pay phone asks for something we see that some 
               sort of improvised boobytrap has been set inside the hotel 
               to start a fire in the confusion  marie  very bravely  
               gets into the office we do a quick cut outside to bourne

               bournes back  bare  two bullet scars  still raw

               the bomb  its all getting loud around him

                         why
                              this could get

                              now 
                         i learned many many things from the 
                         cia many things i learned the way 
                         they think
                              beat
                         was the bomb on my boat supposed to 
                         go off or not

               bourne distracted by the kids  these faces  its

                                     wombosi
                         you didnt set the bomb why

               bourne not sure  about any of it 

                                     wombosi
                         was this a game or a fuck up

                                     bourne
                         i dont know

                                     wombosi
                         get the kids out!

               he doesnt have to say it twice  they know the drill  
               theyre gone

                                     wombosi
                         and the door

               deauvage closing the doors and as he does 

               the professor attacks

                   

               this scene has not been written

               its a shootout

               the professor is infinitely more talented at this than the 
               bodyguards

               bourne needs to get out of there  without looking wimpy 

               no children are harmed

               as the professor rallies  he will shoot wombosi  he will 
               find bournes jacket left on the floor in which later he 
               will find a clue leading him to belleville and last but 
               hardly least he will take a parting shot at the bomb still 
               sitting there on the throne

               there will be a huge trailerworthy explosion

               this might not want to be very long there is an extensive 
               action sequence just around the corner

               so bourne escapes physically hes just weary emotionally 
               hes fucked

               all of that happens and we cut to

               staircase and  they fly down the steps  landing on 

               the metro platform

               the professor lands on the other side  both racing down 
               the platform  professor tearing up the wall behind them 
               and  here comes a train  on bourne and maries side  
               travelling the opposite way  temporary refuge not for 
               long  theres no way out on this end of the platform they 
               skid to a halt  just as the train doors open  startled 
               straphangers stare at bourne and marie as they stop onto the 
               platform  take off running

               the professor has to turn his bike around hes quick  but 
               it gives bourne and marie a two second head start

               bourne and marie almost at the other end of the platform  
               gunfire ripping up the windows behind them gonna go for the 
               steps  but here come 

               the angry cops  remember them  the ones who took the 
               ride down the steps  theyre firing now and 

               bourne and marie turn back  the professor is firing and 
               there is only one option 

               int metro car  day

               bourne and marie into the conductor booth people diving off 
               the train as bourne hits the yellow button and  the train 
               starts rolling  doors still open  they disappear into 
               the protection of the tunnel walls  then bourne hits the 
               button to close the doors and  the professor  watching 
               the trains accelerate out of the station  and now hes 
               racing his bike down the platform  opposite the motion of 
               the train and  here comes the end of the train and the 
               professor throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off 
               the platform all in one move  landing hard on the tracks 
               but facing the right direction and now hes accelerating 
               towards the train  just as an oncoming train is racing 
               into the station and  he leaps onto the back of the train 
               in the nick of time his gun clatters to the tracks

               in the last metro car

               the window is shattered and the professor lets himself in  
               wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows  
               and 

               in the first metro car

               bourne and marie finally getting a breather bourne keeps 
               looking back  nothing  the train is deserted finally 

                                     marie
                         xxxxxx

                                     bourne

                         xxxxxx

               and ahead  daylight  the train tracks go above ground 
               and as the train hits daylight  we see the professor 
               directly behind bourne on the other side of the glass and 

               crash! the professor grabs bourne through the glass ramming 
               his head into the metal as 

               bourne grabs the knob swings the door open and crushes the 
               professor  crushes him again and now he is free and 

               bourne turns pulls up the shotgun and  the professor kicks 
               it out of his hands  it clatters to the ground and now we 
               have a beat  the train car races across the bir hakeim 
               bridge  all of paris laid out behind them bourne and the 
               professor squaring off  both looking at the gun  realizing 
               theres no chance for either one of them to get it and 

               a brutal ruthless fight breaks out bournes motivated  
               the professors crazy  makes it a pretty even match looks 
               like it could go on for a little while when suddenly 

               bam!!! the professor drops to the ground  behind him  
               marie wields the shot gun

                                     marie

                         xxxxxx

               and bourne takes the gun from her  standing there  
               reloading  both barrels  raising the gun  aiming it
