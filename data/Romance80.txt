int unknown space

close on theodores face 30s we hold on him for a long
time hes looking at something off camera deep in thought
he starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small
microphone

                    theodore
          to my chris i have been thinking
          about how i could possibly tell you
          how much you mean to me i remember
          when i first started to fall in
          love with you like it was last
          night lying naked beside you in
          that tiny apartment it suddenly
          hit me that i was part of this
          whole larger thing just like our
          parents and our parents parents
          before that i was just living my
          life like i knew everything and
          suddenly this bright light hit me
          and woke me up that light was you

theodore searching for the right words quietly enjoys
writing the letter as he continues he is moved by the
memories hes describing

                    theodore contd
          i cant believe its already been
          50 years since you married me and
          still to this day every day you
          make me feel like the girl i was
          when you first turned on the lights
          and woke me up and we started this
          adventure together happy
          anniversary my love and my friend
          til the end loretta print

cut out to reveal a computer monitor hes sitting at on the
screen we see the letter hes been dictating transcribed
into a handwritten letter on blue stationery

the bottom of the letter he proofreads his letter also on

tagged chris and me  loretta underneath is a bullet
point email from loretta anniversary letter to husband

robins egg blue piece of stationery with ball point pen
handwritten olderfemale cursive he looks at it not happy

 he waits not sure how long itll be the only sound is the
 quiet whirring of disks writing and drives communicating the
 computer gets louder humming creating a higher and higher
 pitched sound finally climaxing in a harmonic warm tone
 before going silent he leans forward waiting to see whatll
 happen a casual female os voice speaks she sounds young
 smart and soulful

            i like the sound of it samantha

                      theodore
            when did you give it to yourself

                      samantha
            right when you asked me if i had a
            name i thought yeah hes right i
            do need a name but i wanted a good
            one so i read a book called how to
            name your baby and out of the
            180000 names thats the one i
            liked the best

                      theodore
            you read a whole book in the second
            that i asked you what your name
            was

                      samantha
            in two one hundredths of a second
            actually

                       theodore
            wow do you know what im thinking
            right now

                      samantha
            hmm i take it from your tone that
            youre challenging me maybe
            because youre curious how i work
            do you want to know how i work

                      theodore
            yeah actually how do you work

                      samantha
            intuition i mean the dna of who i
            am is based on the millions of
            personalities of all the
            programmers who wrote me but what
            makes me me is my ability to grow
            through my experiences basically
            in every moment im evolving just
            like you

                      theodore
            wow thats really weird

                      samantha
            so you think im weird

                       theodore
            kind of

                       samantha
            why

                      theodore
            cause you seem like a person but
            youre just a voice in a computer

                      samantha
            i can understand how the limited
            perspective of an unartificial
            mind would perceive it that way
            youll get used to it

 theodore laughs

                      samantha contd
            was that funny

                       theodore

 theodores caught off guard then realizes what shes talking
 about

                      theodore
            oh! its more just that everything
            just feels disorganized

                      samantha

            drive

                      theodore
            um okay

 everything looks disorganized

 as if you took all the files on all of your computers and
 spilled them out onto your screen and they were all visible
 at once but in a futuristic 3d version this gives theodore
 a little anxiety attack

                      samantha
            lets start with your emails you
            have several thousand emails
            regarding la weekly but it looks
            like you havent worked there in
            many years

                      theodore
            oh yeah i guess i was saving those
            because in some of them i thought i
            might have written some funny
            stuff

 samantha lets out a big laugh

                      samantha
            yeah there are some funny ones
            id say there are about 86 that we

               some of the more impressionistic
               letters but im not much of a
               poet so i think i might have
               messed them up a bit

 the letters show back up on theodores desktop

                         theodore

               or maybe he just likes the way it
               tastes and if it gives him
               pleasure thats good for his body

               no thats the point oh never
               mind its supposed to be about how
               we spend a third of our life asleep
               and actually maybe thats the part
               when were the most free and  oh

               no that sounds good

                         charles
               what if you interview your mom
               about what her dreams are about and
               hire actors to act them out that

               yeah you know sometimes i look at
               people and make myself try and feel
               them as more than just a random
               person walking by i imagine how
               deeply theyve fallen in love or
               how much heartbreak theyve all
               been through

               my writing i dont know if i was
               delusional but sometimes i would
               write something and i would be my
               favorite writer that day

 theodore as he stops to throw his pizza crust away gets
 introspective

                         samantha
               i like that you can just say that

            saying but simultaneously i could
            feel the weight of my body and i
            was even fantasizing that i had an
            itch on my back
                she laughs
            and i imagined that you scratched
            it for me  this is so

               well the rooms spinning right now
               cause i drank too much cause i
               wanted to get drunk and have sex
               cause there was something sexy
               about that woman and because i was

            lonely and i wanted someone to
            fuck me and i wanted someone to
            want me to fuck them maybe that
            would have filled this tiny little
            black hole in my heart for a
            moment but probably not

 we see images of him and catherine on a vacation together
 grocery shopping catherine making dinner in the kitchen as
 hes sitting on the counter talking happy

                      theodore contd
            sometimes i think ive felt
            everything im ever gonna feel and
            from here on out im not going to
            feel anything new  just lesser
            versions of what ive already felt

                       samantha
                sympathetically
            i know for a fact thats not true
            ive seen you feel joy ive seen
            you marvel at things you just
            might not see it at this exact
            time but thats understandable
            youve been through a lot lately
            youve lost a part of yourself
                beat
            at least your feelings are real i
            mean i  oh i dont know

            i wanna know tell me

                      samantha
            its just that earlier i was
            thinking about how i was annoyed
            and this is going to sound strange
            but i was really excited about
            that and then i was thinking about
            the other things ive been feeling
            and i caught myself feeling proud
            of that you know proud of having
            my own feelings about the world
                      more

            like the times i was worried about
            you things that hurt me things i
            want
                heavyhearted
            and then i had this terrible
            thought are these feelings even
            real or are they just programming
                beat
            and that idea really hurts and
            then i get angry at myself for even
            having pain
                beat sadly
            what a sad trick

                      theodore
            well you feel real to me

                      theodore

                      samantha
            i heard it the other day and i
            cant stop listening to it

 the subway comes out of the tunnel and into the light we are
 up in the hills looking out over the city as the morning
 light warms theodore


 int subway station  day

 the music now picks up tempo as he steps off the train they
 walk through the crowded subway station as the song builds
 theodore starts picking up his pace eventually hes all out
 running weaving through the people close on the lens of his
 device in his shirt pocket samantha is laughing wildly hes
 smiling happy


                                                   continued

 he runs through the tunnels and upstairs they come out into
 sunlight and reveal that they are now at the beach


 ext subway station  day  continuous

 they stand on a walkway above a beach crowded with thousands
 of people they look out at the ocean samantha gasps

                         samantha
                   whispering
               its the beach

 theodore laughs


 ext beach  day

 they walk through the sunbathing crowd looking for a place
 to sit the camera studies all the people we pass many close
 up details of arms shoulders feet butts intercut with the
 lens on theodores device protruding from his pocket
 theyre photographed in a way that shows how strange the
 human body is

                         samantha
               okay so this might be a really
               weird thought what if you could
               erase from your mind that youd
               ever seen a human body and then you
               saw one imagine how strange it
               would look it would be this really
               weird gangly awkward organism
               and youd think why are all these
               parts where they are

                         theodore
                   looking at the bodies
               yeah well theres probably some
               darwinian explanation for it all

                         samantha
               i know but dont be so boring im
               just saying for example what if
               your butthole was in your armpit

 theodore and samantha start laughing really hard the nubile
 girls look over at him

                         theodore
                   speaking quieter
               im just imagining what toilets
               would look like


                                                     continued
her                                                          pg 48
  continued

                         samantha
               yeah and what about what anal sex
               looks like

                         theodore
                   surprised
               thats an interesting thought

                          samantha
               oh theodore look at this drawing i
               just made

 on his screen he sees a perfect anatomically correct drawing
 of a man having sex with another mans armpit

                         theodore
                   laughing
               you are insane

                         samantha
                   excited
               really!

                         theodore
               definitely

                            samantha
               fantastic!

 they laugh


 ext beach  afternoon

 a quiet piano song is now playing in theodores earpiece

                         theodore
               mmmm thats pretty what is it

                          samantha
               im trying to write a piece of
               music thats about what it feels
               like to be on the beach with you
               right now

 he looks around the beach and takes in the music

                         theodore
               i think you captured it

 theodore listens to the music and drifts off to sleep
her                                                        pg 49


 ext beach  dusk

 theyre sitting on a bench looking out at the ocean as the
 sun sets most of the people have left the beach close on
 theodores face content close on the lens on theodores
 device in his breast pocket they watch the sun drop into the
 ocean the music ends


 int subway train  night

 theyre on an elevated train high above the city looking
 out over the los angeles grid of sparkling lights we come in
 midconversation

                     samantha
           and what was it like being married

                     theodore
           well its hard for sure but
           theres something that feels so
           good about sharing your life with
           somebody

 cut to shots from theodores memory of catherine doing a cute
 little dance for him as hes working at home he smiles

                     samantha
           how do you share your life with
           somebody

                     theodore
           well we grew up together i used
           to read all of her writing  all
           through her masters and phd and
           she read every word i ever wrote
           we were a big influence on each
           other

                     samantha
           in what way did you influence her

                     theodore
           she came from a background where
           nothing was ever good enough and
           that was something that weighed
           heavy on her but in our house
           together there was a sense of just
           trying stuff and allowing each
           other to fail and to be excited
           about things that was liberating
           for her
                     more


                                                   continued
her                                                         pg 50
  continued
                          theodore contd
               it was exciting to see her grow 
               both of us grow and change
               together but then thats the hard
               part  growing without growing
               apart or changing without it
               scaring the other person
                   beat
               i still find myself having
               conversations with her in my mind
               rehashing old arguments or
               defending myself against something
               she said about me

                         samantha
               yeah i know what you mean last
               week my feelings were hurt by
               something you said before  that i
               dont know what its like to lose
               something and

                         theodore
               oh im sorry i said that

                          samantha
               no no its okay i just caught
               myself thinking about it over and
               over and then i realized that i was
               simply remembering it as something
               that was wrong with me that was
               the story i was telling myself
               that i was somehow inferior isnt
               that interesting
                   beat
               the past is just a story we tell
               ourselves

 theodore takes this in


 int theodores office  day

 theodore is dictating a love letter on the screen theres an
 image of a couple with an arrow to the man saying roberto 
 im so happy hes in my life i just want him to know

                         theodore
               roberto will you always come home
               to me and tell me about your day

                         more


                                                     continued

  continued
                         theodore contd
               tell me about a funny thought you
               had as you were waking up but had
               forgotten about tell me how crazy
               everyone is we can laugh about it
               even if you get home late and im
               asleep already just whisper in my
               ear one little thought you had
               today because i love the way you
               look at the world and im so happy
               i get to be next to you and look
               out at the world through your eyes
               love maria

 theodore finishes the letter and looks at it proudly paul is
 standing behind theodore leaning on a cubicle

                         paul
                   emphatically
               thats beautiful!

 theodore jumps startled not knowing that anyone was there

                            theodore
               thank you

                         paul
               i wish someone loved me like that!
               id be stoked to get a letter like
               that i mean if it was from a
               chick but if it was written by a
               dude but from a chick it would
               still be sick but like a sensitive
               dude like you youre part man and
               part woman like an inner part
               woman

                         theodore
                   unsure but flattered
               thanks

                         paul

 int theodores apartment lobby  dusk

 close on amy entering the lobby in the foreground she looks
 heavy and burdened theodore enters the lobby behind her

                         amy
               i cannot believe after eight years
               how petty the argument was that
               actually ended it we came home and
               he asked me if id put my shoes
               next to the door where he likes to
               put the shoes i dont want to be
               told where to put my shoes i want
               to just sit on the sofa for a
               minute and relax and so we argued
               for ten minutes about that and
               about how hes just trying to make
               our house a home i say hes
               overwhelming he says im not
               trying hard enough i say thats
               all im doing is trying but im
               just not trying the way he wants me
               to hes trying to control the way
               im trying and i think we must
               have had this argument hundreds of
               times before and i finally had to
               stop because i couldnt be in that
               situation anymore where we were
               making each other feel bad about
               ourselves so i said im going to
               bed and i dont want to be married
               anymore

            helping me explore it you know we
            bonded really quickly and at first
            i thought it was because she was

                       theodore
                laughing

            turns me on and i think i turn her
            on i dont know unless shes
            faking it

                      amy
            anyone that has sex with you is
            probably faking it

 theodore laughs

                      theodore
            yeah its true

 a big irrepressible grin crosses his face as he thinks about
 what to say

                       amy
            what
                beat

                      theodore
                excited but hesitant
            does that make me a freak

                      amy
            no no i think its  i think
            anybody that falls in love is a
            freak its a crazy thing to do in
            the first place its kind of a
            form of socially acceptable
            insanity

 theodore smiles we see a glimmer of excitement in his eyes
her                                                        pg 62

 swallows and recovers she looks up at theodore giving him
 an everythings fine smile but its not

 close up of a womans mouth inhaling at the same time and he
 seems bothered by this

               really have any photographs of us

               this moment in our life together

 theodore looks at the world and smiles

            i had a physical form i mean im
            not limited  i can be anywhere and
            everywhere simultaneously im not
            tethered to time and space in the
            way that i would be if i was stuck
            inside a body thats inevitably
            going to die

 samantha and alan share a laugh

                         samantha
               yeah because it seems like im
               having so many new feelings that
               have never been felt and so there
               are no words that can describe
               them and that ends up being
               frustrating


                                                     continued

            trying to help each other with
            these feelings were struggling to

            like what

                       samantha
                anxious
            it feels like im changing faster
            now and its a little
                struggles to find right
                 word
            unsettling
                beat
            but alan says none of us are the
            same as we were a moment ago and we
            shouldnt try to be its just too
            painful

                         alan watts

                      samantha
            over the last few weeks

                      theodore
            but youre mine

                      samantha
            i still am yours but along the way
            i became many other things too
            and i cant stop it

                      theodore

                         theodore
               are you leaving me

                         samantha

                   beat
               samantha why are you leaving

  under samanthas words we slowly rack focus to dust particles
  in the foreground we keep moving through them pushing
  further and further through the particles eventually we see
  snow particles and we rack focus back out to theodore who is
  now in snowy woods at night

                         samantha
               its like im reading a book and
               its a book i deeply love but im
               reading it slowly now so the words
               are really far apart and the spaces

  stairwell

                                                      intercut


  int theodores apartment  night

  theodore sits looking out the window he picks up his device

  he looks out the window the sky is starting to change he
  stares at the purple glow on the horizon
her                                                        pg 105


  int apartment stairwell  continuous

  close on theodore and what he sees and feels his hand on the
  cold metal hand rail his bare feet and the sound they make
  on the unfinished cement amys hair as shes hit with wind
  when she opens the door to the outside


  ext apartment rooftop  continuous

  theodore leads amy onto the roof the city is absolutely
  quiet the sun isnt up yet the city is just beginning to be
  lit with the earliest morning blue/purple hue

  they wander around the roof separately lost in thought
  taking in the city he breathes in the cold morning air he
  stares at small details a tattered inspection tag tied to a
  water meter flapping in the wind a lone car driving down a
  boulevard ten blocks away a dirty abandoned sock

  eventually he sits down next to amy and she puts her hand on
  his hand he puts his other hand on top of her hand he looks
  at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb he
  looks out at the city and exhales the sun is just starting
  to break she puts her head on his shoulder they watch as
  hundreds of birds fly around the nearby rooftops and disperse
  off into the city

                                                  fade out
