               int tribeca loft  day

               the camera tracks slowly through clouds of moving dust shafts 
               of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere an eerie 
               netherworld envelops us strange ghostly forms appear and 
               disappear in the distance they seem like apparitions

               broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky 
               light we see hints of a huge demolished space

               an old white plaster wall fills the screen momentary blips 
               of light flash across it sounds of street traffic are heard 
               dimly in the distance

               with startling impact the sound of a sledgehammer explodes 
               out of nowhere the wall shudders

               hammer blows assault the audience they are loud and jarring 
               the wall buckles

               chunks of plaster crash to the floor the air fills with new 
               swirls of white dust the sledgehammer smashes into view 
               beams of sunlight cut through the cracks piercing the 
               atmosphere like searchlights in a fog a huge section of 
               wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the 
               air we hear voices talking

                                     molly os
                         what a mess!

                         i told you!

               through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on 
               the other side of the wall all wielding sledgehammers

                                     sam
                         i cant breathe

                         use your mask dummy

               one of the figures adjusts something over his face isolated 
               rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in 
               the air

                                     sam
                              singing
                         volga boat man whoomph!

               his hammer pounds the wall molly laughs

               angle

               the camera moves in and for the first time we see them molly 
               jensen in her late 20s has a bandanna around her hair and 
               a workmans mask over her nose but we can tell from her 
               eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful sam wheat in his 
               late 30s is also hidden behind a mask but he has a strong 
               forehead and handsome features sweat is dripping down his 
               brow leaving streaks in the dust carl bruner early 30s 
               removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a 
               fashionable twoday stubble both men have their shirts off

                                                                    cut to

               blackness and a loud thud suddenly a shaft of light 
               penetrates the darkness another thud and more light we see 
               a hole the hook of a crowbar enters it grappling with 
               something around the edges then with a tug and a loud yank 
               a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor huge 
               clouds of dust fly into the air molly looks up astonished

                                     molly

                         could add a second floor and put our 
                         bedroom upstairs that would leave 
                         all this space

                                     sam

               carl laughs as he looks at sam their bodies covered with 
               white powder appear as strange ghostly figures

                                     carl
                         sam this may be none of my business

               sam obeys molly doodles on his chest drawing a bow tie and 
               the outline of a tuxedo jacket her lines are quick 
               accomplished and subtly erotic

                                     carl

               molly nods she reaches out and superimposes an armless female 
               torso over his his stomach jumps sensually as she touches 
               it molly pulls back to admire her work he looks like a 
               greek statue

               begins to count

                         all together now one
                              they strike the wall 
                              with their hammers 
                              the wall shakes
                         two
                              they pound again 
                              the wall begins to 
                              give
                         three

               in unison they hit it once more a massive section of plaster 
               and metal topples to the ground new clouds of dust fill the 
               air suddenly sam spies an old jar lying on the floor 
               something rattles inside it a penny

                                     sam

               she glances at him lovingly carl looks at the two of them 
               and grins

               as the dust settles we see for the first time the outlines 
               of the space they are working in it is a huge loft over 
               four thousand square feet banks of windows run east and

               he hangs up and stares at the japanese men a short smile 
               crosses his face

                                                                    cut to

               a carved wooden angel

               eight feet tall ascending into an afternoon sky as the 
               camera pulls back we see that we are inside a building and 
               that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above 
               the street

               a group of workmen grab for the angel but have difficulty 
               bringing it in suddenly molly steps into the frame

                                     molly
                         where you guys from the new york 
                         city ballet

               with a gutsy maneuver molly leans out over the sidewalk and 
               tries to grab hold of the ropes she cant reach them 
               suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist she 
               screams

                                     sam

               sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft she does not 
               think it is funny

                                     molly

                         better than seeing this gorgeous 
                         body splattered all over the street 
                         here look out

               sam jumps up grabs hold of the doors top molding and swings 
               out over the sidewalk molly gasps sams feet push at the 
               angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the 
               loft quickly he jumps back grabs hold of it and brings it 
               in the workmen applaud molly eyes him with admiration

               suddenly we hear a voice call out

               sam stops and stares at molly he pauses quietly he is about 
               to speak when a mans face emerges from the shadows behind 
               him molly gasps sam spins around

               an intense looking man

               is standing in the darkness between two buildings he stares 
               at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk 
               sam and molly stand motionless the man hesitates and then 
               begins walking the other way molly exhales a deep breath

               sam takes mollys arm and they continue briskly down the 
               street suddenly they hear footsteps coming after them

                                     molly
                         what should we do

                                     sam

               sam stops abruptly and turns around a gun is staring him in 
               the face molly screams

                                     willie

                         give it to him!

               sam reaches for his jacket the mugger grabs his wrist and 
               then carefully pulls the wallet out himself

                                     sam
                         take the money just leave the wallet 
                         and my

               he swipes sam across the head molly screams the mugger 
               whacks her across the face sam explodes plowing into the 
               mugger with all his might

                                     molly
                         sam no!

               there is a wild all out brawl sam fights like a mad man 
               suddenly the gun goes off the mugger panics and takes off 
               running sam charges after him

                                     molly

               the two men run down the dark street but the mugger is 
               already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows

               sam gives up slowly he turns and begins walking back toward 
               molly

               we can see molly dimly at the end of the block as sam 
               approaches she is screaming for help frightened sam calls 
               out

                                     sam

               she doesnt answer sam tenses and starts running toward 
               her he is just three feet away when suddenly he stops an 
               expression of pure terror overwhelms his face

                                                                    cut to

               drenched in blood her eyes are glazed on the verge of shock 
               panting she stoops down to the curb as the camera travels 
               with her she grabs hold of something lying in the shadows 
               and pulls it toward her

               it is sams dead body she is holding in her arms

               sams ghostly form still solid to all appearances stands 
               beside molly his eyes are awash in horror and confusion he 
               seems unable to move the camera holds on his face as the 
               full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes

               suddenly he lets out a bloodcurdling scream

                                     sam
                         no!!!!!!

               he jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold 
               of his motionless form his hands make a strange sound as 
               they pass right though it it is terrifying sam jumps up 
               crazed frenzied and begins circling molly it is as though 
               he is trying to undo what has been done

                                     sam
                              continuing

               shoulder he screams

               footsteps people are running down the street the sound of 
               sirens can be heard in the distance two men run toward sam 
               he yells out at them

                                     sam
                              continuing
                         help me!

               they run right through him he gasps in stunned terror

               sam watches helplessly as they reach his body molly looks 
               up and begins screaming hysterically one of the men grabs 
               her as the other goes for sams wrist there is no sign of 
               life

               the first man holds molly back as his friend stoops down and 
               begins some form of cardiopulmonary resuscitation there is 
               no response sam bends down trying desperately to help it 
               is a futile gesture

                                     sam
                         do it! do it!

               the man bangs on sams chest blood gushes from the wound 
               molly recoils he bangs again

               night light molly is lying beside him her head buried 
               beneath a pillow sam seems stunned

                                     sam

                         molly!

               sam is so relieved to hear her voice that he can hardly 
               breathe

                                     molly

               molly groggy tries to sit up sam reaches out for her

               as she turns around we see a skeletel version of her head 
               staring at the camera it speaks

                                     molly
                              mocking him
                         what is it honey

               sam bolts upright screaming it is a scream so consumed by 
               terror that one fears it will never stop

                                                       cut unexpectedly to

               closeup of sam

               asleep in bed he is thrashing at his pillow and moaning

               suddenly a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder sam 
               jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets

                                                                    cut to

               molly is sitting on the bed looking at him afraid

               sam stares down at her he is breathing heavily not trusting 
               his own senses his hands clutch at the wall

                                     sam

               angle

               suddenly a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a 
               host of glowing forms radiating an intense inner light 
               float before us a blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite 
               vortex behind them sam is awed and confused we sense that 
               the light is enchanting him the entire room begins to 
               disappear in the light

               molly screams

                                     molly

               sam turns and sees molly only she is not in the bed she is 
               back on the street to his amazement he is on the street 
               too still bathed in the soothing light frightened he calls 
               out to her

                                     sam

                              continuing
                         molly

               there is no response sam deeply troubled hesitates for a 
               moment he is torn between molly and the light then in a 
               painful but conscious gesture he turns from the light and 
               walks toward molly at that instant the light behind him 
               disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing there 
               is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates 
               into the void sam is left on the dark pavement he stands 
               there a moment as if in shock and then begins running toward 
               molly an ambulance is rounding the corner

                                                                    cut to

               swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights 
               and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush the siren 
               wails into the night

               int ambulance  night

               sams body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a 
               paramedic applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort 
               to save him after a moment he looks up at molly we can 
               tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless 
               sam yells

                                     sam
                         dont stop! im not dead!

               molly kneeling over sams body grabs him and begins to cry 
               in long terrible sobs

               int hospital emergency room  night

               a doctor comforting molly accompanies her from one of the 
               emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of 
               swinging doors into a separate waiting area we see two 
               policemen and two detectives stand up and approach her

               sam doesnt want molly to go and begins to follow her but 
               then seems torn afraid to leave his body he turns back 
               just as his corpse covered in a green sheet is wheeled 
               into the corridor and parked alongside the wall sam seems 
               stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it

               a wrinkled old man approaches sam and joins him on the bench 
               he begins talking

                                     man
                         so what happened to you

                         4c cardiac wing shes fighting it

               the man sticks his head into the green sheet covering sams 
               body his head disappears sam is terrified

                                     man

                         youll catch on

               suddenly there is a loud commotion and we see several 
               physicians operating furiously on an old man lying on the 
               table beside them it is a life threatening situation and 
               they seem to be failing

                                     man

                         know

               angle

               before sam can understand what is happening the entire room 
               fills with a strange preternatural light suddenly he looks 
               up and freezes

               the amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating 
               down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the 
               operating table they are emitting a powerful light

                                     doctor
                         hurry were losing him

                         whatd i tell you bingo!

               the glowing forms take hold of the mans spirit and help 
               extract it from his body his physical form changes instantly 
               from a solid object into an ethereal substance

               sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit 
               upward they evaporate through the ceiling

                                     doctor
                         hes gone

               angle

               the light in the room grows dull instantly nurses cover the 
               dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away sam 
               turns to the old man

                                     sam
                         who are you whats happening

               the man isnt there an orderly approaches the gurney with 
               sams body and begins pushing it toward the elevator sam 
               jumps in front of him

                                     sam
                              continuing
                         no!

                                                                    cut to

               sams pov

               as the stretcher begins to roll right through him the 
               penetration of his physical space is horrifying to sam he 
               stands almost paralyzed as the body of the orderly 
               intersects with his it is a stunning moment of extraordinary 
               strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the 
               orderlys body passing through his it is like a glimpse of 
               ultimate chaos the universe within

               then in a flash the orderly has passed through but sam is 
               still shaking he stares up at the ceiling

                                     sam
                         oh god help me

                                                                    cut to

               as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur 
               the hallway grows dark it is as though sam is blacking out

               ext cemetery  day

               slowly images begin to emerge out of the blackness it takes 
               a moment to realize that they are scenes from sams funeral

               the camera tracks along rows of mourners as seen from sams 
               pov he seems to be floating among them we hear snippets 
               of conversations it all seems strangely odd and disjointed 
               time seems unfixed malleable

               we see a minister standing beside the grave

                                     minister
                         as we say farewell to our friend sam 
                         wheat we are reminded of his 
                         kindness his generosity his buoyancy 
                         of spirit

               the camera keeps moving sams associates from the bank are 
               among the mourners

                                     minister
                              continuing
                         all that we treasure our friends 
                         our loved ones our body our mind 
                         are but on loan to us we must 
                         surrender them all we are all 
                         travelers on the same road which 
                         leads to the same end

               sam notices a woman in a fancy print dress comforting one of 
               the mourners the woman looks up at him smiles and waves 
               sam is surprised he looks behind him but no one is there

               as he turns back the woman is walking away she appears 
               just like any normal person until she approaches a large 
               gravestone and passes right through it sam is shocked

                                     minister
                         as our loved one enters eternal life 
                         let us remember that love too is 
                         eternal that although we will miss 
                         him our love will light the void 
                         and dispel the darkness

               suddenly molly enters the frame sam spots her the camera 
               stops

                                     sam

               tears form in mollys eyes a hand reaches out to give her a 
               tissue molly looks up it is carl she gives him her hand 
               he squeezes it with affection

               shovel is placed in her hands with great emotional effort 
               she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket 
               it lands with a reverberating finality sam shudders

               he stands there staring at his own casket grieving then 
               after a moment he turns away separating from his body

               molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft 
               surrounded by friends and well wishers a young girl her 
               niece cuddles in her lap people are eating and milling 
               around slowly the camera begins to pan it ends on sam 
               standing alone in a corner in the midst of all the activity 
               he is lost and alone

                                                             fade to black

               raw clay on a potters wheel spins hypnotically sensuously 
               mollys wet hands press in shaping it molding it a bowl 
               begins to appear the camera pulls back and reveals sam he 
               is sitting on the floor behind her knees pressed to his 
               chest rocking aimlessly

               molly looks away from the bowl she is forming it distorts 
               and bends angry she digs her finger into it the bowl 
               disintegrates tears form in her eyes

               frank jumps up on the bench beside her molly stares sadly 
               around the room quietly she begins talking to herself to 
               the air

                                     molly
                         oh god sam

               sam looks up

                                     molly
                              continuing

                         i dont know why mr reynolds said 
                         to tell you hello i broke into tears 
                         its so hard

               sam walks over to molly desperate for contact he reaches 
               out to touch her cheek but then hesitates and pulls back

                                     molly
                              continuing
                         i think about you every minute its 
                         like youre still here like i can 
                         feel you sam

               he stares at her hoping wondering

                                     sam

               suddenly as if hearing sams voice the cat begins to hiss 
               molly spins around the cat scans the room unexpectedly 
               sams and the cats eyes meet with a wild screech the 
               cat jumps from the bench and takes off running sam recoils 
               molly stands up

                                     molly
                         frank whats wrong frank

               the cat is nowhere to be seen all of a sudden molly freezes 
               sam is standing right beside her it is almost as though she 
               senses his presence

                                     molly
                              continuing whispering
                         sam

               she holds very still for a moment sam watches breathlessly 
               loving her wanting her then quietly hopefully he reaches 
               out it is a useless gesture in a moment of great poignancy 
               molly shakes her head and walks right through him he remains 
               in the frame alone

               int bedroom  day

               sam stands in the corner of a large walkin closet watching 
               as molly goes through his effects boxes scattered underfoot 
               are filling up with his lifes possessions molly reaches 
               for a shirt

                                     sam
                         wait moll not that one thats my 
                         favorite

               she tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater it 
               is obviously handmade about four sizes too big sam 
               recognizes it

               molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek 
               after a moment she puts it back then in a surprising 
               outburst she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves 
               everything comes flying off sam reaches out to console her

                                     sam
                              continuing
                         molly dont

               unexpectedly carl comes rushing into the room he takes 
               hold of molly and sits her on the bed

                                     sam
                              continuing

               molly and carl are standing over the kitchen table folding 
               piles of sams clothes and placing them into boxes as molly 
               lifts one of sams jackets something falls from a side 
               pocket it is his small black leather address book sam stares 
               at it with recognition carl sees the book fall and stoops 
               to pick it up but molly gets it first

                                     molly
                         sams address book

               she skims through it a moment but the memories it evokes 
               are too powerful for her she places it carefully into a box 
               labeled sams things  valuable and continues packing 
               she finds the old jar with the penny in it its marked for 
               luck she holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it 
               on the nightstand beside the bed

               carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of sams 
               jackets he examines them

               she takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box sam 
               groans

               carl finds a half used package of rolaids molly takes them 
               from his hand and puts them in the box too

                                     carl

               she hurries over and pulls the valuable box from the stack

                              continuing

                         i cant do it carl

               carl annoyed walks over to her

                         molly youre not the one who died!

               molly stops and looks at him he has struck home after a 
               moment she nods her head

                                     molly
                         okay just a short walk

               he gently squeezes her shoulders

                         thata girl

               before sam even understands what is happening they are 
               exiting the loft sam jumps up and runs after them

                                     sam
                         hey molly! wait!

               angle

               the door slams shut sam is locked inside frightened and 
               desperate he rushes for the door knob his hand sinks through 
               it there is a strange sound like electrical static as it 
               penetrates the metal and wood frightened he yanks it back

               sam circles the space several times and then returns to the 
               door clenching his teeth he reaches out again as his hand 
               pushes up against it we sense that he experiences a subtle 
               resistance the hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his 
               ghostly form presses into it we sense sams fear as his 
               entire arm disappears from view the grating electrical sound 
               shudders up his spine

               the sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but sam does 
               not pull back slowly he edges in and presses his face into 
               the molecules of the wood

                                                                    cut to

               as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed 
               there is a sense of a universe in total chaos terrifying 
               sounds charge through his body

                                                                    cut to

               pulling back from the door he is trembling

               int loft  an hour later

               the camera moves slowly through the loft and gradually

               behind oda mae the moment feels rehearsed theatrical oda 
               mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes there 
               is a hush in the room her body begins to tremble mrs 
               santiago clutches her chair suddenly oda mae breaks out of

                         way to go milk her for every penny

               oda mae jumps up and stares at her sisters they look back 
               at her curiously they cant figure out whats wrong neither 
               can oda mae

               mrs santiago reaches into her purse a twenty dollar bill 
               changes hands sam watches amazed at it all oda mae sits 
               down and goes back into her trance her eyeballs roll up 
               into their sockets

                                     clara/louise
                         praise the lord thank you jesus

               oda mae is beginning to shake again the two women grab her 
               shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair suddenly 
               her whole body stiffens

                                     clara/louise
                              continuing
                         have mercy! have mercy!

               mrs santiago stares on in amazement after a moment oda 
               maes body collapses in a heap then like a phoenix rising 
               from the ashes she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes 
               a normal pose

               after several seconds to get her bearings oda mae begins to 
               speak only now she has an entirely new voice it sounds 
               deep and hoarse like an old mans for all its put on 
               theatricality it is strangely convincing

                                     oda mae

               afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed she 
               seems deeply depressed and alone gradually her gaze falls 
               on a jar sitting on the nightstand in it is the penny sam 
               found when they were first working on the loft a label on 
               the jar says for luck! in a moment of sudden rage she 
               picks it up and throws it against the wall it shatters on

                         just think about sam think about 
                         what he meant to you the years you 
                         had together how wonderful they 
                         were

               carl glides his hand slowly lovingly across her cheek

                              continuing
                         let your feelings out

               almost imperceptibly his hand moves down to the nape of her 
               neck as she moves her robe opens slightly carl notices 
               glimpsing her nakedness beneath it sam notices too he 
               freezes

                         life turns on a dime moll people 
                         think they have forever that theyll 
                         always have tomorrow but its not 
                         true sam taught us that we have to 
                         live for now for today

               molly can barely contain her tears carl moves toward her 
               moist cheeks and kisses them gently slowly he guides his 
               lips to her neck and kisses it too it is all hateful and 
               sensual at the same time sam turns away

               molly feels carls tenderness needs it she does not notice 
               his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling 
               it toward him with a little tug the cord unravels and the 
               robe falls open molly is confused aroused not sure what 
               to do she starts to pull it closed he holds her hand for 
               a moment they do nothing then his fingers reach for her 
               thigh her body quivers carl feels her openness and pulls 
               closer his hand rising gently up her naked body

               mollys eyes close she says nothing

                                     sam

               sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing 
               uncontrollably at the two of them unexpectedly his foot 
               kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and molly thats 
               sitting on an end table the picture crashes to the floor 
               the glass shattering

               molly jumps up the mood suddenly broken she sees the photo 
               and recoils carl reaches for her she backs away

               sam is stunned by what has happened he jumps up and tries 
               kicking over another picture but nothing moves his foot 
               goes right through it

               molly looks at carl drying her tears

               molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head yes carl 
               smiles

               int subway station  night

               sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway 
               station a train is just leaving he jumps on board

                                                                    cut to

               int subway train  night

               sam begins quickly casing the aisles looking for something 
               it is not there another train can be seen speeding past the 
               window sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it passing 
               through the walls

                                                                    cut to

               angle  sam

               disappointed suddenly an express train passes alongside 
               his local sam sticks his face inside it suddenly he smiles 
               and rushes onto it

               angle

               sam does not have to stand there long within seconds the 
               terrifying ghost he had seen before comes charging at him 
               we notice him more clearly now he is wearing a dark blue 
               pea coat there is a grizzled look about him he has stained 
               teeth and seems perpetually unshaven

                                     ghost
                         get off my train!

               this time sam does not back away he holds his ground the 
               ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal posters come 
               flying off the walls a bag of groceries topples from a 
               womans arms an old mans cane flies across the aisle a 
               boys mets cap flips off his head people on the train move 
               quickly to other cars

               unable to frighten him the ghost kicks sam in the stomach 
               sam recoils feeling it but gets back up again he is angry 
               now he begins raging at the other ghost the ghost is 
               shocked

               sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station sam is 
               trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger

               the ghost demonstrates kicking a garbage pail onto its side 
               sam cant quite tell how he did it

                                     sam

               with surprising energy the ghost flicks a bottle cap and 
               sends it shooting across the subway platform

                                     ghost

               he kicks a coke can toward sam sam tries to kick it back 
               and misses the ghost laughs sam gets angry he tries again 
               and falls on his head the ghost laughs louder now sam is 
               really angry we see him forcing the anger down into his 
               stomach he holds still for a moment and then kicks at the 
               can with all his might to his shock and amazement it sails 
               right through the ghosts head the ghost smiles

                         to go! im not supposed to be here!

               venom spews from the ghosts mouth suddenly he rams a 
               cigarette machine full force with his head the glass shatters 
               and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere he throws himself 
               on top of them with terrible longing

               pushes it off watching it roll across the platform with

               banking for special people we make it easy for you 
               something registers in sams eyes he yells and jumps straight 
               up hitting a subway sign with his finger with great 
               excitement he runs for the stairs and rushes from the

               with great hesitation oda mae begins to write we sense 
               that every word is a torment for her the nuns politely avert 
               their eyes from the check

                                     nun

               she growls again in the background we see the nuns secretly 
               peeking at the check one of them wideeyed faints dead 
               away the other nun stoops down and fans her face in an 
               attempt to revive her

               int carls office  night

               it is after hours almost everyone on the floor has gone 
               carl hunched over his computer is typing furious commands 
               on the keyboard he looks haggard and worn

               sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the 
               monitor screen sam sitting in a desk chair watches 
               smiling

                                     sam
                         search you bastard! youll never 
                         find it its gone
                              he smiles
                         theyll kill you for this carl you 
                         and willie theyll wipe you off the 
                         face of the earth

               in a moment of childish delight he pushes his feet against 
               the wall and the chair shoots across the room carl looks up 
               and sees an empty chair moving he stares at it in confusion 
               and then goes back to the screen he seems desperate nothing 
               is working

               panicked and frightened carl flicks off the machine and 
               storms furiously around the room sam approaches the computer 
               hesitates a moment and then pushes the power switch the 
               computer clicks back on carl spins around he stares at the 
               computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off 
               sam enjoying this reaches for the switch and flicks it 
               back on again carl stares at it

                                     carl
                         what the

               carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and 
               letters begin appearing on the screen he sits down 
               mesmerized by what is happening then his face grows tense 
               the word murderer is emerging before him

               carl flies out of his chair frantically running around to 
               see who else is on the floor he yells out like a madman

                                     carl
                              continuing
                         whos doing that

               there is no one there he hears the computer beginning to 
               type again and hurries back to look at the screen one word 
               appears sam

               carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist it crashes 
               to the floor electrical sparks go flying as carl gasps for 
               breath

               sam cannot hold himself back any longer with a horrifying 
               scream he charges at carl jamming his fist hard into his 
               ribs

                                     sam
                         you bastard! you goddamn bastard!

               carl grabs his side

                                     carl
                         ah!

               he hits carl again carl gasps in inexplicable pain

                                     sam
                         its dinner time carl dont you 
                         have a date with molly you creepy 
                         sonofa bitch

               sam keeps hitting deeper into carls midsection carl doubles 
               over as though hes going to throw up

                                     carl
                         jesus! oh god!

               sam is flushed with excitement carl kneels beside his desk 
               he cannot understand what is happening to him his face goes 
               stark white as the attack continues

               then unexpectedly the assault stops sam exhausted stares 
               hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor slowly 
               and dizzily carl gets up he looks fearfully around the 
               office and then holding his stomach hurries from the room

               int loft  the same night

               molly all dressed to go out is sitting in sams easy chair 
               asleep suddenly carl arrives knocking at her door he does

               willie is terrified steam rises from the sink willie tries 
               to get out but sam approaches him from behind and appears 
               to dig his hands into his neck willie crumples to his knees

                                     willie
                         oh god!

               there is a squeaking sound and willie looks up letters are 
               appearing in the fogged mirror he stares in disbelief as 
               the word boo! emerges before him he cries out

                                     willie
                              continuing

               glass and tiles explode willie is cut and bleeding he grabs 
               hold of the door and yanks it open

               int hallway

               willie rushes to the hallway charges for the back stairs 
               and stumbles down the three flights to the street carl 
               running down the corridor rushes after him willie drops 
               his gun carl picks it up

               willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk 
               people clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman 
               carl confused runs after him

               sam too races after willie unwilling to let him get away

               suddenly a man obstructs his way willie goes flying over 
               him and lands face down on the cement before he can get up 
               sam is all over him and does not let up people stand back 
               to watch as willie does battle with himself panicked he 
               calls out to a bystander

                                     willie
                         help me!

               people back away carl watches in terror he understands 
               exactly what is happening

               ext street  night

               willie blinded by his own hysteria runs wildly into the 
               street cars are bearing down on him from all directions he 
               does not get out of their way

               one driver sees willie coming and swerves to avoid him his 
               car skids another car brakes to avoid a collision and 
               suddenly both cars crash right into him

                                     carl

               willies body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles 
               as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and 
               writhing his ghostly form reaches out to people for help as 
               they rush past no one stops

               willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the 
               street suddenly he recognizes that it is his own dead body 
               lying there he begins to scream

               a bizarre and frightening clicking sound fills the air sam 
               looks up a group of strange dark figures has emerged from 
               the shadows

               with a loud terrifying shriek the dark forms swoop down 
               and grab hold of willie sam freezes in an instant they are 
               dragging willie kicking and screaming down through the 
               sewer grates into the bowels of the earth

               it sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the 
               bottom of the door pushing gently he moves the penny up 
               the door until its eye level with molly she watches it 
               amazed

               then to her astonishment the penny floats away from the 
               door and hovers in the air there is a look of wonder in 
               mollys eyes as it floats toward her

                                     sam

               molly stands there dumbfounded her face is completely white 
               after a moment she reaches for the penny it falls into her 
               hand there are tears in her eyes

               at her nervously uncomprehendingly she hesitates for a 
               long moment and then invites oda mae in

                         oh sam

               oda mae looks away uncomfortably the camera holds on her 
               face after a moment she turns around and addresses the air

                                     oda mae
                         okay damn it you can use me if you

               sam looks oddly at oda mae

                              continuing
                         come on before i change my mind

               suddenly he understands what she means

                                                                    cut to

               jukebox

               sams finger presses down two keys we see a record slide 
               out of its slot and move toward the turntable we know what 
               it is going to play

               angle

               oda mae closes her eyes unchained melody begins to play 
               sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously awkwardly 
               slides his ghostly body into her solid form we sense oda 
               maes discomfort gradually give way as sam emerges inside 
               her after a second her body turns slowly toward molly

               oda maes hand reaches out and with slow deliberate gestures 
               touches mollys hand molly swallows hard she closes her 
               eyes

                                                                    cut to

               angle

               sam it is as though he alone is there with molly his eyes 
               are full of tears he can barely move his hand glides slowly 
               down mollys cheek he seems to be in a state of ecstasy and 
               pain

               the experience is more than he can bear he pulls back

                                     molly
                         sam!

               molly reaches out takes sams hand and guides it to her 
               soft lips sam can barely breathe he seems totally absorbed 
               in the experience the sensation of human flesh

               his eyes are absolutely still and full of light he seems to 
               be glowing

               gently molly takes sams arm and guides him to his feet 
               effortlessly she draws him to the center of the huge loft 
               with great tenderness she puts her arms around him and before 
               he knows what is happening they are dancing it is a strange 
               touching image reminiscent of their first night in their 
               new home sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down 
               over her face caressing her forehead her cheeks her lips 
               she stands motionless her face shines she knows beyond all 
               doubt that it is him

                                     molly

               angle

               a loud jarring sound it takes a moment to realize that it 
               is someone knocking at the door the light slams back into 
               its shadowy substance and sam comes shooting back into his 
               ghostly form oda mae is standing with molly in the center 
               of the room sam is beside them he appears shaken and dizzy

               there is a another loud pounding at the door

                                     molly

               extremely weak barely able to move

               his ghostly functions are diminishing

               it is obvious that no ones home

               angle

               sam with great effort rushes at carl and attacks him with 
               his fists to his great shock he has no impact carl walks 
               right through him

               ext fire escape  night

               molly and oda mae are climbing the fire escape

               int loft  night

               carl runs to the fire escape window he looks out just in 
               time to see oda mae go into the 7th story window

               int new loft  night

               molly and oda mae run through a new loft that is under 
               construction it is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls 
               the fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them 
               half to death they rush blindly toward the front door it 
               wont open

                                     oda mae
                         back to the fire escape head for 
                         the roof

               oda mae reaches the fire escape window just as carl appears 
               on the other side she screams carl tries shoving the window 
               open it wont budge

               molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight there 
               is an opening at the top

                                     molly

               molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the 
               roof

               with a huge shove carl opens the window and rushes inside 
               the window slams behind him

               oda mae rushes back toward molly but her foot catches on a 
               loose cable and she falls to the ground

                                     oda mae
                         help us sam!

               omitted

               oda mae

               a hand falls on oda maes shoulder she spins around carl 
               is standing behind her she screams as he knocks her to the 
               floor

                                     carl

                         check

               molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream

                                     molly
                              screaming

                         doing what have you done!

               she descends quickly and runs toward carl

                                     carl
                         dont interfere! shes a thief its 
                         not her money

               carl kicks oda mae molly rushes at him attacking him 
               violently carl aims his gun at her

                                     carl
                              continuing
                         keep out of this molly!

               he grabs oda mae by the hair

                                     carl
                              continuing
                         where is it

               oda mae cries out

                                     oda mae

                                     carl
                         where

                                     oda mae
                         over there

               she points across the room

               carl sees the purse and yanks oda mae toward it yanking it 
               off the floor he tears through it like a wild man there is 
               no check he grabs oda mae

                                     carl
                         where is it goddamn it where is 
                         it

                                     oda mae
                         i gave it away

                                     carl
                         youre lying! dont lie to me!

               he aims his gun at her eye and is about to fire when 
               suddenly something shoves him to the floor carl screams 
               and jumps back tripping over oda mae sam is standing there

               in total panic carl scrambles to get up horrified he shoots 
               his gun blindly into the air molly and oda mae dive for 
               cover the bullets have no impact sam musters all his 
               strength and shoves carl again white with fear carl grabs 
               molly and aims his gun at her head

                                     carl
                              continuing
                         ill kill her you touch me and ill 
                         kill her i mean it sam just give 
                         me the check

               the gun is cocked at her temple no one moves slowly the 
               camera dollies toward carl

                                     carl
                              continuing
                         sam please i didnt mean for him 
                         to kill you its not my fault come 
                         on sam give me the check give it 
                         to me and ill leave her alone

               nothing happens carl looks nervous

               angle

                                     carl
                         sam sam

               in a wild explosive fury sam charges at carl and smashes at 
               his gun the weapon flies out of carls hand empowered by 
               an anger we have not seen before sam smashes into carl with 
               a violent force carls body careens into walls and 
               floorboards wiring snaps twobyfours crack

               carl crawling desperately to escape sees his gun on the 
               floor with a wild rush he grabs for it and shoots at the 
               door the lock explodes and the door flies open

               carl tries to run for it but sam cuts in front of him with 
               growing power sam sends carl flying back into the apartment 
               colliding into a tall scaffold bags of plaster topple to 
               the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air the 
               apartment looks like a scene from another world

               carl in a state of total unrelieved panic breaks away from 
               sam the dust obscures his escape like a trapped insect he 
               scrambles furiously to the fire escape window sam cannot 
               see him

               carl shoves at the window it is stuck with a supreme effort 
               he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass 
               half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing 
               the window shards of glass fly in all directions sam turns 
               and sees carl he surges after him but knows he cannot get 
               to him in time

               carl is halfway out the window when sams fist slams into an 
               electrical box attached to a dangling bx cable it goes flying 
               toward the window to his amazement it hits the frame a 
               huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down carl 
               looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his 
               chest before he can move it pierces him between the ribs 
               and slices into his heart his body quivers

               carls eyes bulge from their sockets his body begins to 
               spasm he cant get up a look of abject terror flashes 
               through his eyes he tries to scream there is no sound he 
               tries to breathe there is no breath

               angle

               with one last effort carl lurches forward to his amazement 
               his body stands up and pulls away from the window he looks 
               down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is 
               gone there is no blood excited and confused he turns around 
               and sees sam for a moment he cannot comprehend what is 
               happening

                                     carl
                         sam

               there is a strange silent moment between them

               then seemingly out of nowhere a terrible clicking sound is 
               heard frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness 
               carl looks behind him and gasps past the figures coming 
               toward him he sees his own dead body it is pinned to the 
               window sill

               before carl can cry out the dark figures swoop down and 
               envelope him in a flash his spirit is caught and surges 
               with the dark forces back into the shadows far in some 
               invisible distance we can barely hear him scream

               and then it is silent it is over

               angle

               molly is crouched in the corner her back pressed tightly 
               against the wall she is staring into space the room is 
               filled with plaster dust slowly emerging from the dust we 
               see sam approaching molly he gazes at her with terrible 
               longing

               suddenly a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling 
               and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze sam 
               turns to look at it his eyes are full of surprise and wonder 
               the spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him as he 
               looks down he notices that his hands are growing transparent 
               his body is beginning to fade a faint smile forms on his 
               face he leans down toward molly staring at her for a long 
               silent moment

                                     sam
                         goodbye moll

               mollys head lifts up she looks around

                                     molly
                         sam is that you

                                     sam
                              stunned
                         molly!

                                     molly
                         i hear you sam

               she starts to cry

               gradually we notice that the dust in the air near molly is 
               beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow to her astonishment 
               sams spirit is reflected in the floating particles

                                     molly
                              continuing
                         oh god!

               sams luminous form appears before her molly is overwhelmed 
               by the sight of him the two of them gaze at one another 
               without moving they know it is for the last time it is a 
               silent exchange charged with emotion

               slowly the two bodies reach forward as their lips touch 
               the plaster dust swirls sensuously through sams vaporous 
               image and he begins to disappear molly pulls back from him 
               as though from a cloud his voice rises from the mist

                                     sam
                         i cant stay anymore

               tears roll down her cheek

               the brilliant light intensifies it is beautiful like a 
               sunrise saturating the room with a warm comforting glow 
               molly looks up and sees it all oda mae sees it too

                                     oda mae
                         theyre waiting for you sam

                                     sam
                              smiling
                         i know goodbye oda mae
                              with deep felt 
                              gratitude
                         thank you your mama would be proud

               oda mae smiles warmly

               sam turns to molly she is gazing at the last remaining 
               moments of him her eyes brim over with tears and love

                                     sam
                         i love you molly ive always loved 
                         you

               molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes

                                     molly
                         ditto

               the light inside sam intensifies a sweet smile emerges on 
               his lips

                                     sam
                         its so amazing moll

               his face fills with joy

                              continuing
                         the love inside

               he whispers almost crying

                                     sam

               through the ceiling and in seconds he is gone the room 
               grows dark

               molly sits quietly on the floor there is a look of awe and

               takes her hand arm in arm supporting one another they 
               walk quietly from the room
