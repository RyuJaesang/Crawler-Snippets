          fade up on
          space infinite stars a title

          1870 the arizona territory
          we descend past dark clouds violent flashes ripple within
          thunder blends with drums as we reach a box canyon

          a bonfire  silhouetted bodies  apache warriors
          whirling around the fire  war paint  masks and headdresses 
          a religious rite or celebration on the periphery we find
          a beautiful apache woman softly singing to the even more
          beautiful baby in her arms as we follow them into 
          a teepee the simple melody of the womans song as she lays the
          baby on a blanket gently swaddling it love in her eyes
          but
          the wind starts to howl qraj and then a burst of
          light through the opening of the teepee  intense ultraviolet
          fwhoooooooooooooooshhss!!!

          the e ire tent is ripped up into the sky leaving the woman and
          her babyexposed!!!! she screams  grabs her child and starts
          to run  chaos everywhere as the tribe scatters in terror 
          suddenly  apaches are getting yanked into the air by some
          superior force  plucked savagely into the light gone  as we
          whip around the horror show of screaming disappearing indians 
          and now  a deafening shriek as strange domed objects hurtle

          down crashing like comets to the canyon floor and crushing

          fleeing people
          impossibly the objects are steel machines belly vents snap
          open and drill cones drop out  jagged teeth churn to life 
          faster  faster  as the drills begin chewing into the ground
          the woman  staggering back in shock and awe  clings to her
          baby for one final scream and  black over which we read

          seem to know that confusion drops the rifle looks down at
          his hands covered in blood and the bodies in his wake
          the wind loosens a piece of paper from wess jacket it dances
          on the breeze  flattens against the strangers foot he picks

          questions in his eyes sunlight shimmers off it and 
          memory flashcut! the spilled coins start sliding across the

          emmett holds his look against dolarhydes brave and
          unflinching doc cant help but grin at the kids moxie but
          its shortlived as his face suddenly falls

                         doc
          madre dios
          and we pan around dropping over his shoulder to see what hes
          reacting to 
          an enormous crater acres wide twenty feet deep even
          dolarhyde looks nervous now

                         dolaryhyde

          you tryin to tell me those things
          pulled the whole damn town into the sky
          and suddenly a weird crack shakes the canyon  like the sound
          barrier breaking  everyones look goes up where
          swirling dark clouds loom the same clouds that dropped the
          tornado on absolution and that appeared in jakes memories at
          the cabin but this time somethings shot out from them 

                         meacham
          that cant be good
          the plummeting object hits a distant dune kicking up a sand

          plume  rolling toward them 

                         dolarhyde
          scatter

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45
           everyone runs their horses aside as the object bounces over
          rocks  then slows to a stop
          they stare finally dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly
          dismounts draws his gun what he sees is shocking
          its an oval capsule of blue goo the outer layer some kind of
          translucent cocoon suspended within the murky jello is a
          ge dec shape motionless uhoh
          the others draw guns too converging around it in equal shock
          and fear but the thing doesnt move

                         doc
          should we open it

                         dolarhyde

                         emmett
           oops 
           and now we find emmetts already poking it with a stick a
          small tear in the cocoons outer embryonic layer  goo leaks 
          then it ruptures exploding as the horses rear away whinnying
          the goo spreads across the desert floor thinning out
          beat everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
          facetoface with the object inside lying there on the ground

          a cow yes a cow
          motionless dead in fact a metal tube jammed in its mouth
          connected to a valve in the nowflaccid bubbles outer shell

          doc dismounts moves to the cows mouth and pulls out that tube
          with a wet squishing sound thinking it through

                         doc
          this was stuck down its throat to help
          it breathe that means they wanted to

          she does the others follow in a chilled daze the last is
          dolarhyde glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes

          holy shit
          boom up to reveal a surreal sight in the valley below
          agambling riverboat nose buried in the sand paddlewheels
          facing the sky as if itd been dropped from the clouds into the
          desert just like that cow off their looks

          but ella doesnt seem as impressed as the rest of them in
          fact her attention is drawn behind them to something coming up
          over the dunes the barest flicker of a smile

          rain pours down through an open gash in the roof splashing the
          floor ella enters glances back toward the door to make sure
          shes alone then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool
          upper body naked in the moonlight we catch only a flash of
          this and for a moment its pure hotness
           until she turns and something else is revealed criss
          crossed lash marks on her back
          she turns away and starts to splash herself with water erasing
          the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face then a match
          ignites behind her she whirls startled covering her breasts
          with her arms  jake is sitting in a chair at the commodores
          desk casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth

                         jake

          she throws her shirt on but her skins wet and the shirt glues
          to her celebrating her shape in a way that cant be ignored
          jake tosses her his jacket as she slips it on she notices a
          bottle of whiskey on the table and the photograph of alice

                         ella
           shes pretty

                         then distant
          and shes dead

          wanna make it about goddamn love

                         ella

          trust me lonergan im not the same
          there is a force  a strength about this woman  that he
          connects with but remains true to character aloof

                         jake
          dont matter
          she takes a step closer soft intimate

                         ella
          so what dj= matter
          jake just looks at her then lifts the cheroot to his lips
          the flare of its tip casting him in a demonic light

                         jake
          what matters is i find the thing that
          killed her
          dark as hell
          and make it pay
          and now he leans forward with a focused look holds up his

                         bracelet

                         jake contd

          asked me if you didnt recognize it
          ella tightens pain in her eyes and jake realizes

                         jake contd
          those things they the ones who put
          those marks on your back
          she swallows a mixture of shame that hes found her out and
          anger at what was done to her

          another metal tentacle slithers in and grabs wade  swinging
          our men across the cavern where we reveal
           the tentacles are attached to a terrifying alien machine
          taggart and wade are pinned down on what looks like an operating
          table as they thrash restraining clamps enfold their skulls

          now the machine arms slip the men into separate translucent
          capsules metal breathing tubes are implanted down their
          throats as the capsules begin to fill with a thick blue liquid
          this is the same blue goo  a protective gel  that housed the
          cow in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert
          more worker bees load the cocoons into transport shuttlecrafts
          we see containment holds filled with bleating cows and rearing
          horses all going through a similar cocooning process
          all of this is overseen by the slaver who stalks up a ramp
          behind the cocoons the craft hums to life undergear

          with a grin taggart gestures for deputy wade to turn around and
          flattens the paper on his back using it as a surface to sign

          dolar gives his hat a tip then mounts up to go  and we rise
          up to the upper floor of the gold leaf saloon in the process of
          being rebuilt in grand style  and move in on a window where

          int bedroom  continuous

          trots back to ella whose smile widens as he closes the gap
          between them

          canyon floor  into those limestone tunnels where clusters of
          dynamite have been placed and as fuse meets explosive
          angle  jake and ella cresting a hill  b000000000000mi the
          thunder of explosions makes them rear they turn back to see

          the twin rivers geysering up into the canyon covering all

          evidence of the alien ship and q t
          ella folds her arms tighter around jake her heart full with a
          nod of private affirmation he spurs the horse with a hyai
          as the canyon behind them fills with rushing water jake and
          ella ride hard into the fiery sunset
          away from the past toward a future full of promise
