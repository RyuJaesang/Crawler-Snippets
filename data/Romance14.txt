          have a child and we didnt need a
          partner to make it happen

somewhat masculine bunch lori pregnant with a buzz cut

pastries and a pot of coffee

          why did you join a support group of
          unattractive militant lesbians
          when you have me

                    zoe
          because youre really not that
          supportive

                       mona
          sure i am

                    zoe

          feed my girls will end up looking

                    mona
          im just being honest and dont
          even get me started on what
          childbirth does to your bladder

                    zoe
          what does it do to your bladder

mona cracks up and then stops abruptly
                                                      18

          doctor says it will probably take
          several tries something about
          frozen sperm being lazy

                     mona
          good   take your time

                    zoe
          so should i call this guy   do you
          think that would be weird

                    mona

          pursuing someone at the exact
          moment in time that you might be
          most unavailable no because
          thats what you do you sabotage

ext farmers market  day

the farmers market is crowded with people we hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby

zoe spies the little goat sign but stan is not there    she
looks around the neighboring stalls for him but no luck

                      zoe
          oh well

she walks towards 14th street we see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station its not a big band just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads the
organics the country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around

as she gets closer she notices that stan is in the band
hes playing banjo

zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall olivias
berries olivia midtwenties natural beauty approaches

                    olivia
          can i help you

                    zoe
              distracted

zoe watches stan she mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint olivia sees that zoe is
looking at stan

                    olivia
          tasty huh

zoe nods and takes another berry

                    olivia contd
          all ripe and juicy and firm too
          bet you could just eat him up in
          one bite right

zoe now turns confused

                      zoe

                    olivia

olivia winks and moves off zoe turns back and is now face
toface with stan whos smiling from eartoear his banjo
slung over his shoulder

                     stan

          after all

                     zoe

          i was just in the neighborhood i
          thought id come by and get some
          blueberries im going to make a
          pie

                    stan
          i love blueberry pie

stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to zoe

                    zoe
          im confused i thought you made
          cheese or something

                    stan

                    zoe
          i dont know youre over there
          playing the banjo

                    stan

          your new friend

          nope
              to zoe
          come on let me show you around

stan puts his arm around zoe and leads her away   olivia
watches them go with her arms crossed
                                                        21


ext the little goat cheese stand  later

stan walks zoe through his cheese stand

                    stan
          this is our basic chevre probably
          our best seller the cheese that
          started it all as they say then
          over here we have our surface
          ripened cheeses these are the
          aged/raw milk cheeses
              realizing
          this is really boring huh

                    zoe
          no not at all

                    stan
          its like youre in a foreign
          country and the only thing to watch
          on tv is a documentary on cheese
          you dont want to watch it but
          somehow you cant stop

                    zoe
              laughing
          i think its interesting    really

                    stan
          all right you asked for it
              boring voice
          the aged/raw milk cheeses are made
          from raw milk and then aged for
          four to six months sometimes
          more sometimes less usually
          more depends on the cheese

int stans bedroom  later

its now dark zoe is asleep in the exact same position
suddenly we hear a loud grumble her eyes open

                    zoe
          what was that

we hear the grumble again    its her stomach   she puts her
hands over it

                     zoe contd
          whoa

zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the cheetos the bag
is empty she smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
then licks the orange cheese from her fingers
                                                         45


int hallway  moments later

zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways

                    zoe
              whispering
          stan

no one in sight   she waits a beat and then whispers louder

                       zoe contd
          stan!


int kitchen  night

zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen   nuts is with her

                      zoe
          stan    hello

zoe stands there unsure of what to do next then we hear her
stomach growl again her eyes turn to the stove something
smells out of this world she tiptoes over and opens the
pot its beef stew

                    zoe contd
          oh my god

she makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon
she cant find one she spies a loaf of white bread grabs
a piece folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it

                    zoe contd
              mouth full
          oh my god

she replaces the lid on the pot and now she just stands
there and stands there some more

                    zoe contd
          oh who am i kidding

she quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in this
time she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich she takes a huge bite

                       zoe contd
          oh   my    god

stew dribbles down her chin she takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one
                                                              46


nuts starts to whine and beg zoe uses her breadladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him it lands with plop

and now joan enters zoe and nuts turn their mouths
bursting joan doesnt quite know what to do all she knows
is shes supposed to be openminded

                      joan
            would you like a plate

zoe shakes her head no     wow   this is embarrassing

                        joan contd
            a napkin

zoe nods her head joan gives her one zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite

                        joan contd
            im joan

zoe nods   still cant swallow the bite

                      joan contd
            and you must be zoe

zoe nods again she tries to shake joans hand its the
best she can do unfortunately her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the cheetos powder joan pulls her hand back


int dining room  later

the dining room is warm and lovely theres faded wallpaper
and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier despite
the inviting room zoe looks very uncomfortable

                      edward

she might be enjoying herself nuts sits beside her

            read about them in the paper

                      zoe

            up with nuts i bought him from
            this pet store near my house six
            months later i had thousands of
            dollars in vet bills and had to put
            him in a wheelchair

                      edward
            you should have sued that place

                      zoe
            i thought about it but what was
            that really going to do they were
            still going to sell inbred dogs
            soi took the money i made when i
            left google and just bought the
            place figuring i would do better

                      stan

                    stan
          and you made a lot of money and
          then bought a pet store

stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze

                    stan contd
          i love that

                    zoe

                     edward
          its true
              to zoe
          when we bought this farm we just
          wanted to make cheese because we
          couldnt find anything we liked in
          the stores and now twenty years
          later here we are

                    joan
          sometimes in life you just have to
          take matters into your own hands
          make things happen your own way
          you know

zoe forces a smile   if only they knew


ext little goat farm  night

the moon is full and fireflies dot the air as zoe and stan
walk the grounds of the farm

nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair
this one is more rugged with mountainbiketype wheels

                    stan
          i cant believe that nuts has an
          offroad wheelchair

zoe stares at the cheese for a long time

                    stan
          youre kind of hard to read right
          now youre either seriously

ext dairy  moments later

the door to the dairy kicks open and stan carries zoe out
her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy


int house  moments later

stan carries zoe up the stairs they are tripping and
kissing and now tearing at each others clothes


int stans bedroom  night

stan throws zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt his
body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight zoe lies there
looking at him before he jumps on top of her
                                                          52


                    zoe
              under her breath

beat later we hear her vomit


int stans bathroom  moments later

            talking about sperm bank what
                                                    55


                    zoe
          i know this is so fucked up

the first time we actually see a little bump

zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap she
looks down at her feet in the stirrups sadly we notice a
perfect pedicure

          well your hormones arent helping
          and going through this without a
          partner must be difficult

dr harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the
device he turns the monitor so that zoe can see

          makes you reexamine everything
          like maybe i can be a stayathome
          mom and be barefoot and pregnant

the women stare blankly at zoe

          i dont think we can help you and
          quite frankly youre against
          everything we stand for

                    zoe
          but i thought we were all sisters

                     carol
          no  not you
              then
          do you know how long it took me to
          conceive five years i had three
          miscarriages and spent every last
          dime on invitro and dana the
          woman with the short hair

                       zoe
          which one

          the one with the really short hair

                     zoe
          yeah that doesnt really narrow it
          down much

            her   baby being born seconds after
            the   birth the birth mother changed
            her   mind and refused to give it up

zoes face changes     she starts to get it

                      carol contd
            so as you can see we are really
            dedicated and choosing to be single
            mothers and you seem to be in a
            slightly different place youre
            carrying two healthy babies and
            you have no idea how lucky you are

                      zoe
                after a beat
            youre right

                      carol
            i like you zoe we all like you
            but you kind of need to figure out
            where you are

zoe nods


ext shadybrook retirement community  day

complete a lap arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign

                      nana
            that man is obsessed with my ass

                       zoe
            i know   its kind of upsetting

                      nana
            he wants to take me on a cruise so
            that we can finally tie the knot

                      nana
            no reason to rush into anything

nana looks over at zoe     she sees the bags under her eyes
                                                           64

          honey im sure hes wonderful and
          im sure he loves you too but
          you have put him in a really
          awkward position having a baby is
          a big adjustment for any couple
          and youre not married and hes
          not the father and youve only
          been together a little while and
          now youre having twins and

                    zoe

          im just saying if he actually
          wanted to stay with you right now
          hed be the greatest man in the
          world and quite frankly i dont
          think any man is that great

they complete another lap around the courtyard   arthur
smiles at them and then raises the roof

                    nana contd
          arthurs just about the best man i
          know and look at him hes a
          fucking idiot

                      stan

            ive been trying to figure out what
            it is about you that i love so
            much and i think that its that a
            lot of people talk about doing
            things but you actually do them
            youre really kind of daring how
            you quit your job and took over a
            pet store all because some asshole
            sold you a lame dog you came and
            found me at the farmers market
            even though the night before i
            acted like a total stalker

zoe smiles at the memory      stan continues

                      stan contd

            kind of thing itsbrave and
            i cant love you for being that way
            but then walk away for the same
            reason

stan takes her hands
                                                          69

                    stan

zoe bursts into tears


ext perry street  later

a cab pulls up in front of zoes brownstone stan opens the
door for zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress while
its certainly hugging every curve and bump it looks great

                    stan

                    zoe

zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door

                       stan
          lets go     were super late

she tries to bend at the waist but the dress is too tight
then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around
but again the dress is too tight

                       zoe
          hmmmm
                                                           76


                    stan
          why dont you sort of go inhead
          first and then turn around

zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
down sideways on the seat stan tries not to laugh

                    zoe
          shut up and push me

                      stan

zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board

                    zoe

she sucks in her breath and tries to sit up as soon as she
bends at the waist we hear a horrific rip she bursts into
tears again

box of photographs

we follow her back into the bedroom and onto the bed as
stan slowly opens his eyes she holds up a photograph

his pov    its a picture of a womans ass

                       zoe
             this is my old ass

stan blinks a few times      his eyes adjusting

                       stan
             why do you have a picture of your
             ass

                       zoe
             my college boyfriend took it so
             i guess in fairness my ass doesnt
             look exactly like this anymore but
             its pretty close its held up

                       stan
             its a nice ass

                       zoe

             me so i thought id show you

she picks up another photograph this one is of zoe at
twelve and at her most awkward  short hair braces and
acne

                       zoe contd
             this is me in seventh grade

                       stan
             wow

                       zoe

                    stan
          you look like anthony michael hall

                     zoe
          this period as horrible as it was
          made me who i am i think every
          person should go through a
          hideously ugly phase it builds
          character
              then
          it also taught me that i should
          never under any circumstances
          have short hair and a perm again

she picks up another picture its zoe in a bathing cap and
speedo shes holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around nana

                      zoe contd
          this   is one of my favorites because
          look   how happy i am i dont even
          know   what place yellow is but im
          sure   its not good

                    stan
          fifth place

                    zoe
          but i still look super happy
          right thats all because of nana
          whatever i did she thought it was
          the best

the next picture is a halloween shot of bobby mona and zoe

          school and bobby passed out on my
          couch in college and never left
          you havent met them yet because
          they might scare you away

                    stan
          why are you dressed like that

                    zoe

          at the last minute and so bobby and
          i just look like idiots thats
          typical mona by the way
                                                        82

                    zoe
          this is the last picture of her
          that i have she lived for a few
          more years but we never took any
          pictures because she didnt want us
          to remember her like that i was
          eight when she died

                    stan

                    zoe
          she had a great laugh and really
          soft hands she used to rub my
          back before i went to sleep

zoe puts the picture on the bedside table propping it up
next to her clock

                    stan
          do you have any pictures of your
          dad

                    stan contd

          years before the end thats when
          my dad left her

                      stan

                    zoe
              after a beat
          its okay it was an important
          lesson thats when i realized
          that nothing lasts forever

this sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments

                    zoe contd
          so thats my story thats the
          real me

                    zoe

stan takes her hand and they stay like that for a while
just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room
finally the silence is broken by the telephone ringing

                    zoe contd
          thats weird

an inflatable baby pool and in this baby pool is lori who
is now naked and pushing

zoe watches horrified the brownie still in her hand    carol
is beside her playing the drum and chanting

                    carol
          hiyayahiyayahiyahiyaya

zoe covers her mouth it looks like she is going to throw
up she stumbles for the door

while loris eyes are closed zoe tries to sneak out    carol

          with her now

int loris living room  later

mothers by choicers join her in the chant

                    carol

lori lets out a scream as tabitha and the midwife pull her
legs back zoe watches with both hands over her mouth

                     zoe

          sssshh its perfectly natural
          sometimes the bowels just let go
              then back to chanting
          hiyayahiyayahiyahiyaya

the midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag   zoe
turns away gagging she drops her brownie

                    lori
              yelling

another wail

carol beats the drum faster as lori gets on all fours the
midwife lifts loris leg up to the side   lori lets out a
loud whalelike moan
                                                         89


                    carol
              excited
          here comes the head

loris moan turns into a donkeylike bray

                    jessie
          we can see the head lori

                    carol

zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room

                    lori
          god damn it zoe dont move!!!!


int loris foyer  same

out in the foyer stan is paralyzed   next to him is dakota
who is crying

through the hallway mirror he can see whats going on in the
living room a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag

                    carol os
          stan get the mirror!


int loris living room  moments later

stan walks backwards with his head down holding a mirror

                       stan
          excuse me     hello im stan
          excuse me     hi im stan

carol grabs the mirror and holds it under lori lori lifts
her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry
                                                           90


                    lori
          look at all that wet curly hair

stan steals a look starts to dry heave and rushes to zoe

                    stan
              freaking out
          lets get the hell out of here

                    zoe
          i dont know

suddenly we hear a huge scream

zoe and stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
plop into the water

cu of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
umbilical cord

cu of zoe and stans horrified faces

zoes eyes roll back and we

                                              fade to black

over black we hear silence blessed silence no drums no
chants no screams nothing until we hear the splash


int loris living room  moments later

we are close on zoes face    she opens her eyes   blinks a
few times

                    stan

                    zoe
          i dont know why am i wet

widen to reveal that zoe is lying in the inflatable pool
her eyes go from side to side the horror of the situation
becoming clear a spongy purple thing floats by

                    zoe contd
          what is that
                                                         91


                    stan
              afraid

zoes eyes roll back again and we

                                             fade to black

her voice trails off

                      nana

          on

                    zoe
          are you talking about my father or

int zoes apartment  day

zoe has her box of photographs   she pulls out a picture from
the very bottom

                    nana vo
          because if you dont learn how to
          forgive you will always be stuck
          in the past

the photo is zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
her that it can only be her father

after a long beat she puts it on her bedside table next to
the one of her mother the two pictures sidebyside make
up a family zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other

over this image we hear a quartet playing wedding music
                                                        101


int church  day

the music takes us into the church and there we find nana
lovely in her wedding gown and arthur dashing in his
morning suit standing at the alter holding hands both have
tears in their eyes arthur lifts her veil and gives her the
sweetest kiss

angle on zoe and bobby in the first pew passing a
handkerchief back and forth

of what a wonderful world

          you

zoe watches her hands on her belly   mona stands beside her

                    mona

                    mona
          is it happy or sad the words are
          happy but the song is so sad

                    zoe
          i guess its both   happy and sad

                    bobby
              singing
          i see skies of blue and clouds of
          white the bright blessed day the
          dark and sacred night

                    zoe

mona takes zoes hand

                    bobby
              singing

gown

zoe runs across 14th street the blanket flaps behind her
like a cape she looks like a hugely pregnant superhero

and suddenly she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction she leans against a parked van to steady
herself

                     zoe
          ow   son of a bitch that hurts

                    olivia

out of the corner of her eye zoe sees an enormous strawberry
on the side of the van and then next to it she sees
olivia

                    olivia contd
          are you in labor

bouncing towards him her gown starting falling off

look scared and she does not look alone

                                                        111


and we pull back and above the operating table and see dr
harris performing the csection he pulls out the babies one
by one

we follow the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed
back to zoe and stan

is she turns to the side and finds stan sleeping next to
her curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed

to the side of the bed are two bassinets   each baby sleeping
soundly in a little pink hat

and in the next bed is nana asleep with a bandage on her

          the first time we held hands was in
          here it started out as a high
          five but then i strategically
          turned into a handhold

                    zoe
          how do you remember that

                    stan
          we both agreed that we were totally
          sick of weddings and hated when
          people wrote their own vows

                    zoe
          thats right i remember that

          against me

                    zoe

and sara with dakota planted on her breast and a priest
and we

                                                dissolve to


int grays papaya hot dogs  later

zoe and stan still wearing the baby bjorns stand face to
face in front of the guests and the priest

                    stan
          i promise to love you even though
          you still eat chicken mcnuggets in
          bed i promise to name cheeses
          after all of our children no matter
          how embarrassed they are by it i
          promise to always check out your
          ass when you walk away and i
          promise to love you more tomorrow
          than i do today which doesnt even
          seem impossible

and slowly the sound of stans voice fades out and the sound
of louis armstrongs voice fades in

and we watch zoes face as she realizes that there are some
things that really will last forever

                                           fade to black

                    the end
