    screen is black
    in the darkness we hear dripping water the echoing
    approach of two sets of footsteps there is the sound of
    a sudden quick scuffle a heavy fall of bodies
    three booming gunshots two from one gun one from
    another so fast and close theyre barely distinguish
    able the sound of the shots echoes against concrete
    walls and dies away silence
    slow slow fade in

    is the bodyguard

    dead on his  feet leans against a car a gun drops
    heavily from  his hand his life ebbs as he slides slowly
    down the car  door to his knees then falls forward face
    down on the  cement floor
    a slow pull back reveals that frank is lying on top of
    klingman protectively pressed body to body on the
    filthy cement floor of the garage klingman a handsome
    50yearold arbitrageur gasps in barely controlled fear
    as his armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil there
    is no movement
    the two men are lying near the right front fender of a
    black limousine blood spreads from the body of the hit
    man a few yards away klingman starts to raise himself
    up but farmer keeps him pressed to the floor still
    alert for any further threat
    main titles begin
    a beat and voices are heard os   farmer wheels snub
    nosed 357 aimed at them

     passing traffic reveals the storefront of a tv showroom
     inside behind the reflections of the city lights all
     the tv sets are showing the same picture the glittering
     image of a woman singing we will recognize the woman
     as rachel marron we cut tighter and tighter on the
     image until it is almost broken up into its scanning
     lines through the city noise comes the sound of her
     song i have nothing

     a pair of translucent rubber gloves carefully they put the
     gloves on the snapping of the rubber is the only sound

     headline on the cover reads rachel marrons greatest

     frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree sun
     glasses on a glass of iced tea by his side strains of
     dont walk away renee come from a beatup transistor
     radio

     an oldfashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
     and forth over the freshly cut grass  throwing knives
     lay scattered nearby a wooden post is  sticking out of
     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard
     bill devaney fiftyish a distinguishedlooking black
     gentleman stands nearby trying to engage frank in a
     conversation that up to this point hasnt been going well
     hes rachels personal manager
                           devaney
              so you wont protect rachel marron
              just because shes in show business
                           frank

              business people
     frank says nothing his  eyes are  closed behind the sun
     glasses devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives
     he holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it it
     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the
     fence
     frank opens his eyes sees whats going on and closes his
     eyes again
                           devaney
                     picking up another
                      knife
              do you really do these things
                           frank
              isnt she the one who collects
              dolls
     this is enough to distract devaney from his knifethrowing
                           devaney
                     exasperated

he takes to be the first serious talk
                      devaney
          but were told youre the best
                      frank

         think this was for real
                long pause
         farmer she begged me to get you
frank sits up finally and looks at devaney a long time
he picks up five throwing knives and stands up
                      frank
         all right ill come and ill look
         the situation over if i take it

         for three grand a week
frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post     he
throws one of the knives it misses the post and
clatters against the fence
                        frank
         shit
devaneys face drops   frank examines the next knife
                      frank
                mumbling
         i know its something like
the second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from
devaney devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind
frank
                        frank
         sorry
frank raises his hand to throw again then stops and
motions devaney off to the side
                      frank
         better not stand right behind me
devaney smiles weakly frank lets the third knife go
with one smooth motion
the knife sinks an inch into the center of the post     thump
franks hand arching again     throwing the remaining knives
both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical
line with the first one

                                                                     8

     from the closed unmanned gate at the bottom of the marron
     driveway

     as he looks over the gate the wall the heavy vegetation
     and the rising grounds beyond
     note the use of the term franks pov is not to be
     taken simply as a camera direction rather it re
     presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in
     the special way frank sees frank lives by constant
     vigilance heightened awareness it is his genius and
     his burden the audience must be put in the position of
     looking searching scanning with him
     he has a curious sense of being watched a kind of prick
     ling on the back of his neck as he looks around a
     black toyota 4x4 parked some way down the road drives
     rapidly off  too fast to get a clear look he watches
     it go
     frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car he
     grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls the whole gate
     rattles frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button
     on the intercom   box at the side of the gate a mans
     voice crackles   out of the box transmission is terrible

     shelves containing the trophies of rachel marrons career

     her small son fletcher dressed in a tuxedo both are
     goofing off for the camera with obvious affection frank
     looks down at the pool
     franks pov
     dwarfed by the pool the only person in sight is seven
     year old fletcher the little boy from the photograph
     darkhaired and fragile he is crouched at the side of
     the pool with the remote control unit for a footlong
     speedboat which is cutting across the water a nanny
     sits some way off embroidering
     franks attention is distracted a heavier bass musical
     beat comes from somewhere nearby in the house another
     rachel marron number but this time uptempo and bouncy
     frank follows the sound

     frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is
     coming from
     it is large and comfortable with plenty of seating a
     bar a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth it
     is packed with people props and video equipment there
     is lots of activity a general air of barelyorganized
     chaos music blares out
     a group of six dancers is rehearsing an energetic dance
     number for a music video directed by their choreographer
     rory sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the
     glass wall at the end of the room a video cameraman
     circles them taping the rehearsal which appears on a
     largescreen tv behind them
     in one corner a pretty black girl is being pinned into a
     proposed costume for the video several people are stand
     ing around tending to the video and playback gear all
     the chairs face the far end of the room and it isnt
     immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among
     the big cushions
     as frank sits on the barstool at the back a large swivel
     chair turns to reveal devaney he waves to frank and
     makes his way over to him
     on the other side of the room a brawny heavyset man in his
     late thirties rises to look at frank he has a twenty inch
     neck devaney signals to him  that everything is all right
     the brawny man looks at frank a moment more then sits down
     frank looks around the room a shelf laden with vitamins
     guitars of various makes a flute a gold record being
     used as a coaster people smoking and chatting through
     the rehearsal

                                                              12


in one of the chairs a pretty  woman in her  midthirties
nicki the woman we saw at the  premiere is  knitting
she glances occasionally at the  dancers a   man sits next
to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at
the other end of the line

the music climaxes and abruptly stops the dancers hold
their dramatic final poses for a second then relax again
applause the clapping from the front sofa is loudest
then laughter
from elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the video
director

                      director os
         playback everybody!
rachels voice comes from the sofa
                      rachel os

the choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from
sight sound of kissing laughter
the video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather
round it expectantly
                      rachel os
         sugar thats gonna be great    i

starts behind him there are several overlapping
conversations going on

nicki responds to rachels question
                      nicki
         it was just great rory
but rachel is already replying to the video director

                                                               13

                one hand covers
                 the phone
         nicki im sure mr farmer would
         tell you the number of nuts
         writing fan letters jumps every
         time rachel is on the cover of
         a magazine
                      devaney
         not like this

                                                             16

an assistant hands rachel a small sheaf of phone messages
some papers for signature and a pen rachel checks
through them and signs as she talks
                      rachel

                to frank
         rachel runs a very informal
         household were all on a first
         name basis
spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in
                      spector
         and im sure youll blend in
         just fine you can select whatever
         alarm systems you want for the
         house some kind of improved
         security for the gate what else
         rachel
rachel stands and starts to wander over to rory and
the dancers
frank looks at devaney   devaney doesnt like the tone
this is taking
                      rachel
         i think im safe when im here at
         the house so i guess the main thing

         be able to fill you in on all that
         you two will have to work something
         out i dont want both of you

rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her
starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion
                      spector
                punching phone

         well have to tell the child you

                      rachel
         i dont want him to think   hes in
         prison so the house and    grounds
         must not be altered in any   way
         he shouldnt be aware that   youre
         here is that clear

frank looks at her a long time glancing up at devaney
once

a stand to rachel she ignores it still looking at frank

     devaney trots into the pool area out of breath he is
     holding a bulging manila file as he sees fletcher he
     holds the file casually at his side
     frank sees fletcher looking at the file
                           devaney

22   ext patio  day                                           22
     devaney slides the file across the table at frank open
     ing it inside are letters of every size and condition
     repeatedly throughout this scene franks gaze is drawn to
     fletcher who has started his boat again
                           devaney
              this is just in the last six months
                           frank
                     looks at the pile
              have you ever tried having these
              professionally assessed
     devaney shakes his head no
     frank begins to look through the letters flipping them by
     the corner of the page from many different sources some
     are scrawled some typed some assembled from cutouts

     spector enters sucking on a popsicle he comes to stand
     over franks shoulder peering nonchalantly at the piles
     of letters

frank goes through them quickly with an expert eye he
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully a few he
removes from the stack and places in the center of the
table
                      spector

                      frank
         i was two years with carter and
         four years with reagan
frank sets another letter in the center pile   he stops
smiling at it

                      frank
         this is a little old lady in
         akron shes written to
         everybody ive ever worked for
he continues to turn until something stops him several
letters are paperclipped together they are the pasted
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top
                      spector
         reagan got shot
his chatter is beginning to annoy frank
                      frank
         not on my shift
spector emits a gratuitous laugh acknowledges the joke
                        spector
         thats good
frank goes back to his letters   he taps the stack in
the center of the table
                      frank
         at first glance these dont
         bother me but keep them you
         never know
he separates one letter from the others
                      frank
         this could be something
devaney searches franks face
                      devaney
         you think it could be the same
         guy the one who rigged the doll

     sore point between them

                           spector
              we said thered been some electrical
              problem while she was on stage
              short circuit look she doesnt
              need that kind of worry right now
              it would upset her

              what about the police
                           spector

     glimpse of the 4 x 4 through the trees it starts to
     accelerate
     as it pulls away it is too far to record the license
     number he breaks into a full run toward the other end
     of the property
     leaping hedges frank crashes through tropical vegetation
     crashing through a bamboo forest he scurries down a
     steep wooded slope toward the road below the 4 x 4 can
     be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off

     4 x 4 roars past just   missing him and turns a corner
     hitting hard frank allows his knees to take the force of
     the fall deliberately rolling once before he springs
     into a crouched upright position

      rachels limousine is parked opposite the shop    its
      a decidedly downscale area a little way  off a   group
      of unemployed youths hang around eyeing the limo   with
      interest henry sits  at the wheel tony  stands   by the
      open window leaning against the car

                            henry
                      looking at the
                       youths
               i wish rachel didnt keep coming

49    int thrift shop  close on clothes hanger  day            49
      screeching as its slid along a metal rack
      rachel is shopping for bargains moving along racks of
      discarded clothing
                            rachel
               louise youve got too much great
               stuff
                            owner
                      from the back of
                       the shop laughing
               take it all darlin
      frank leans casually against a wall not watching rachel
      but watching the shop watching the street outside
      rachel finds something she likes
                             rachel
               wooo!   let me try this on
      she flicks a glance to frank hes not looking at her
      she pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing
      booth then stops dramatically

                                                            42

                      rachel
                to frank indicating
                 the open booth
         farmer do you want to come in
         here with me just to be safe
frank glances at her then resumes his surveillance of
the shop rachels head bobs up and down above the
curtain as she changes
                      rachel
         you probably wont believe this
         but i have a reputation for being
         a bitch
frank says nothing he gazes outside through the store
front window and sees henry and tony horsing around next
to the limo a few small boys stand around the car one
of them is climbing onto the hood
                      rachel
         i didnt used to be but you get
         known for being a certain way 
         a way people think you are  and
         pretty soon you get like that
         cant help it
frank smiles knowingly   rachel notices
                      rachel
         you dont think so youre such
         an expert on famous people
                      frank
         ive seen a few
                      rachel
         and you disagree
                      frank
                very flat
         you can be as you choose to be
         its an act of discipline
         sometimes but it can be done
rachel stops in her tracks then opens the curtains and
looks at herself in the mirror also reflected in the
mirror is frank
                      rachel
         that why you never stay with one
         of your clients they too
         undisciplined for you or is it
         youre afraid youll start to
         care about them

                                                         43

                      frank
                without interest
         thats right
rachel turns to frank
                      rachel
         cant you answer straight just
         once why dont you talk to
         me im not such a bad lady
                      frank
         youre too clever for me   i cant
         keep up
frank continues to search the shop and street with his
gaze rachel steps closer to him
                      rachel
         look at me farmer!
frank turns and looks at her
                      rachel
         you dont approve of me do you
                      frank
         disapprovals a luxury i cant
         afford gets in the way
                      rachel
         dont like emotions getting to you
         huh never mix business with
         pleasure
                      frank
         thats right
its a standoff after a moment rachel motions to
an outfit on a rack just behind him
                      rachel
         grab that would you
frank takes a beat   looks out the window
                      frank
         im here to keep you alive not
         to help you shop
fuming rachel sizes things up then grabs it herself
whipping the curtain shut behind her
a smile plays across franks face

                                                                     44

     we see a mans hands remove a video cassette from its
     sleeve the cover reads rachel marron  the #1 hits
     the cassette is gently eased into the slot of the video
     player

     rachels image appears on the screen singing softly
     intensely passionately into the camera we track into
     the image as if a little hypnotized by it
     angle frank
     frank sits alone in his room lit by the glow of the tv
     dressed in a businessstyle blue suit and tie hes
     watching rachels videos scattered around the video
     player are a collection of other rachel marron cds
     tapes and videos frank has been noting down lyrics on
     the yellow legal pad on his lap some of the phrases
     are circled
     as he watches we see a subtle change in his expression
     it is as if he really were looking at rachel for the first
     time here watching her sing for a second she seems to
     be singing to him alone passionate and vulnerable
     he opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled russian
     orthodoxtype cross he fastens the clasp checking that
     it holds then looks back to the screen

     apart from rachels collection of old and faded dolls
     on the shelves and on the bed rachel is getting dressed
     for the evening a hairdresser stands behind her
     fussing with her hair rachel hears the music coming
     from outside and moves to the window the hairdresser
     moves with her still busy with the brush gazing
     across the garden she sees the light in franks room
     and hears her own voice singing out from there too

     the mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which
     turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage
     faces of the fans are at the windows leering at rachel
     many are grotesquely painted some go into a wild frenzy

     others join in as the mob presses forward
     the instant she exits the car her expression goes public
      a wide showbiz smile sandwiched between spector and
     devaney with tony in front and frank at the rear rachel
     makes her entrance
     a young man breaks the barrier   moving toward rachel
     frank grabs him by one of his   belt loops gracefully
     guides him all the way across   and slips him under the
     opposite cordon into the arms   of a security guard

               but she handled it fine

     frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a
     wall of curtain ropes
                           frank
              one word
                           spector

     rachel scans the crowd spread before her like a surreal
     mural
     camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare
     the thundering adoration is like a stimulant she darts
     a look to frank and gives him a fierce naughty girl
     smile
                           rachel
                     turning back to

     from the wings billy thomas gives her the nod to go for
     it it seems to be alright with everyone the band
     starts playing a dance beat
                           rachel
                     on the prowl
              i think my feet are trying to
              tell me something wanna see a

                     dancing talking
              i want to dance
     she skitters to the other side of the stage baiting her
     fans her new video explodes across the video wall
     behind her the crowd surges forward
     two security guards nervously tense up watching the
     crowd when one fan tries to climb onstage frank
     reaches out and unbalances him so that the man falls
     back into the audience another man climbs the stage on
     the other side one of the guards darts out like a
     ballboy at a tennis match pushes the fan back and
     scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance the
     crowd is getting even more excited pressing closer
     trying to touch rachel
     the security guards move in but rachel gestures for
     them to back off
     angle  frank
     franks task has suddenly become impossible a forest of
     hands and faces start to engulf rachel anyone could be
     the killer franks eyes  dart over them all his gaze
     intense as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower
     rachels pov
     looking offstage at frank his frustration is almost
     intoxicating to her she struts over the lip of the
     stage a man leaps up from audience to join her frank
     starts forward rachel gestures to him to hold back
     waving him off

     onstage he catches franks attention yelling back
     defiantly

     rachel dances erotically with the man  bumping and
     grinding sinking to her knees the crowd roars
     approval
     frank quickly sizes up the scene he speaks into a surv
     kit microphone in his sleeve across the room we see
     henry listening pushing an earpiece to his ear henry
     quickly scurries to an exit frank starts moving toward
     the stage at that moment the lucky man rachels
     dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her
     gleefully like the dance partner she has been pretending
     to be one of security guards rushes forward to extri
     cate her the spinning man inadvertently bumps hard
     into the guard and the man loses his grip on rachel
     she flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of
     the stage  into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans
     the audience goes wild this is the kind of thing
     rachel was famous for when she was starting out the
     scene resembles a rugby scrum with rachel the ball

     frank sees rachel being passed over the heads of fans 
     deeper into the audience her dress is ripped and torn
     apart the silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears
     into the crowd
     close on rachel
     fear fills her face shes gone over the edge literally
     and figuratively shes lost control tony and the
     security guards are fighting to get to her slamming
     bodies out of the way in the bg the video continues
     on its serene uninterrupted way
     franks pov
     he spots a fire extinguisher in the wings
     back to scene
     frank grabs it and heads to center stage he aims the
     extinguisher at the crowd between rachel and the stage
     the chemical foam does its job scattering fans
     frank leaps onto the floor kicking a wildeyed young
     blond man in the chest as he fights his way to rachel
     taking her in his arms tony runs ahead of frank knocks
     a fan off the stage and waves for frank to follow

                                                                       56

                            tony

     he turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull

     tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a
     swath through the crowd rain beats down
                            tony
               make way here outta the way!
     a burly street regular gets a shove from tony and comes
     back hard the  crowd immediately sides with him yells
     encouragement  but tony is the better man and sends him
     sprawling the  rest of the way to the curb opens up
     at the parking area tony discovers there is no limo and
     turns in bewilderment to rachel but she is not there
     a couple of people laugh

     rachel and frank emerge from the darkness between two
     garbage bins and get into the limo henry has waiting there
     the car moves out with a screech of tires narrowly missing
     spector as he staggers out of the building
                           spector
               hey! what the fuck farmer!

     speechless

     dolllike alone in the center of   the large limousine
     seat her  hands rise to her face   and her body begins to
     shake with sobs as she sits there   alone in the tattered
     remains of her dress
     frank turns away to avoid staring at her but he feels

                                                                     57

     cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the
     riot footsteps approach walking pausing as if looking
     for something
     lying on the floor in big closeup we see a small  fragment
     of rachels dress the footsteps stop by it a    hand
     picks it up gently and lifts it out of frame we   hear the
     sound of a deep lingering inhalation of breath   the feet
     move on

     and french door rachel waits silently by the door
     all is clear he steps back to the door as he
     approaches her she begins to tremble
     he gently reaches out and takes her in his arms slowly
     holding her he leads her to bed moving aside some of
     rachels dolls laid out on the pillows
     her hands go automatically to her dress but they are
     shaking so badly she cannot undo it frank gently does
     it for her she willingly allows him to undress her and
     not a word is spoken between them as she sits naked
     still trembling he pulls down the covers and guides her
     gently into bed
     as he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of
     his hand he looks down stroking her forehead like a
     childs
                           rachel
              arent you going to ask me why i

     fully cutting and eating a peach  the door at the other
     end of the room slams open and tony stalks in soaking
     wet he has just made his way home  from the mayan and he
     is boiling he sights on frank and  moves toward him fast
     frank just watches until tony is almost upon him as
     tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt frank spins
     low out of his seat tonys legs are knocked out from
     under him he lands hard on his back and finds himself
     looking up at frank who holds him down with the chair he
     was sitting on like a lion tamer a leg strut pressed
     against tonys throat frank looks down at him question
     ingly as if to ask had enough
     tony scowls and nods frank lifts the chair away tony
     stands up and faces him frank turns away and tony
     throws a punch at his head barely catching him as frank
     ducks and moves in under it he hits tony twice and
     throws him against a cabinet tony gets up slowly looks
     around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall
     he holds it in front of him threateningly
     frank shakes his head hes getting irritated he picks
     up the knife hes been using on the peach and flips it in
     his hand so hes holding it by the blade with the same
     fluid motion weve seen earlier he throws it at tony
     it sticks in the wall an inch from tonys ear tony
     does a slow take and then lowers his blade frank picks
     up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink he glances
     at tony
                           frank

     covertly observed stalked a twig snaps and he turns
     sharply its rachel shes dressed in a soft jumpsuit
     and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him

                                                            59

the suit softens her appearance she looks lovely her
manner too has altered she is charming  friendly and
very girlish
                       rachel

                         frank

         doing
                as frank nods
         you didnt know i jogged did you

frank shakes his head
                      rachel
         whats the matter fraid ill
         get picked off in my snazzy running
         suit

         with you
they both smile
                        rachel
         great    i guess i cant do it
rachel stops pumping gasps for air and for one moment
rests a hand on franks arm to support herself she
removes it quickly
                      rachel
         will you walk with me a little
frank nods and they cut off across the grounds
                      rachel
                hard for her
         i know this is kinda late but
         thank you im really glad youre
         here
                she looks at him
         im going to try to cooperate
                      frank
         that would be good
they walk in silence for few moments when rachel
finally speaks she sounds genuinely unsure of herself
nervous its very appealing and if its an act shes
a terrific actress

                                                                   60

     the sound is deafening a wet car comes out of the
     tunnel of machinery in the distance glimpsed through
     the spinning brushes henry talks to a couple of workers
     as he waits for the limo to be cleaned

     hands appear with a large chamois cloth moving easily
     and fast over the hood and windshield a black in his
     early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car
     a second pair of hands appear    white hands in rubber
     gloves they open the  drivers   door and push a vacuum
     suction hose inside  the hands   switch on the car radio
     loud loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car
     the hose works its way over the   front seats

     we see the owner of the hands it is the young blond
     man frank kicked aside at the mayan his name is dan

              queen of the night i have
              nothing
     the song begins and rachels voice fights the din in
     the back of the car dans hose probes around nosing
     into all the crevices of the upholstery it sucks up a
     crumpled presigned photograph of rachel from the gap
     beside the rear seat the hose is switched off and the
     gloved hands retrieve the picture

     padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo
     inside
     as the hands remove the rubber gloves the inside of the
     locker is revealed pasted over every inch of the locker
     are pictures of rachel marron one tabloid shot of her
     dancing with the word whore scrawled across it taped
     to a single sheet of white paper in the center like a
     holy relic is the torn scrap of rachels dress from the
     mayan the hands pin up the newlyacquired photo next to
     it

     scarf and tinted glasses the combination    goes a long
     way toward disguising her they pause at    one of the dis
     play windows inside is a poster for the    movie yojimbo
     a large picture of toshiro mifune looking   scruffy and

               wanted to die to me
                           frank
              theres a big difference between
              wanting to die and having no fear
              of death
     they walk down the sidewalk
                           rachel
              and because he had no fear of
              death he was invincible
                           frank
              what do you think
                           rachel
              well he sure creamed em all in

          crucial moment id cop out
                       frank
          that happens

                 begins to laugh
                  cant help herself

              no nice try though
                     pause

              she didnt love me anymore can
              you imagine such a thing

     frank puts a smiling spin on this last its pretty
     charming rachel looks at him

              no not really

     surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this
     close to her
     rachel hums softly picking up the words to the song   as
     we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head
                           rachel

     suddenly a dish drops to the floor frank still dancing
     makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between
     rachel and the noise his head turns to locate the source
     of the noise

                           rachel
              dont worry ill protect you

     and other memorabilia she glances at a dusty framed
     photo of a football team

                        frank
         no    fast
rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai
sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall she
looks at it peering closely
                      rachel
         you some kind of a samurai too

frank smiles
                      rachel
         they said you were in the secret
         service what made you get out
frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall
                        frank
         money
rachel looks around at franks modest home
                      rachel
         i can see your tastes are
         extravagant
she looks at frank and then back at the sword   she
reaches out to touch it
                        rachel
         may i
frank nods rachel takes it off its mount carefully
unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off
                      frank
         watch yourself
rachel slides the scabbard off the naked blade is
breathtaking rachel holds the sword out before her
she walks toward frank then stops and looks over the
blade at him
                      rachel
         youre a hard one to figure frank
         farmer
he stares at her she steps closer so the blade is only
about a foot from his face

                                                                      68

                           rachel
              it seems to me a bodyguard must
              know little peace
     frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only
     about an inch from his chest he reaches out over the
     blade to rachels neck and unties the silk scarf she is
     wearing there one hand draws the scarf away the other
     hand lingers for a moment on her neck then lifts away
                            frank
              watch this
     he has raised the scarf over his head in   the space
     between them with two hands he spreads    it out and then
     lets it go slowly billowing the scarf    floats down
     over the blade and is cut in two these    two pieces float
     slowly to the floor
     frank takes rachels wrist and moves the sword away to

     frank is kneeling with fletcher beside the pool hes
     putting new batteries into fletchers boat fletcher
     watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the
     batteries much preoccupied
                              fletcher
                        watching him
                 shes real mad at you isnt she
     frank stops what hes doing and just looks blankly at the
     batteries in his hands theres a beat of silence
                              fletcher
                 she told me she doesnt understand
                 why youre so shitty to her
     franks shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible
     sigh he gently resumes fitting the batteries still
     not looking at fletcher in the quiet of early morning
     its almost like a confessional
                              frank
                 ive spent a lot of time learning
                 not to react to things like other
                 people do its my job but it
                 doesnt always work fletcher
                 it doesnt always work

                 and im starting to get the
                 feeling i never will

     around

              everyone said she was a sure thing
              of course you know all about that
     she raises an eyebrow gives him a look frank looks
     steadily back at her she drops a small pile of mail
     beside the magazines several letters and a small
     packet shes embarrassed by franks gaze
                           nicki

              its none of my business heres
              todays question marks for you
     she turns and walks briskly back to the house frank
     watches her go then looks slowly down to the pile
     from across the pool fletcher watches silently then
     pushes his boat out into the deep water

     still hidden by packing paper he picks it away with
     tweezers suddenly there is a loud buzzing from the box
     and movement in the paper frank drops the box into a
     bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags
     the movement slows and stops frank extracts the item 
     it is a windup mechanical beaver with a handpainted

      bodies displayed before her in words and expressions
      playing to the camera
                           rachel

gets the point and then shes off again the throng
gets tighter franks having to work harder steering
her towards the door back into the hotel the familiar
chant starts up rachel rachel its starting to
resemble the frenzy of the opening scene this time
amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces a few
bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved

and bermuda shorts a distraught mother tries to reach
him someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd
surges again
amid the chaos whistles and scattered applause   rachel
drinks it all in
                      rachel
                over her shoulder

      a moment he walks across the room to the sliding doors
      that lead to the balcony outside

      it is peaceful and quiet a relief
      on the katzs balcony forty feet away little mark katz
      is leaning against the railing staring at rachels

                      softly

      rachel and portman are still locked in the clinch
      realizing what shes doing rachel suddenly pulls back

                                                                   88

      she steps out of his embrace
                            rachel
               i said i was grateful   thank you
               and good night
      she looks to the door that leads back to the party the
      sounds of celebration continue outside she starts to
      cross to the door
                            rachel
                      cool
               please go now
      portman moves toward her as she opens the door reaching
      for her arm
      then he sees through the doorway tony standing in the
      hall talking to a woman tony looks up at the sound of
      the door and sees them both rachel slips quickly out
      of portmans grip
                            rachel
               mr portman was just leaving us
               tony
      portman hesitates then smiles at rachel and tony and
      with a quick peck on rachels cheek slips past them back
      to the party
      rachel briefly scans the party crowd over tonys shoulder
      but she doesnt see frank the door closes leaving her
      alone in the room again she reaches for a bottle of
      scotch and raises it to her mouth drinking straight
      from the bottle

127   ext balcony  night                                       127
      frank looks out at the ocean
      echoing on the soundtrack we hear the song what becomes
      of the broken hearted that rachel and frank danced to
      it sounds slow and sweet and a long way away
      frank stares out at the ocean totally divorced from
      everything in the suite behind him in the world around
      him there is only the moon and the ocean for this

                                                                     89

       place with breakfast she is pouring orange juice as

       been a terrible effort she looks at the breakfast with
       distaste and picks up the coffee frank continues to eat
       rachel looks at him

frank walks along checking the corridor        at each door
way he stops looks inside
one room is dark he flicks on the light near the door
is a pile of wooden crates placed unnaturally out from
the wall  frank walks over and looks inside they are
discarded vegetable crates frank goes back to the door
and yells toward the kitchen
                          frank
            gomez!   louis gomez!
he waits impatiently no one comes two quick steps and
he is back at the crates throwing them violently into
the corner where they clatter loudly to the floor frank
walks on along the corridor

he stops noticing something around the side
he investigates
an enormous cuban is sitting on some boxes in the
shadows he doesnt bat an eye when he sees frank
                         frank
            what are you doing
                         enormous cuban
            is none of you fuckin business
                           frank
            move it
the enormous cuban gets slowly up from the boxes        he
towers over frank
                         enormous cuban
            shove it up you ass motherfucker
frank has had   enough for one      afternoon he hits the
cuban low and   hard the man       crumples forward hurt
but manages to   enfold frank      in an awesome bear hug his
weight carries   them backward      in franks direction
the cuban continues      moving in that direction but frank
is no longer in his      grasp instead incredibly frank
seems to have passed      through the mans body and flicked
him into the corner      of the stairwell
the cuban hits the wall hard jarred but not lost he
comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a
baseball bat
frank steps in and      under the mans long arms and hits him
four times around      the chest and jaw each of franks
hands lands twice      their movement is barely visible
the solid thudding      tells the story frank strikes both

                                                                    94

       the cubans ears simultaneously with cupped hands
       the cuban goes down stunned frank his expression
       fierce is upon him immediately franks arms entwine
       the cubans and he begins to lift him roughly at the
       end of the corridor a woman screams

                       cleaning woman os
                stop! please dont hurt him
                please stop!
       frank looks up a hotel cleaning woman carrying her
       purse is running towards them tears already on her
       face
                             cleaning woman
                dont hurt my husband mister       he
                not up to nothing
       frank lets the cuban down gently and stands up dis
       gusted with himself breathing hard he leans back
       against the wall the cleaning woman falls to her knees
       and hugs her husband protectively
                              frank
                im sorry
       frank steps away rubs a hand through his hair tries to
       collect himself
       hes standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes
       he looks up and sees a marquee

         somewhere people dont know about

                            frank
               if you cross me up this time ill

      for the evening meal with a practiced hand rachel
      watches drink in hand looking around the kitchen it

      in the distance rachel and fletcher have just reached
      the house where nicki scoops up fletcher and spins him
      round and round in a circle she hugs him close and
      kisses his hair  after a few moments fletcher squirms
      free and runs to catch up with rachel

153   int hallway  later                                       153
      rachel munching on a raw carrot browses a row of family
      photographs the sounds of dinner being prepared come
      from the kitchen
      we see the history of the family in the pictures frank
      as a tenyearold baseball player with a younger herb
      herb as police chief of bend oregon being given a civic
      award frank as a college football wide receiver herb
      and katherine farmer all dressed up and being introduced

      portmans also smiling at the women flirting frank is
      in a familiar pose alert unsmiling vigilant rachel
      looks at the two of them for a second
      frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a
      drink for rachel in his hand he watches her for a
      moment as she studies the photo
      she turns and sees him they lock eyes for several
      seconds she smiles as he hands her the drink
                            frank
                      inclining his head
                       toward the photo
               portman sometimes had trouble
               remembering what his job was
               suppers ready
      we can see from rachels face that she feels embarrassed
      about her behavior in miami

154   int dining room  later that night                        154
      the meal has been enthusiastically consumed fletchers

      and drippings rachel shakes her head laughing

       ing a darkcolored ski mask  his breath billows out of

       hears frank approaching and points his gun in the
       direction of the footsteps  he does not fire silence

       hears the intruder move the sounds have stopped up
       ahead close

       confident he waits nothing
       frank from his crouch does something brandnew he
       raises his gun into the fog in a twohanded grip ready
       to fire he holds it easily and then he does something
       really strange frank closes his eyes after a beat we
       hear movement frank eyes still closed swings his gun
       15 degrees and fires two blasts
       the man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered
       six inches from his shoulder his eyes are wild behind

      quarter of the way up rachel appears at the top and
      begins walking down

      at first she doesnt see frank when she does she
      hesitates a moment then continues down they meet and
      try to sidestep each other but twice they go in the
      same direction unable to get around rachel already
      emotionally ravaged cracks she begins slapping frank
      hard about the face and torso one of the first blows
      knocks the glass from his hand it smashes loudly against
      the wall he raises his arms in a halfhearted attempt
      to protect himself from the onslaught she cries as she
      hits him
                            rachel
                      hysterical

               after and you let them kill her!
                      she gasps for air
               she never did anything to anyone
      as she loses the strength and the will to hit him her
      blows become sloppy weak she sinks to the steps
      sitting on them sobbing
                            rachel
               she never hurt anyone she was
               good
                      she looks at him
                       entreats him
               you saw her she never wished
               anyone any harm did she did
               she
      frank looks at her shakes his head no rachel puts
      her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments
      her crying slows
                            rachel
                      finally quietly
               she never hurt a soul
                      long pause
                i didnt love her well enough
               i didnt take care of her
                      a beat

       tranquil in the moonlight

       proaches and stands beside him its rachel

                       frank
         maybe
rachel takes this philosophically     she tugs at the
grass thinking
                      rachel
         when i was back in squirrel hill
         i started betting my friends
         fifty bucks each that someday id
         win an oscar you can understand
         how important it is that they see
         me up there if i win
she looks at him and smiles
                      rachel
         if everyone of those pikers comes
         through it could add up to a lot
         of money
                      frank
         i think its very dangerous
                      rachel
         i know but i cant stay up here
         on my hill forever
they are silent for awhile     rachel lies back on the
grass stares at the sky
                      rachel
         i didnt get to this place in my
         life by doing the smart thing
         every time
                as frank nods
         how bout you frank farmer out
         there on the edge did you ever
         do something that didnt make too
         much sense except maybe inside
         you in your stomach somewhere
         something that wasnt smart
                looks at him
         ill bet you have plenty ill
         bet you do nobody gets really
         good without it and youre good
         i know that
she sits up beside him

                                                                       123


                            rachel
               i dont know why all this has
               happened to me

      the bright glare of the lights   at the front of the
      podium is the transparent plastic  of the teleprompter

      vertically

               endeavors those among us may take
               let them never be without your
               sanctuary
      the camera stops standing against the wall behind the
      table is frank as the reverends prayer goes on all
      heads are bowed to receive the benediction all heads
      but franks the camera moves in tight on his face
                            reverend hardy
                for all we know in our hearts
               that even though we may walk
               through the valley of the shadow
               of death you are with us
               guiding and protecting us amen
      the reverends final words segue into rachels song
      franks searching gaze around the room is arrested for
      a moment as though reacting to rachels voice

      rachel ends a phrase she dabs at the corner of her eye
      as she continues the song that still binds them together

      very close on frank
      his expression so intense in the opening scene of the
      film is softer now rachels voice continues as frank
      carefully scans the room
                                                fade out
                              the end
