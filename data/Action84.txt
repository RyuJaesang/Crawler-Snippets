          int church  continuous

          jerry heads down the aisle painfully selfconscious most of
          the mourners are in the pews turning to look at him as he
          passes when suddenly theres a scream of terror  and jerry
          braces as if he was expecting it  looks over at a woman
          pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses 
          jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him

          jerry
           no! i im not him!
          all eyes on him his voice sad heartbroken

          jerry contd
          its okay! im not paul!
          locks eyes with his mother and father up in the front pew
          their eyes red from crying withered shells and jerry gives a
          lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the coffin
          devastated he leans in  and we move around to see the body
          and its fucking him  jerrys very own face but one that
          seems to have been reconstructed after some kind of accident
          gruesome and handsome all at once this was paul shaw jerrys
          identical twin off the surreal moment

          jerrys eyes find a point in space this is love by proxy and
          now he hugs his father in support not unity william pulls

          as grant watches the chopper take off perplexed

          ext middle of nowhere  day

          an endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers
          two figures like specks against the landscape  jerry and
          rachel walking wet cold and then

          rachel
          so youre a twin

          beat
          who works at a copy place
          and she manages a clipped judgemental frankly rude laugh

          jerry
          yeah i know thats occurred to me

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 40

          continued

          rachel
          so this whole situation is obviously
          about him

          jerry
          excuse me i would offer this whole
          situation isnt obviously about
          anything

          rachel
          just think about it you said your
          brother worked at the state department 

          jerry
           so what

          rachel
           so that means he couldve been into
          anythinc  he was a twin  youreceived
          a shipment of weapons and cash and
          airplane manuals  it seems to me that
          they sent the stuff tothe wrong brother

          jerry
          wait a minute  youre suggesting all
          that stuff was for paul
          as they approach tower 108

          rac he l
          hey im sorry that he died im not
          trying to insult his memory 

          jerry
          he hasnt been dead long enough to
          become a memory! and if you knew paul
          which you did not youd laugh all day at
          the idea that he was a spy or terrorist
          or whatever youre implying 

          rachel
          im implying if not him then why you

          jerry
          well hasnt that been the question my
          whole life you know how i know paul
          wasnt a terrorist because if he had
          been he wouldve been the best fucking
          terrorist in history he wouldnt have
          gotten caught the united states would be
          a crater  he wouldve won awards for
          being a great terrorist

          then
          what about you whyd she choose you 
          whats your day job i know it isnt

          that blast was the result of one single

          you who are new today rex is an
          isotope that leaves no chemical markers

          weapons developer
          hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency
          undetectable to the human ear for this
          test we made it audible  that was the
          tone you heard before the explosion 
          the tone was the trigger

          callister
          whats the risk that another sound could
          accidentally detonate it
          half smile

          latesha studies the feed somethings not right
          then her eyes narrow the way pauls facing the button panel
          like hes deliberately pivoting away from the camera

          its the only spot in the hallway not
          covered by the cameras

          low
          he was hiding something from her
          a shift to aria cam confirms it she cant see exactly what
          theyre doin
          latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher starts examining it
          for something anything but finds nothing

          rumbling down to flatten everything
          the compactor operator looks over as scott and latesha wave

          heard it looks up and it moves again and now she sees the
          ubiquitous cameras watching aria
          the arm starts coming down! scott cries out! grabs latesha by
          the jacket and tumbles out of the compactor but not before

          kyle turns on the tv eagerly plugging in the playstation  we
          catch a snippet of the news callister being sworn in in front
          of a congressional review committee 

          news anchor
          sources inside the beltway say the
          senate is convening an investigative
          committee to look into what could very
          well become the biggest coverup since 
          oblivious kyle flips on the video game and the screen changes
          to the playstation logo the kids cheer they cant wait but
          the screen fritzes and goes blank

          friends
          aw what the hell! its broken!
          a prompt appears with a blinking cursor then words scroll

          hello kyle
          the kids look at him confused kind of freaked out kyle
          stares at the screen eyes riveted his breathing quickens
          close the cursor  blinking like a beating heart and we

          slam to black
