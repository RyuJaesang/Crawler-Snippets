               your honor i dont have to tell you that
               none of this is admissable or applicable
               to the case at hand mr russells
               histrionics do not erase the fact that
               his client is in breech of contract

                            judge
               he is right mr russell what do you have
               to say

     steven is stonewalled he looks to eudora as if to say
     what do i do now and it terrifies her

     desperate steven bangs his fist on the table and looks
     resolutely to the judge

                            steven
               i demand to be seen in chambers!!

     the judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response

                            judge
               okaaaaaaaay

     the lawyer sits impatiently while steven peruses a wall
     of plaques photos and diplomas he focuses on a law
     school degree from indiana college of law next to it a
     photo of the judge as a young man on a farm hes from
     humble roots

     a moment later the judge enters

                            judge
               okay gentlemen lets get this over with
               the two for one at the crab boiler ends
               at five oclock

                       lawyer
          this seems to be cut and dried here sir
          i dont even know why were back here
          mister russell is treating this like an
          episode of matlock

                       steven
          ill admit your honor im a plain spoken
          man i didnt go to princeton i didnt
          go to yale my education was modest i
          went to a small school i grew up on a
          small farm but i passed the same bar
          exam as my colleague here and i am not
          going to let him push around this humble
          woman

this scores with the judge

                       judge
          point taken mister russell

he glares at the other lawyer with scorn

                       judge contd
          but where are you going with this

                       steven
          i think its obvious where im going with
          this sir

a long silence the judge waits and waits until something
occurs to him

                       judge
          are you talking about marshall vs chao

steven doesnt know what this means but the other
lawyer does and hes not happy

                       lawyer
                 sotto

                       steven
          your honor thats exactly what im
          talking about

      at his desk steven leafs through the company finances

                             steven vo
                it occurred to me to set up an investment
                account where the held money would earn
                interest for the short time that the
                company had it were talking twenty two
                million at any given time here so even
                short term the interest adds up pretty
                quickly id be making the company
                millions virtually overnight

      he leans back to think to himself

                             steven vo
                and i of course would take a
                commission say fifty percent the
                only problem with that was i wasnt the
                one signing the checks

      open close on a check being signaturestamped with a
      rubber stamp a hand places the stamp into a small wooden
      box and closes it

      cut wide to reveal the hand belongs to vera the company
      accountant and steven is standing over her it is now we
      realize we are revisiting an earlier scene

                             steven
                so i ask dont you think thats a
                little expensive and the lawyer says
                yes it is now whats your final
                question

      vera explodes with laughter

                             vera
                its so true lawyers!

      she turns to a colleague

      comparing numbers close ups on headings like interest
      earned and deposit indicate hes looking for something

      he continues to make notes growing ever more suspicious
      until something catches his eye

      in the margin of one of the pages is a doodling of a
      smileyfaced penis

      birkheim doesnt quite know what to make of this but
      it seems to stare at him mockingly

      cant get it open
      i love you phillip morris   green pages    52308     77


      eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it
      closely he grabs a pencil and does the old detective
      trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written
      on the now missing page above

      the embossed text reads 83750212

      he stares at it a moment this number looks familiar
      he grabs the phone and dials an automated voice answers

                             automated teller
                hello youve reached the automatic

      flips through birkheims desktop calendar

      its the same number as on the pad he hangs up and
      turns his attention to the calendar he spies an entry
      that reads harris county police 1230

      he leaps out of the chair and exits the office

      he hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the
      cacophony of the prison masks any sound of his grief

      paying much attention to their passenger

      in the rear steven nervously and quietly prepares an
      insulin syringe and inexpertly injects it in his belly
