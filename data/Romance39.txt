	others the most prominent one is called bluntman and 
	chronic  a hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame
	holden opens the comic and flips through it he shakes his 
	head  banky looks over his shoulder

					banky

			come  issue two  on the shelf

					holden
			yippee

					banky
			dont start alright!  this is a cool 
			moment and id appreciate you not 
			trying to ruin it  how often does		
			a guy get the opportunity to purchase 
			something with his name on it!
				points to name on cover
			banky edwards right!
				points to the other
			holden mcneil
					holden
			i know my name
					banky
			cmon sour puss  we got the rest of 
			our lives to be artists  but its 
			supply and demand  and right now		
			the unwashed masses demand this
					holden
				off comic
			this is easy alright!  and right now 
			it pays the bills  just dont forget 
			that were better than this
					banky
			ill tell you who were better than 
			these two fags right here
	they approach the counter where stevedave the store 
	manager and walt the fanboy play a card game
					banky
				lays books on the counter
			alright oldmaids  take a break from 
			the crazy8s marathon and ring us up
					stevedave
				not looking up
			well wellwell walt did you see who 
			it is!  the local celebrities  quick  
			get them to autograph one of their 
			books so we can sell it for triple 
			its value
					walt
			im not that in need of fifteen cents 
			right now
	they snicker and highfive one another  holden rolls his 
	eyes
					banky
			you guys operate the smallest ladies 
			bridge circle ive ever seen
					walt
			for your information were playing 
			crimson mystical mages  an 
			overpower card game not that either 
			of you would give a shit about 
			something as advanced	as this  
			there are no dick or poopie jokes 
			involved
					banky
				to holden
			i dont think theyre fans
					walt
			no were not  youre both a couple 
			of fucking no talents that got lucky
					stevedave
			and obviously your handlers or hangers
			on convinced you that your first comic 
			was good which it was not it was 
			thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky 
			bits of dialogue  and when you get 
			your foot in the door of the business 
			what do you do!  you turn out a piece 
			of shit like bluntman and chronic
					walt
			tell him stevedave
					stevedave
				off comic
			bluntman and chronic  pah  
			what was that thing the little stoner 
			pulled on the villain in the last 
			issue!
					walt
			the stinkypalm
					stevedave
			stinkypalm  you give comics a bad 
			name i tell all my customers not to 
			buy it to spend their money on a real 
			comic book
					walt
			fucking one hit wonder dimestore 
			frank millers
					stevedave
			this is the reality at comictoast  
			youre not going to get your ass 
			kissed here because both me and walt 
			think you suck
					walt
			and me
					stevedave
			i said that
	stevedave offers the boys his two middle fingers then 
	goes back to playing his game with walt  holden and 
	banky stare shocked  banky nudges holden and they both 
	exit stevedave and the fanboy slap hands and go back to 
	playing
					walt
			ive got a dragon card  forty power
			ups and twelve life points!  ha!  i 
			get your elf card!
					stevedave
			youre such a bitch!  but thankfully 
			ive saved a dark forces shaman card 
			for just such an occasion
					walt
			you suck!  eighty six lifepower 
			points to my twenty two!
					stevedave
			i schooled their asses now im 
			schooling yours
	suddenly  a trash can crashes through the front window 
	stevedave and walt hit the deck like bitches covering 
	one another  they look up slowly stevedave leaps to 
	his feet and looks at the shattered mess  he pulls 
	something off the garbage can and reads it
					walt
			you know it was those two fucks!  
			lets call the cops and have them 
			busted!  i know where their studio is!  
			or better yet lets sue!  you can sue 
			them stevedave!
					stevedave
				still reading note
			that wont be necessary
					walt
			what!  why the hell not!
					stevedave
				holds up check
			because this is a check for three 
			times what that window cost
				reading note
			dear critics  thanks for the 
			insight but like my grandmother 
			always said  fuck em if they cant 
			take a joke and break their window  
			kiss it		banky the hack 
			ps  your card game blows
					walt
			he said kiss it!

	holden mcneil and banky edwards 
	creators of bluntman and chronic beside it is a large 
	mockup of the comic book cover which features two stoner

	neighborhood drug
	dealers holden hands the book back to the fan

	int comic book convention lecture hall  day
	hooper fills the frame  he comes off like a typical pro
	black/antiwhite homeboy
					hooper
			for years in this industry whenever an 
			africanamerican character  hero or 
			villain  was introduced usually by 
			white artists and writers  they got 
			slapped with racist names that singled 
			them out as negroes black panther 
			black lightning black goliath black	
			mantra black talon black spider 
			black hand black falcon black cat
					voice from crowd
			shes white
					hooper
			she is
				beat
			well bust this  regardless
	were at a panel discussion  the room is full  five 
	creators sit at a long table their names on placards in 
	front of them  
	one of them is a very striking girl  the banner behind 
	them reads words up  minority voices in comics
					hooper
				holds up comic
			now my book whitehating coon 
			doesnt have any of that bullshit the 
			heros name is maleekwa and hes a	
			descendant of the black tribe that 
			established the first society on the 
			planet while all you european mother	
			fuckers were still hiding in caves and 
			shit all terrified of the sun hes a 
			strong role model that a young black	
			reader can look up to cause im here 
			to tell you  the chickens are comin 
			home to roost yall the black mans	
			no longer gonna play the minstrel in 
			the medium of comics and sci
			fi/fantasy!  were keeping it real 
			and were gonna get respect  
			by any means necessary!
	during the speech holden and banky enter and sit up 
	front
					holden
				calling out
			bullshit!  lando calrissian was a 
			black man and he got to fly the 
			millennium falcon!
	hooper whips his head around looking for the source of 
	the comment
					hooper
			who said that!
					holden
				standing
			i did!  lando calrissian is a positive 
			black role model in the realm of 
			science fiction/fantasy
					hooper
			fuck lando calrissian!  uncle tom 
			nigger!  always some white boy gotta 
			invoke the holy trilogy! bust this  
			those movies are about how the white 
			man keeps the brother man down  even

					hooper

			installment because vaders 
			beautiful		black visage is 
			sullied when he pulls off his mask to 
			reveal a feeble crusty white man! 
			theyre trying to tell us that deep 
			inside we all want to be white!
					banky
			well isnt that true!
	hooper explodes he pulls a nine millimeter from his 
	belt draws on banky and fires  banky goes down falling 
	forward into the crowd the crowd screams and starts to 
	scatter hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists

	always hit his never do

					alyssa

			like mad

					holden

			grandmother told me when i was a kid 
			holden she said the big bucks are 
			in dick and fart jokes  she was a 
			churchgoer

					alyssa
			uhoh  the cry from the heart of a 
			real artist trapped in commercial hell 
			 pitying his good fortune  im sure 
			you can dry your eyes on all those fat 
			checks you rake in

					holden
			im sorry  did i detect a note of 
			bitter envy in there!

					alyssa
			nope  im happy my stuff gets read at 
			all  theres very little market for 
			hearts and flowers in this spandex
			clad big pecs big tits big guns 
			field  if i sell two issues i feel 
			like john grisham

					holden
				looking out window
			its all about marketing  over or 
			underweight guys who dont get laid  
			theyre our bread and butter  people 
			like those two outside should be 
			yours

	through the window we see a couple making out on the 
	hood of a car

					holden
			and sadly there are more of our core 
			audience out there than yours
				smiles
			look at that though  kind of gives 
			you a little charge to see two people 
			in love  and all over bankys car no 
			less  that cars seeing more action 
			right now than its seen in years

					alyssa
			bubbly guy like that its hard to 
			figure out why

					holden
				still looking at oc couple
			youve gotta respect that kind of 
			display of affection  its crazy 
			rude selfabsorbed  but its love

					alyssa
			thats not love

					holden

					holden
			fleeting

					alyssa
			uhhuh  you wanna hear about love!

			all through high school he dated this 
			one girl  they  were inseparable  
			and when they graduated she went off 
			to carnegie mellon

					holden
			in pittsburgh

					alyssa
			im impressed  so he stays in the 
			home town and they begin their long
			distance relationship  the plan is 
			on the  third sunday of every month 
			hell train out spend a week then 
			train back they do this for four 
			years

					holden
			that is love

					alyssa
			not nearly finished  two months 
			before shes going to graduate hes 
			got this job digging graves and he 
			comes across

					holden
			a stiff

					alyssa
			a steamer trunk containing silver 
			ingots

					holden
			get out of here

					alyssa
			many many silver ingots  now my 
			mothers uncle being quite the 
			ingenious chap  he buries the trunk  
			again and heads up to the main office 
			where he proceeds to purchase a 
			cemetery plot  guess which one

					holden
			clever

					alyssa
			so now he owns the plot and all of its 
			contents  two  days later my 
			mothers uncle is worth three million

					holden
			at which time he marries the high 
			school sweetheart and lives happily 
			ever after

					alyssa
			not even close  inside the steamer 
			trunk stenciled into the wood or 
			something like that is a curse

					holden
			someone wrote fuck inside his new 
			steamer trunk

					alyssa
			not that kind of curse  a cryptic 
			curse great fortune means great loss 
			it said

					holden
			what kind of asshole writes that 
			inside a steamer trunk!

					alyssa
			the same kind of asshole that buries 
			silver ingots  the day my mothers 
			uncle is heading out to see the girl 
			he stops at his accountants to grab 
			some cash and winds up missing his 
			train  so he has to take the next one 
			 which he does  and he gets there an 
			hour later than his usual time of 
			arrival whereupon he sees lights

					holden
			a heros welcome for the new 
			millionaire

					alyssa
			it seems that while she was standing 
			on the platform waiting that extra 
			hour for my mothers uncle to show up 
			the girl was dragged into the bushes 
			by an unknown assailant raped and 
			gutted

	holden is silent alyssa downs her drink

					alyssa
			the assailant was never apprehended

					holden

			of his life  one day up the next day 
			back  did that till the day he died  
			he donated the fortune hed acquired 
			to the train station in pittsburgh to 
			have a welllit terminal built  
			the train line let him ride for free 
			after that

	alyssas preoccupied  she points to someone in the 
	crowd and curls her finger back in a cmere fashion

	kim exits  banky is smiling eartoear  alyssa looks at 
	him

					alyssa
			yes

					banky
			you said fuck  to that girl  you 
			said youd fuck her

					alyssa
			and

					banky
			how can a girl fuck another girl! 
			were you talking about strapons or 
			something

					holden
				hits him
			would you shut up!!

					banky
			what!!  its a valid question  you 
			know the dyke stuff in the penthouse 
			letters section is written by guys  
			this is our chance to get the inside 
			scoop

					holden
				to alyssa
			i dont know how many times i can 
			apologize for him

					alyssa
			its okay  secretly all i really 
			want is to be the center of attention
				to banky
			ive never used a snapon

					banky
			then whats with saying fuck  
			shouldnt you say eat her out or at 
			least modify the term fuck with 
			something like fist

					alyssa
			let me ask you a question  can men 
			fuck each other!

					banky
			ask hooper

					alyssa
			in your estimation

					banky
			sure

					alyssa
			so for you to fuck means to 
			penetrate  youre used to the more 
			traditional definition  you inside 
			some girl youve duped jackhammering 
			away not noticing that bored look in 
			her eyes

					banky
			hey  i always notice the bored look 
			in their eyes

					alyssa
				laughs
			fucking is nor limited to 
			penetration banky for me it 
			describes any sex when its not 
			totally about love  i dont love kim 
			but ill fuck her  im sure you dont 
			love every girl you sleep with

					banky
			some of them i downright loathe

					alyssa
			but ill bet its different with the 
			ones you love  ill bet you go the 
			full nine when its not just a quick 
			fix  like you go down on them longer 
			or something

					holden
			here we go

					banky
			i dont do that

					alyssa
			what!!

					banky
			i stopped dropping  it got to be too 
			frustrating

					holden
			as stupid as you usually come off 
			during this diatribe of yours youre 
			going to come off ten times as stupid 
			on this occasion

					banky
			what!  i lost my tolerance for the 
			bullshit baggage that comes with 
			eating girls out  whats the big 
			deal!

					alyssa
			if you say the smell so help me ill 
			slug you

					banky
			not the smell  the smell is good  
			im talking about not being able to do 
			it property  and my mother brought me 
			up to believe that if i cant do 
			something
			right i shouldnt do it at all  of 
			course my father told me she gave 
			lousy head but thats beside the 
			point

					alyssa
			at least you blame yourself for your 
			sexual inadequacies

					banky
			no i blame them  chicks never help 
			you out  they never tell you what to 
			do  and most of them are self
			conscious about that smell factor and 
			so most of the time they just lay 
			there frozen like a deer in the 
			headlights right  not for nothing 
			but when a chick goes down on me  i 
			let her know where to go and what the 
			status is  you gotta handle it like 
			cnn and the weather channel  constant 
			updates

					holden
			youre such an idiot

					alyssa
			no hes got a point  thats how i 
			was in high school  i was nervous 
			and inhibited about being eaten out  
			but by the time i got to college that 
			all changed  i loosened up  not only 
			did i learn to communicate  i learned 
			to be bossy  
			i was like one of those guys at the 
			airport with those big flash lights  
			waving them this way directing them 
			that way telling them when to stop

					banky
			and thats all im saying itd be 
			different if chicks helped out  
			pointed a guy in the right direction  
			then thered be no bullshit no wasted 
			time and no chance for permanent 
			injuries

					alyssa
			permanent injuries

					banky
			sure  you wanna see something 
			permanent!
				pulls our front tooth
			i got this from nina rollins 
			sophomore year  im going down on 
			her and out of nowhere her cat jumps 
			on her stomach  she does this big ol 
			pelvic thrust  cracks my tooth in 
			half sends it down my throat  i had 
			to get a crown for the stub

					alyssa
				to holden
			i got that beat
				to banky
			i got that beat
				halfturns and lifts chin
			sophomore year  im going down on 
			cynthia slater in her dorm room after 
			we went clubhopping  im totally 
			drunk and in the middle of it i fall 
			asleep  right there in her lap  she 
			got so mad she digs her heel into my
			back right there
				points to scar

					banky
			you see this!
				moves neck slightly right
			thats the farthest i can move my neck 
			to the right sophomore year im going 
			out with maria bennert and for six 
			months im going down on her and not 
			a damn things happening  
			then one night i change a position 
			or vary my lappingspeed and suddenly 
			its a whole new world  shes moving 
			around convulsing breathing heavy  
			and her legs are pressing against my 
			ears so tightly that i dont hear her 
			father come into the room  he grabs 
			my hair
				grabs his own hair and pulls 
				back
			and he pulls me way back hard

					alyssa
				throws up her leg and rolls 
				up pants
			senior year  spring formal  im 
			eating our missy kurt in her brothers 
			car  shes laying across the back 
			seat and im halfhanging out of the 
			car my knees on the ground  shes 
			flailing around and she knocks the 
			parking brake off  the car starts 
			rolling down the hill and my right 
			knee is cut up all to shit like a 
			kiddys scissor class cut it up for 
			paper dolls

	banky and alyssa laugh  holden looks at a small scar on 
	his arm and thinks better about mentioning it  then kim 
	reenters and plants a big kiss on alyssas neck

					holden
				off bankys watch
			holy shit is that the time  weve 
			gotta beat traffic

					banky
			what traffic  its one thirty in the 
			morning!

			and rush hour starts in six hours  
			lets go
				to alyssa
			thanks for inviting us out  it was 
			educational

	alyssa waves at him as he exits  banky slides out of the 
	booth

					banky
				to kim

			mirror all the time

	holden reaches in and pulls banky out  alyssa watches 
	them go then turns and kisses kim

	ext riverfront park  day

	alyssa and holden walk through the park eating hot dogs

					alyssa
			mtv

					holden
			twelve episodes

					alyssa
			thats great isnt it

					holden
			banky seems to think so

					alyssa
			but you dont

	they come to a swing set and sit down on the swings

					holden
			i dont know if thats the perception 
			i want people to have of our stuff  i 
			know this sounds pretentious as hell 
			but i like to think of us as artists  
			and id like to get back to doing 
			something more personal  like our 
			first book

					alyssa
			well when are you going to do that

					holden
				beat
			as soon as we have something personal 
			to say

					alyssa
			do you know how pretty you are

					holden
			what

					alyssa
			youre a pretty man

					holden
			uh thanks

					alyssa
			oh  i get it  im into girls so i 
			have to find all men repulsive or 
			something

					holden
			i didnt say anything

					alyssa
			arent there some men that you find 
			attractive  granted not enough to 
			sleep with but still  just handsome 
			or something!

					holden
			sure  harrison ford  and our mail
			man

					alyssa
			well its the same thing  i look at 
			you and just find you really handsome  
			and you know it has very little to do 
			with your look perse  your look is 
			fine dont get me wrong  but its 
			more your outlook  the things you 
			say the way you see things  its 
			i dont know attractive

	holden looks away embarrassed

					alyssa
			i weirded you our the other night

					holden
			huh!  no not really

					alyssa
			come on

					holden
				beat
			its just that weve i mean ive 
			never seen that kind of thing up close 
			and personal  it just took awhile to 
			process longer than usual

					alyssa
			do you want to talk about it!

					holden
			um  if you want to

					alyssa
			i like you  i havent liked a man in 
			a long time  and im not a manhater 
			or something  its just been some 
			time since ive been exposed to a man 
			that didnt immediately liveinto a 
			stereotype of some sort  and i want 
			you to feel comfortable with me 
			because i want us to be friends  so 
			if there are things youd like to 
			know its okay to ask me

					holden
				beat
			why girls

					alyssa
				beat
			why men

					holden
			because thats the standard

					alyssa
			if thats the only reason youre 
			attracted to women  because its the 
			standard

					holden
			its more than that

					alyssa
			so youve never been curious about 
			men

					holden
			curious about men  well i always 
			wondered why my father watched hee
			haw

					alyssa
			you know what i mean

					holden
			no

					alyssa
			why not!

					holden
			no interest

					alyssa
			because

					holden
			girls feel right

					alyssa
			and thats how i feel  ive never 
			really been attracted to men  im 
			more comfortable with the idea of 
			girls

					holden
			wait wait wait  youre still a 
			virgin

					alyssa
			no

					holden
			but youve only been with girls

					alyssa
			youre saying a persons a virgin 
			until theyve had intercourse with a 
			member of the opposite sex

					holden
			isnt that the standard definition

					alyssa
			again with the standards  i think 
			virginity is lost when you make love 
			for the first time

					holden
			with a member of the opposite sex

					alyssa
			why  why only then

					holden
			because thats the standard

					alyssa
			so if a virgin is raped then shes 
			still a virgin

					holden
			of course not

					alyssa
			but rape is not the standard  so 
			shes had sex but not the standard 
			idea of sex  hence according to  
			your definition shed still be a 
			virgin

					holden
			okay ill revise  virginity is lost 
			when the hymen is broken

					alyssa
			then i lost my virginity at ten 
			because i fell on a fence post when i 
			was ten and it broke my hymen  now i 
			have to tell people that i lost it to 
			a wooden post id known my whole young 
			life

					holden
			second revision  virginity is lost 
			through penetration

					alyssa
			physical penetration or emotional

					holden
			emotional

					alyssa
			well i fell in love hard with caitlin 
			bree when we were in high school

					holden
			physical penetration

					alyssa
			we had sex

					holden
			yeah but not real sex

					alyssa
			i move to have that remark stricken 
			from the record  on account of it 
			makes you come off as completely naive 
			and infantile

					holden
			well wheres the penetration in 
			lesbian sex

	alyssa holds up her hand

					holden
			a finger  come on  ive had my 
			finger in my ass but i wouldnt say 
			ive had anal sex

					alyssa
			did i hold up a finger
				waves her hand

					holden
				beat then he gets it
			youre kidding!!
				she nods
			how!

					alyssa
			our bodies are built to pass a child 
			for christs sake

					holden
			but doesnt it hurt!

					alyssa
			sure  but in a good way  and its 
			only a onceinawhile thing  reserved 
			for really special occasions

					holden
			what about notsospecial occasions

					alyssa
			tongue only

					holden
			but how can that be enough  i mean 
			lets be real  how big can a tongue 
			even get

	alyssa swallows what shes chewing and releases her 
	tongue which is just huge  holden is transfixed  
	alyssa wraps it back up and smiles standing

					alyssa
			lets go

	she exits holden remains in the swing  alyssa comes 
	back in

			upbringing

					alyssa
			please there was no time to be bad  
			we were too busy saying jesus

					holden
			you think your upbringing had 
			something to do with your lifestyle 
			choice

					alyssa
			somewhere along the line  its a 
			gradual transition to make  from 
			doing what the majority does to taking 
			a leap of faith and doing what feels 
			more natural  everything helps  from 
			the way you were handled as a kid to 
			the way the boys acted in third grade 
			to the shoes you wore at your freshman 
			prom

					holden
			shoes

					alyssa
			well they were really tight



	hanging out montage begins

	with the requisite music over which we hear a 
	conversation between holden and alyssa

	1 holden and alyssa sit in the diner eating  holdens 
	talking  the waitress walks past and drops her pad  she 
	bends over to pick it up hiking her miniskirt up in 
	the process  alyssa stares at her ass  holden stops 
	talking and stares at her  alyssa looks over at him and 
	offers a caught smile

	2 holden pushes a shopping cart at the food store 
	throwing various things into the basket  alyssa comes up 
	with a box of tampons and throws them in  holden glances 
	at them a bit flushed  alyssa catches him picks up the 
	box and pulls one out  she proceeds to demonstrate 
	their usage throwing one leg on the can and miming 
	insertion  holden puts up his hands in the i know i 
	know fashion

	3 in the studio holden displays some of his artwork to 
	alyssa during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes 
	to light it  its a childproof lighter so shes having 
	trouble  holden grows a little frustrated  finally he 
	grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with 
	his teeth  alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback  
	holden spits the tab out and lights alyssas smoke  he 
	then continues with his display

	4 holden and alyssa at the comic book store  stevedave 
	and the fanboy eye them suspiciously  alyssa pays for a 
	comic  stevedave glowers at holden  he gives alyssa 
	her change and they exit  stevedave goes back to his 
	card game with the fanboy  suddenly a garbage can 
	comes crashing through their window  stevedave rips a 
	check off the garbage can and punches the counter  the 
	fanboy rubs his back soothingly

	5 holden and alyssa walk through a parking lot talking  
	she takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder 
	holden smiles to himself

					holden vo

	int studio  day

	holden and banky play ea sports hockey on sega  theres 
	a knock at the door

					holden
			come in

	alyssa enters and stands besides them smiling at their 
	game

					alyssa
			i read somewhere that guys who play 
			hockey are merely making up for penile 
			deficiencies by carrying big sticks

					banky
			i thought you lived in the city  this 
			is like the umpteenth time ive seen 
			you here  isnt that grounds enough 
			for the little pink mafia to throw you 
			out of their club

					holden
				hits banky to alyssa
			ill be ready in a second  
			i just have to school this mouthy 
			secondstringer

			instead of thirty



	int skeeball arcade  day

	holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine  
	alyssa looks on

					alyssa
			explain this again

					holden
			how could you have grown up down the 
			shore and never played skeeball  
			what did you do with your youth

	they head toward the skeeball runs

					alyssa
			stayed out late smoked pot screwed 
			around

					holden
			not your grade school years your high 
			school years

					alyssa
				off skeeball run
			this looks complicated

					holden
				inserts coin and pulls 
				lever
			the premise is very basic  you roll 
			the ball up the ramp at varying 
			speeds in an effort to pop it into 
			the score circles  the higher the 
			score the more prize tickets you get

					alyssa
			what do you do with the prize tickets

					holden
			trade them in for prizes that arent 
			worth nearly as much as you paid to 
			play the game

					alyssa
			then whats the point

					holden
			its fun

					alyssa
			and you question my lifestyle

					holden
			observe

	holden rolls the ball  it pops into a twenty point 
	circle

					holden
			see  its just that simple

					alyssa
			why not just walk up there and put it 
			in the fifty every time

					holden
			wheres the skill in that

					alyssa
			oh this is a skill  im sorry i had 
			no idea

					holden
			just toss one

	alyssa picks up a ball squints to aim and whips it 
	overhand  it pops off one of the circles and shoots back 
	at them missing them as they duck  an oc knock and an 
	ow! is heard  holden reacts as alyssa laughs

					holden
				to oc guy
			im sorry man  shes new at this

	holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head  
	he gets up

					holden
				to oc
			thank you
				hands alyssa another ball
			underhand  throw it underhand

					alyssa
			this is where you take straight chicks 
			on dates

					holden
			its like spanish fly  thisll 
			probably be the first time i dont 
			score afterwards

					alyssa
			i dont know  im starting to get a 
			tingle in my bottom
				tosses a ball
			ten

					holden
				grabs a ball
			so whatd you do last night
				prepares to throw

					alyssa
			got laid

	holden whips the ball in surprise  it ricochets off the 
	ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine  
	alyssa laughs  holden looks around nervously

					alyssa
			some more of that skill you were 
			telling me about

					holden
			maybe we should just leave before 
			somebody gets hurt

					alyssa
			no way  i want a cheap prize
				throws a ball
			so your friends quite the homophobe

					holden
			he just feels left out i think

					alyssa
			im not talking about his infantile 
			hangup with me  im talking about 
			when you two were playing that game  
			everytime he swore  when his players 
			messed up he called them cocksuckers 
			he referred to the players as queers 
			he called you a cockteaser

					holden
			i thought he was talking to you

					alyssa
			i know you think it means nothing and 
			it may in fact be unintentional but 
			its ugly all the same

					holden
			he was just pissed he was losing

					alyssa
			so he slams the gay community

					holden
			cmon  dont get all pc on me

					alyssa
			im not  but what is that saying

					holden
			it says he gets too easily frustrated

					alyssa
			its passive/agressive gaybashing

					holden
			how do you figure

					alyssa
			how casually did it roll off his 
			tongue  and thats how he expresses 
			his anger  by calling people faggots

					holden
			i think youre reading too much into 
			it

					alyssa
			i think youre just so used to it that 
			it rolls off your back  ive heard 
			the two of you play your little rank 
			out game where one insists the other 
			is gay
				as the boys
			youre a faggot  no youre a 
			faggot  its cute and all to watch 
			you go at it like gradeschooler but 
			its also offensive  labeling and 
			ducking the label of being gay as if 
			it were the scarlet fucking letter

					holden
			youre blowing this way out of 
			proportion  we live in a more 
			tolerant age now  you refer to 
			yourself as a dyke  hooper calls 
			himself a faggot all the time

					alyssa
			yeah but thats whats known as 
			empowerment/disempowerment  i call 
			myself a dyke so its not too 
			devastating when some throwback 
			screams it at me as im leaving a bar 
			at night  
			same for hooper  by calling himself a 
			faggot he steals the thunder away 
			from the mouthy jerks of this world 
			whod like to beat him to it  but the 
			difference between us having it and 
			your friend saying it is miles wide  
			we say it to mask the pain  you say 
			it for lack of a better expression at 
			any given moment  no holden we do 
			not live in a more tolerant age  and 
			if you think thats the case then 
			youve been in the suburbs way too 
			long to be resuscitated

	holden kind of sulks  alyssa notices

					alyssa
			but you know what
				picks up his face
			i have more faith in you than that
				rips her tickets off
			come on  i want my cheap prize



	int studio  night

			the whalers a bunch of faggots in the 
			privacy of my own office far from the 
			sensitive ears of the rest of the 
			world

					holden
			its passive/aggressive gaybashing 
			and i know youre not really 
			prejudiced at heart  you should just 
			find some other way to express your 
			anger is all im saying

	holden starts drawing  banky stares at him  then he 
	grabs the pencil out of holdens hand and shoves him to 
	the side  he starts drawing something

					holden

					banky

			she knows youve got this schoolboy 
			crush and shes using it to sway your 
			way of thinking!

					holden
			and why would she need to do that  
			what is she mata fucking hari!  what 
			does she gain

					banky
			maybe she thinks youll get her comic 
			picked up by contender  or maybe she 
			thinks youll change the content of 
			our book to something more political 
			and message oriented  or gee  i 
			dont know  maybe because thats just 
			what dykes like to do fuck around 
			with straight guys heads just so she 
			can go back to her little rugmuncher 
			club and have a good laugh with all 
			her manhating harpy cronies about how 
			fucking stupid and easily duped men 
			are!

					holden
			youre so out of line right now

					banky

	painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield 
	making footprints

					holden
			ive always wondered what kind of 
			people buy those things  i cant 
			believe you talked him down to twenty 
			five!

					alyssa
			it was looking shakey when he told me 
			the artist was a blind cripple with a 
			humpback but i held my ground  
			theres no room for sympathy in the 
			buyers market

					holden
			where are you going to hang it

					alyssa
			im not  you are

					holden
			you want me to hang it for you  you 
			better hope it doesnt get out to the 
			girlnation that you needed a man to 
			help you hang a picture

					alyssa
			youre going to hang it in your house  
			i bought it for you

					holden
				laughs
			yeah right

					alyssa
				looks at him
			im serious

	holden stares at her

					holden
			why

					alyssa
			because its captured the moment  
			itll be a constant reminder  not 
			just of tonight but of our 
			introduction the building of our 
			friendship everything  make no 
			mistake about it my friend  its a 
			gift to you from me so youll always 
			remember us

	holden stares ahead  then he swerves the wheel to the 
	right



	ext roadside  night

	the car pulls to the side of the road  the rain is a bit 
	heavier now



	int car  night

	holden throws the car into park

					alyssa
			why are we stopping

					holden
			because i cant take it

					alyssa
			cant take what

					holden
			i love you

					alyssa
				beat
			you love me

					holden
			i love you  and not in a friendly 
			way although i think were great 
			friends  and not in a misplaced 
			affection puppydog way although im 
			sure thats what youll call it  and 
			its not because youre unattainable  
			i love you  very simple very truly  
			youre the epitome of every attribute 
			and quality ive ever looked for in 
			another person  i know you think of 
			me as just a friend and crossing that 
			line is the furthest thing from an 
			option youd ever consider  but i 
			cant do this any longer  i cant 
			stand next to you without wanting to 
			hold you  i cant look into your eyes 
			without feeling that longing you only 
			read about in trashy romance novels  
			i cant talk to you without wanting to 
			express my love for everything you 
			are  i know this will probably queer 
			our friendship  no pun intended  but 
			i had to say it because ive never 
			felt this before and i like who i am 
			because of it  and if bringing it to 
			light means we cant hang out anymore 
			then that hurts me  but i couldnt 
			allow another 	day to go by without 
			getting it out there regardless of 
			the outcome which by the look on your 
			face is to be the inevitable shoot
			down  and ill accept that but i know 
			some part of you is hesitating for a 
			moment and if there is a moment of 
			hesitation that means you feel 
			something too  all i ask is that you 
			not suppress that  at least for ten 
			minutes  and try to dwell in it 
			before you dismiss it  
			there isnt another soul on this 
			fucking planet whos ever made me the 
			person i am when im with you and i 
			would risk this friendship for the 
			chance to take it to the next plateau  
			because its there between you and me  
			you cant deny that  and even if we 
			never speak again after tonight 
			please know that im forever changed 
			because of you and what youve meant 
			to me which  while i do appreciate 
			it  id never need a painting of 
			birds bought at a diner to remind me 
			of

	int holdens bedroom night

	holden and alyssa lie in each others arms moonlight 
	bathing them  she smokes

					holden
			can i ask you something

					alyssa
			dont even tell me you want to do it 
			again

					holden
			why me  you know  why now

					alyssa
			because you were giving me that look 
			and i got wet

					holden
			you know what im talking about

					alyssa
			why not you

					holden
			im a guy  youre attracted to girls

					alyssa
			i see youve been taking notes 
			historically yes  thats true

					holden
			then why this

					alyssa
			ive given that a lot of thought you 
			know  i mean now that im being 
			ostracized by my friends ive had a 
			lot of time to think about all of 
			this  and what ive come up with is 
			really simple i came to this on my 
			terms  i didnt just heed what i was 
			taught you  know  men and women 
			should be together its the natural 
			way  that kind of thing  im not 
			with you because of what family 
			society life tried to instill in me 
			from day one  the way the world is  
			how seldom you meet that one person 
			who gets you its so rare   my 
			parents didnt really have it  there 
			was no example set for me in the world 
			of male/female relation ships  and to 
			cut oneself off from finding that 
			person  to immediately half your 
			options by eliminating the possibility 
			of finding that one person within your 
			own gender that just seemed stupid  
			so i didnt  and by leaving my 
			options open i was branded gay 
			which to me was no big deal  labels 
			are labels you know  they define 
			what you do not who you are i guess 
			but 		then you come along  you  
			the one least likely i mean you were 
			a guy

					holden
			still am

					alyssa
			and while i was falling for you i put 
			a ceiling on that because you were a 
			guy  
			until i remembered why i opened the 
			door to women in the first place  to 
			not limit the likelihood of finding 
			that one person whod compliment me so 
			completely  and so here we are i was 
			thorough when i looked for you and i 
			feel justified lying in your arms  
			because i got here on my terms and 
			have no question that there was 
			someplace i didnt look  and that 
			makes all the difference

					holden
				beat
			shit

					alyssa
			what

					holden
			well you took the luster our of it

					alyssa
			what luster

					holden
				joking  in case you didnt 
				get it
			of how i brought you back from the 
			other side  how all you needed was 
			the right man to turn you around

					alyssa
			youre not the right man
				kisses him
			youre just the one

	she snuggles into him and closes her eyes  holden stares 
	at the ceiling

					holden
			can i at least cell people that all 
			you needed was some serious deep
			dicking

	she hits him with her pillow



	the big ol fallinginlove montage begins

	1 in holdens apartment  alyssa waves in various 
	directions shaking her head accordingly  then she puts 
	up her hands to stop  cut to holden hanging the 
	picture  alyssa gave him  
	it hangs at a severely crooked angle  he looks back to 
	her and shakes his head no

	2 holden and alyssa try to play a video game  banky 
	plays as well  holden instructs her in the ways of nhl 
	96 turning her paddle rightsideup pointing at things 
	on the screen  she presses the reset button over and 
	over  banky gives holden a what the fuck look  
	alyssa sticks her tongue at him

	3 at the video store  holden picks up a disney cartoon 
	off the shelf  he goes to show if to alyssa whos 
	reading the back of anything but dick an allchick 
	porno  an old woman stares at her  holden nods to the 
	old woman and takes the tape out of alyssas hands 
	putting it back on the shelf  he ushers her away  the 
	old woman waits until theyre gone and then picks up the 
	tape herself

	4 holden carries alyssa on his shoulders through the 
	park her crotch against the back of his neck  hes 
	talking she taps him and he stops and looks up  she 
	begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face  
	he pulls her off and put her down  shes laughing  hes 
	flushed with embarrassment  the same old woman from the 
	video store passes by with her husband  holden shrugs

	5 in holdens apartment again  alyssa again with the 
	waving then putting up her hands to stop  cut to holden 
	again this time with the painting hung completely upside 
	down  he looks at it then offers her a bewildered gaze

	6 in the office banky comes to his drawing table  there 
	are penciled pages on it with a note that says hanging 
	out with alyssa today  holden  banky crumples it up 
	and throws it across the room

	7 in holdens apartment  alyssa waves this way then 
	that way then puts up her hands frantically to stop  
	she settles back against the wall a satisfied smile 
	crawling across her face and closes her eyes  we pull 
	back to reveal holden on his knees in front of her 
	eating her out no we dont see anything!

			sulking  hes having a real problem 
			with this alyssa thing

					hooper
			i think its more like bankys having 
			a problem with all things not hetero 
			right about now  and im just another 
			paradigm of said aberration

					holden
			banky does not hate gays you know 
			that

					hooper
			but i do think he is a bit homophobic  
			and this latest episode between you 
			and ms thing has tapped into that  
			in his warped perception he lost you 
			to the dark side  which is she

					holden
			you make it sound like me and him were 
			dating

					hooper
			dont kid yourself  that boy loves 
			you in a way that hes not ready to 
			deal with

					holden
				beat
			hes been digging up dirt on alyssa

					hooper
			and just what has mister angela 
			lansbury uncovered about your lady 
			fair

					holden
			he heard some bullshit story that she 
			took on two guys

					hooper
			really  well then hes barking up the 
			wrong we if he wants to split you up 
			isnt he  hes not going to make you 
			see the error of your ways by pointing 
			out how truly gay shes not
				holds up a disc
			this one

					holden
			have it
				beat
			actually its kind of gotten to me

					hooper
			how so

					holden
			bankys not known for believing 
			misinformation  hes got a pretty 
			good bullshit detector

					hooper
			so what if it is true  would that 
			bother you

					holden
			sex with multiple partners

	hooper lets our a fauxshock shriek

					holden
			at the same time

	again even louder hands slapped against his cheeks

					holden
			thanks for being so comforting

					hooper

			shouldnt but it gets to me

					hooper
			kind of gal alyssa is you dont think 
			shes been in the middle of an all 
			girl groupgrope

					holden
			you see  that doesnt bother me  but 
			the thought of her and guys uh!

					hooper
			oh holden i beg you  please dont 
			drop fifty stories in my opinion of 
			you by falling prey to that latest of 
			trendy beasts

					holden
			which is

					hooper
			lesbian chic  its ohso acceptable 
			to be a gay girl nowadays  people 
			think its cute because theyve got 
			this fool picture in their heads about 
			lipstick lesbians  like they all 
			resemble alyssa  while most of them 
			look more like you

					holden
			do i detect a little intersubculture 
			cattiness

					hooper
			gay or straight  uglys still ugly  
			and most of those boys are scary

					holden
			i thought fags were all supposed to be 
			supersupportive of one another

					hooper
			screw that all for one shit  i 
			gotta deal with being the minority in 
			the minority of the minority and 
			nobodys supporting my ass  while the 
			whole of society is fawning over girls
			ongirls here i sit  a reviled gay 
			man and to top that off  im a gay 
			black man  notoriously the most 
			swishy of the bunch

					holden
			three strikes

					hooper
			hey hey!  theres a line

	a young black kid approaches hooper holding a comic 
	book

					kid
			are you hooper x

					hooper
				in militant mode
			asalaam alaikum little brother

					kid
			could you sign my comic

					hooper
				signing comic nods to 
				holden
			see that guy there  hes the devil 
			you understand  never take your eye 
			off the man  our people took their 
			eyes off him one time and he had us 
			in chains in two shakes of his snakes 
			tail

	the kid offers holden an angry look  hooper gives him 
	back his comic

					hooper
			fight the power little g

					kid
			word is bond

	the kid leaves hooper slips back into his real voice

					hooper
			look at what i have to resort to for 
			professional respect  what is it 
			about gay men that terrifies the rest 
			of the world
				shakes his head
			as for this hangup with alyssas 
			past maybe whats really bothering 
			you is that your fragile fantasy might 
			not be true

					holden
			what do you mean

					hooper
			holden  dont even try to come off 
			like you dont know what im saying  
			men need to believe that theyre marco 
			fucking polo when it comes to sex  
			like theyre the only ones whove ever 
			explored new territory  and its hard 
			not to let them believe it  i let my 
			boys run with it for awhile  feed 
			them some of that ive never done 
			this before bullshit and let em 
			labor under the delusion that they 
			rockin my world until i cant stand 
			them anymore  then i hit em with the 
			truth  its a sick game  the world 
			would be a better place if people 
			would just accept that theres nothing 
			new under the sun and everything you 
			can do with a person has probably been 
			done long before you got there

					holden
			i can accept that

					hooper
			honey that almost sounded convincing  
			do yourself a favor  just ask her 
			about her past point blank  get it 
			out of the way before it gets too big 
			for both yall to move
				spotting something oc
			oooh!  myra breckinridge!

	hooper trots off holden glances at the disc in his 
	hands  pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks barely 
	clad making out  the title is men suck and so do

	like a geyser and two goes down hard

	holden stares at alyssa flabbergasted  the crowd around 
	them stares not at the fight on the ice but the fight in 
	their midst shocked  alyssa fumes

					holden
			excuse me!!

					alyssa
			thats what you wanted to hear isnt 
			it  isnt that what this little cross
			examination of yours is about  well

			badgering a witness
				to bystander
			am i right

					bystander
				to holden
			jeez even i knew what you were 
			getting at

					alyssa
				gathering her stuff

			true!  yeah i took on two guys at 
			once!  you want to hear some gems you 
			might not have unearthed  i took a 
			twenty six year old guy to my senior 
			prom and then left halfway through to  
			have sex with him and gwen turner in 
			the back of a limo!  and the girl who 
			got caught in the shower with miss 
			moffit the gym teacher  that was me!  
			or how about in college when i let 
			shannon hamilton videotape us having 
			sex  only to find out the next day 
			that he broadcast it on the campus 
			cable station!  theyre all true  
			those and so many more!  didnt you 
			know  im the queen of urban legend!

					holden
			how the hell could you do those 
			things!

					alyssa
			easily!  some of it i did out of 
			stupidity some of it i did out of 
			what i thought was love but  good or 
			bad  they were my choices and im 
			not making apologies for them now  
			not to you or anyone!  and how dare 
			you try to lay a guilt trip on me 
			about it  in public no less!  who 
			the fuck do you think you are you 
			judgemental prick!

					holden
			how am i supposed to feel about all of 
			this

					alyssa

			wouldve let it happen if i hadnt 
			wanted it to do you!  i was an 
			experimental girl for christs sake! 
			maybe you knew early on that your 
			track was from point a to b  but 
			unlike you i wasnt given a fucking 
			map at birth so i tried it all!  that 
			is until we  thats you and i  got 
			together and suddenly i was sated  
			cant you take some fucking comfort in 
			that  you turned out to be all i was 
			ever looking for  the missing piece 
			in the big fucking puzzle!
				tries to calm down
			look im sorry i let you believe that 
			you were the only guy id ever been 
			with  i shouldve been more honest  
			but it seemed to make you feel special 
			in a way that me telling you over and 
			over again how incredible you are 
			would never get across

	she touches his face  he pulls back  she stares at him 
	hurt and pissed

					alyssa
			do you mean to tell me that  while 
			you have zero problem with me sleeping 
			with half the women in new york city  
			you have some sort of halfassed 
			mealymouthed objection to pubescent 
			antics that took place almost ten 
			years ago  what the fuck is your 
			problem!

	holdens eyes are downcast  alyssa waits for a response

	exit jay and silent bob  holden remains in the booth 
	thinking



	montage  an uncomfortable silence

	1 holden sits at his drawing table tapping his pencil 
	up and down

	2alyssa sits in a club getting talked at by some women 
	shes not present in the conversation

	3 banky meets with sloss at a restaurant sloss shakes 
	the contracts at him and banky makes the i know i 
	know face

	4 holden stares at the picture alyssa gave him

	5 alyssa with her ear to the phone  she hangs up 
	angrily

	6 holden sits in the park that he and alyssa walked 
	through  hes staring at alyssas yearbook picture  he 
	closes the book and sighs  then an idea hits him  he 
	jumps up and dashes out of the park



	int studio  night

	banky and alyssa sit on the couch  holden paces in front 
	of them

					holden
			i know youre wondering why i asked 
			you both here tonight at the same 
			time knowing that we have shit to 
			settle between us separately

					banky
			i just figured you wanted to kill two 
			birds with one stone by telling her to 
			fuck off with me here so you didnt 
			have to go through the story again 
			later on

					alyssa
			fuck you

					banky
			not even if you let me videotape it

					holden
			enough!
				they both look at him
			ive been going through things over 
			and over  and i dissected it all and 
			looked at it a thousand different 
			ways  banky  theres friction 
			between us for the first time in our 
			lives  you hate me dating alyssa and 
			you want me to sign off on this mtv 
			thing

					banky
			how perceptive

					holden
			alyssa  you and i hit a wall because 
			i dont know how to deal with your 
			past i guess

					banky
			thats a nice way of putting it  id 
			have said the whole doublestuff 
			thing

					holden
				right in his face
			im only going to say it once shut 
			up
				back to pacing
			now  i know im to blame one way or 
			the other on both accounts  with you 
			alyssa  its my fault because i feel 
			inadequate  because youve had so 
			much experience had such a big life 
			and my lifes been pretty small in 
			comparison

					alyssa
			that doesnt matter to me

					holden
			please  i have to get through this
				beat
			and with you banky  i know why youre 
			having such a hard time with alyssa 
			and its something thats been obvious 
			forever but i guess i just didnt 
			acknowledge it
				takes a deep breath
			youre in love with me

					banky
				makes a face beat
			what

					holden
			youre attracted to me  just as in a 
			way im attracted to you  i mean it 
			makes sense  weve been together so 
			long we have so much in common

					banky
				getting up
			well ive got to get home and catch 
			the last few minutes of babylon 5 
			so ill be

	holden grabs him kisses him full on the lips and pushes 
	him back onto the couch alyssa reacts  banky  wideeyed 
	and speechless  looks away

					holden
			its something youre going to have to 
			deal with  bank  you may very well 
			be gay which explains your homophobia 
			and why youre so jealous of alyssa 
			and your sense of humor as well

					banky
			just cause a guys got a predilection 
			coward dick jokes

					holden
			bank  stop  deal with it  youll 
			feel much better

	he grabs a chair from the side of the room

					holden
			now  at this point you may be asking 
			yourself the question that ive been 
			going over and over in my head for the 
			last few days what does one have to 
			do with the other

	alyssas face drops  she subtly shakes her head

					alyssa
				under her breath
			dont

					holden
			and when i did some serious soul
			searching it came at me from out of 
			nowhere and suddenly it all made 
			sense  a calm came over me  i know 
			what we have to do  and then you  
			bank you alyssa and i  all of us 
			can finally be alright

					alyssa
				again under her breath
			please dont say it

					holden
				sits in the chair takes a 
				long beat
			weve all got to have sex together

	the room is silent  holden lights a cigarette  bankys 
	eyes nearly bug   alyssas  head drops

					holden
			dont you see  that would take care 
			of everything  alyssa  i wouldnt 
			feel inadequate or too conservative 
			anymore  ill have done something on 
			par with all the experience youve 
			had  and itll be with you whichll 
			make it that much more powerful  and 
			banky  you can cake that leap that 
			everyone else but you sees that you 
			should take  and itll be okay 
			because itll be with me  your best 
			friend for years  weve been 
			everything to each other but 
			intimates  and now well have been 
			through that together too  and it 
			wont have to be a total leap for you 
			because a woman will be involved  and 
			when its over all that aggression 
			you feel toward alyssa will be gone  
			because youll have shared in 
			something beautiful with the woman i 
			love  itll be cathartic  a true 
			communion  we have to do this  for 
			me for both of you for all of our 
			sakes  this will keep us together
				beat
			what do you say

	banky stares forward wideeyed  he leans back into the 
	couch and lets out a huge sigh  then shrugs

					banky
			sure

	holden smiles at his friend  then he looks at alyssa

					holden
			you know i need this  you know itll 
			help

	alyssa looks at him sadly

					alyssa
			no

	holden reacts shocked banky lets out a sigh of relief

					holden
			no  i i thought youd be into 
			this

					alyssa
			you did  what does that say about me

					holden
			but youve youve done stuff 
			like this  this should be no big deal 
			for you

					alyssa
			you dont want this
				lights her cigarette
			you really dont want this  trust me

					holden
			i need this  this has to happen  why 
			cant you see that  and how can you 
			not  what does that say about me  
			you can take it from two guys whose 
			names you can barely remember but i 
			ask you to share an experience like it 
			 where its about intimacy  and you 
			say no

					alyssa
				inhales from her cigarette 
				takes a beat
			i cant

	holden moves to her side of the couch

					holden
			you can  ill be there  and when 
			its over well be the strongest 
			weve ever been because we got through 
			some nasty shit together  and well 
			finally be on the same level together  
			and then therell be nothing we cant 
			accomplish

	a tear rolls down her cheek she looks at him sadly and 
	touches his face

					alyssa
			oh holden
				trying to compose herself
			that time is over for me  ive been 
			there  ive done it  and i didnt 
			find what i was looking for in any of 
			it  i found that in you  in us  
			doing this wont help you forget about 
			the things youre hung up on  itll 
			create more

					holden
			no it wont  i thought about all of 
			that

					alyssa
			no it will  maybe youll see me 
			differently from then on  maybe 
			youll despise me for going along with 
			it once youre in the moment  maybe 
			ill moan differently and then youll 
			resent banky and become suspicious of 
			us  or youll alienate him because of 
			it and then grow to blame and hate me 
			for the deterioration of your 
			friendship  or what if i sincerely 
			doubt it but what if  i saw 
			something in banky that i never saw 
			before and fell in love with him and 
			left you  ive been down roads like 
			this before many times  i know you 
			feel doing this will broaden your 
			horizons and give you experience  but 
			ive had those experiences on my own  
			i cant accompany you on yours  im 
			past that now
				touches his face stares to 
				cry
			or maybe i just love you too much  
			and i feel hurt and let down that 
			youd want to share me with anyone  
			because i never wanted to share you
				holds it in gets up
			regardless i cant be a part of this
				beat
			or you  not anymore
				hugs him
			i love you  i always will  know 
			that

	she releases him then slaps him

					alyssa

	alyssa storms away stopping briefly to look banky up and 
	down

	banky sits at his own signing table  behind him hangs a 
	banner that reads banky edwards  creator of baby dave  
	a small line is formed in front of him  he talks with a 
	fan

	banky locks eyes with someone oc  his expression 
	softens

	holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room  
	he smiles at banky  banky smiles back and sort of nods

	holden holds up a copy of bankys new solo comic  he 
	points to it and gives a thumbs up

	and points to it   holden looks in the same direction 
	and then looks back at banky and nods

					oc fan
			you dont need that guy anyway  you 
			do great stuff without him

	banky looks at holden for a beat  then he brings his 
	pointer fingers together  mimicing holdens shared 
	moment gesture

	holden shrugs slightly then crosses his fingers  as if 
	to say hopefully

					oc fan
			you were just carrying that guy 
			anyway

	banky sort of smiles at the oc holden  then he offers 
	his own thumbs up  as to say good luck
