                                ****************

        int tyrell corporation locker room  day               1

        the eye                                                 2

        its magnified and deeply revealed  flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue  icy filaments
        surround the undulating center

        the eye is brown in a tiny screen  on the metallic
        surface below the words voightkampff are finely
        etched  theres a touchlight panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris

        the instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men  the man talking is big
        looks like an overstuffed kid  leon it says on
        his breast pocket  hes dressed in a warehousemans
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap  despite the obvious heat he looks very cool

        the man facing him is lean hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray  detached and efficient he looks like a cop
        or an accountant  his name is holden and hes all
        business except for the sweat on his face

        the room is large and humid  rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls  two large fans
        whir above their heads

                                leon
                  okay if i talk

        holden doesnt answer  hes centering leons eye on
        the machine

                                leon
                  i kinda get nervous when i
                  take tests

                                holden
                  dont move

                                leon
                  sorry

        he tries not to move but finally his lips cant help
        a sheepish smile

                                leon
                  already had iq test this year 
                  but i dont think i never had a

                                holden
                         cutting in
                  reaction time is a factor in this
                  so please pay attention  answer
                  quickly as you can

        leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly
        holdens voice is cold geared to intimidate and evoke
        response

                                holden
                  youre in a desert walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a

                                leon
                  what one

        it was a timid interruption hardly audible

                                holden
                  what

                                leon
                  what desert

                                holden
                  doesnt make any difference what
                  desert  its completely
                  hypothetical

                                leon
                  but how come id be there

                                holden
                  maybe youre fed up maybe you
                  want to be by yourself  who
                  knows  so you look down and
                  see a tortoise  its crawling
                  towards you

                                leon
                  a tortoise  whats that

                                holden
                  know what a turtle is

                                leon
                  of course

                                holden
                  same thing

                                leon
                  i never seen a turtle

        he sees holdens patience is wearing thin

                                leon
                  but i understand what you mean

                                holden
                  you reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back leon

        keeping an eye on his subject holden notes the dials
        in the voightkampff  one of the needles quivers
        slightly

                                leon
                  you make these questions mr
                  holden or they write em down
                  for you

        disregarding the question holden continues picking
        up the pace

                                holden
                  the tortoise lays on its back
                  its belly baking in the hot sun
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over  but it cant  not
                  without your help  but youre
                  not helping

        leons upper lip is quivering

                                leon
                  whatcha mean im not helping

                                holden
                  i mean youre not helping!
                  why is that leon

        leon looks shocked surprised  but the needles in
        the computer barely move  holden goes for the inside
        of his coat  but big leon is faster  his laser burns
        a hole the size of a nickel through holdens stomach
        unlike a bullet a laser causes no impact  it goes
        through holdens spine and comes out his back clean
        as a whistle  like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up  by the time he hits the
        floor big slow leon is already walking away  but he
        stops turns and with a little smile of satisfaction
        fires at the machine on the table

        theres a flash and a puff of smoke  the voightkampff
        is hit dead center crippled but not destroyed as
        leon walks out of the room one of its lights begins
        to blink faint but steady

        the horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end of the beginning of a day

        the train that follows cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour

        no clickittyclack of trackbound noise its a long
        insulated pullman of contoured seats and lowkeyed
        lighting coloured to sootheand empty except for
        the passenger half way down

        his eyes closed head rested against the glass  ten
        years ago deckard might have been an athlete a
        track man or a welterweight  the body looks it but
        the face has seen some time  not all of it good

        int train  refreshment dispenser  night              5

        deckard comes down the aisle slips a coin into the
        mechanism receives a beer and returns to his seat

        int train  night                                      6

        tired of the program he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window  runs a
        hand over his face it could use a shave  he leans
        closer and peers through the glass

        out there in the black a sign flashes past  san
        angeles three minutes

        ext platform  night                                   7

        the train slides in smooth as an eel and stops with
        out a sound  carrying a bag and umbrella deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night

        int corridor  night                                   8

        deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder his
        shirt already damp as he walks down the long hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light

        ext terminal  night                                   9

        deckard unlocks his car and gets in  turns the ig
        nition and hits a sensor  the dash console glows
        and deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off

                                deckard vo
                  it was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement  not bad
                  if youre a lizard  but two hours
                  earlier i was drinking acquavit
                  with an eskimo lady in north east
                  alaska  thats a tough change to
                  make  it was so good i didnt
                  want to leave so i left a day
                  early

        a little detached deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes
        sages flash across the viewer stating date time and
        caller  the last one is repeated five times  deckard
        sighs switches off the viewer and gets on the radio

                                deckard
                  contact  this is blade runner one
                  calling comfast 27

        the sound of a chime precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers

                                voice
                  blade runner one stand by please

        a pause  followed by a husky male voice

                                voice
                  deckard

                                deckard

                  ill see you in a minute

        the engine revs the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and deckard jams out of the lot

        int the hall of justice  night                        10

        an enormous grey vault of a building  a businesslike
        deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief
        case and police id pinned to his coat

                                deckard vo
                  ix4pd referred to as a nexus6
                  the tyrell corporations new pride
                  and joy  holden was administering
                  the voightkampff test when one
                  nailed him

        the door in front of deckard slides open and he walks
        through

                                deckard vo
                  the nexus6 must be fast because
                  holden was as quick as they come
                  the report said there were six of
                  them  three males and three female
                  led by a combat model called roy
                  batty

        int inspector bryants office  night                  11

        the inspector is in his fifties  the deep creases in
        his face the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler spoiler drinker but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else  bryants kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it  deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the printout

                                deckard vo
                  they escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago  killed twenty
                  three people and jumped a shuttle
                  an aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert  no crew

        bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey

                                deckard vo
                  bryants got a liver problem  a
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man  i been drinking
                  for him ever since

        deckard sets down the report and takes the shot bryant
        just poured for him

                                deckard
                  six huh

                                bryant
                  five  three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  tyrell corporation  killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  genetic sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro
                  field

                                deckard
                  what was he after

                                bryant
                  there wasnt much left of him
                  so we cant be sure  but bio
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the nexus6 were reported
                  missing  going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send holden in to run voightkampff
                  tests on the new employees  guess
                  he found himself one

        a grim pause

                                deckard
                  you got a machine on it yet

                                bryant
                  were using esper  a 231  that
                  picked up holdens alarm  its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city

                                deckard
                  where do we start

        bryants back at the safe locking up his bottle

                                bryant
                  the tyrell corporation has a
                  demo model  check it out on the
                  voightkampff  theres a chance
                  the nexus6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect  if thats the case
                  everybodys up shit creek

                                deckard
                  what was the cover on the one that
                  got holden

                                bryant
                  industrial refuse

                                deckard
                  garbage man

        bryant nods

                                deckard
                  did personnel have an address on
                  him

        bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket
        copies down a number and hands it over

                                deckard
                  ill go take a look

        deckard stands and holds up his drink

                                deckard
                  thanks

        like a sick boy looking out of the window bryant
        watches deckard down the whiskey  deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave

                                deckard vo

        as two old men clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house

        he turns into an alcove  he stops in front of a door
        that says manager and pushes the buzzer  its opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip  deckard flashes his id and speaks some words

        nothing a show box on the floor  he stoops takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care
        fully traces it over the box  assured of its harm
        lessness he lifts off the lid

        it contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band  deckard removes them goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on

        eyes are shrewd and chinese but the rest of him
        looks like a charles dickens invention

        over a lamp squinting at something in his hand  after
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour belligerent
        smile

        to remove chew holds the eye up to the light and

        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer  the back of the eye is touched with

        the object of his concentration is a mazelike chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail but magnified
        under the scope it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city  the needlelike sensor probe moves care
        fully over the contours of the configuration testing
        the bonds

        suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures

                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory  but emigrants needed
                  incentive  overpopulation and
                  the greenhouse factor didnt seem
                  to be enough but owning a human
                  lookalike had lots of appeal
                  it was big industry the competition
                  was stiff and tyrell was top of the

                  bitching about equal rights for

        the guard hands deckard back his id pushed a button

                  old supply and demand  the
                  government needed them industry
                  made them and the church backed

                  could make people im not religious

        the elevator door slides open  the young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff hair blowing in
        the wind looking out to sea in a 19th century painting

                  it seems your department doesnt
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit

                  not our problem

                                 rachael
                  but because your department cant
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large
                  its a problem  correct mr

        they pass into a canopied airfiltered corridor
        deckard doesnt answer the question because hes looking
        at the animals  small northern animals in neat en
        vironmental cages  he looks at the rabbit the raccoon
        and the squirrel but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him  the armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them

                                rachael
                  you like our owl

        its yellow eyes and blinks at them

                                deckard
                  its artificial

                                rachael
                  of course not

        hands thrust in her pockets she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back

        the exit is another tube  just big enough for two  no
        room for excess  he tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare

                                rachael
                  youre in a very unique position
                  mr deckard  you could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your

                                deckard
                  why should i be

                                rachael
                  for the responsibility of your
                  power  being a police bureaucrat
                  youve got more than your share

        the door slides open  deckard looks down at her

                                deckard
                  you got it wrong girl  i work
                  with the bureau not for them

        he lets it sink in

                  my job isnt to detect

        watch  the only sound is the insidious perking of coffee
        brewing in the background

        tyrell taps a sensor on his desk  the door in front of
        deckard and rachael slides open  they enter a vestibule
        and face another door this one befitting the decor of
        the office tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter

                                rachael
                  mr deckard  dr eldon tyrell

                                tyrell
                  how do you do mr deckard  please
                  sit down  would you care for a cup
                  of coffee

                                deckard
                  thanks

                                tyrell
                  black

                                deckard
                  please

        tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to deckard  the congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth  dragon warmth

                                tyrell
                  somehow i didnt expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work  here you are mr deckard

        he hands deckard a cup of coffee

                                tyrell
                  is this to be an empathy test

                                deckard
                  yes

                                tyrell
                  capillary dilation of the socalled
                  blush response  plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris

        deckard nods

                                tyrell
                  may i ask a personal question

                                deckard
                  go ahead

                                tyrell
                  have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake

                                deckard
                  no

                                tyrell
                  but in your profession that is a
                  risk

                                deckard
                  nothing is infallible but so far
                  the voightkampff scale bas been
                  foolproof

                                tyrell
                  like you said mr deckard a
                  machine can be a hazard  the
                  voightkampff scale is a machine
                  isnt it

                                deckard
                  one that relies on human
                  interpretation  wheres the
                  subject

                                tyrell
                  sitting next to you

        deckard stares at rachael then back at tyrell  delighted
        tyrell takes a cup of coffee

        accepting the challenge deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus

        the voightkampff                                       35

        rachaels eye fills the screen the iris brilliant shot
        with light the pupil contracting

                                deckards voice
                  ready

                                rachael
                  go ahead

        in the soft green glow of the dials the needles in both
        gauges are at rest  dr tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        deckard who sits in front of rachael a pencil beam
        trained on her eye  wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks

                                deckard
                  youre given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday

        the needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red then subside

                                rachael
                  i wouldnt accept it  also id
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police

                                deckard
                  you have a little boy  he shows
                  you his butterfly collection plus
                  the killing jar

        again the gauges register but not so far

                                rachael
                  id take him to the doctor

                                deckard
                  youre watching tv and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist

                                rachael
                  id kill it

        both needles go to red  deckard makes a note takes a
        sip of coffee and continues

                                deckard
                  in a magazine you come across a
                  fullpage photo of a nude girl

                                rachael
                  is this testing whether im an
                  android or a lesbian

                                deckard
                  you show the picture to your husband
                  he likes it and hangs it on the wall
                  the girl is lying on a bearskin rug

                                rachel
                  i wouldnt let him

                                deckard
                  why not

                                rachael
                  i should be enough for him

        deckard frowns then smiles  his smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around

                                deckard
                  you become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend
                  and you decide to get an abortion

                                rachael
                  id never get an abortion

                                deckard
                  why not

                                rachael
                  that would be murder mr deckard

                                deckard
                  in your opinion

                                rachael
                  it would be my child

                                deckard
                  sounds like you speaks from
                  experience

        he notes the needles  one goes green and the other
        remains inert

                                deckard
                  last question  youre watching
                  an old movie  it shows a banquet in
                  progress the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters

                                rachael
                  ugh

        both needles swing swiftly

                                deckard
                  the entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice

        needles move less

                                deckard
                  the raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog

        deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam

                                deckard
                  lights please

        the lights come on

                                tyrell
                  well

                                deckard
                  if she is the machine works

                                tyrell
                  the machine works  she is

        rachael sits very still  except her eyes  they go to
        tyrell and hang on  he stares back at her as he speaks

                                tyrell
                  how many questions did it take

                                deckard
                  thirteen

        rachael sits rigidly in her chair as the ground crumbles
        around her her big mermaid eyes locked with tyrell
        his voice is quiet and strong mesmerizing  shes hang
        ing by a thread

        deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth

                                deckard
                  she didnt know

                                tyrell
                  memory implant  she was programmed
                  but i think she has transcended
                  her conditioning  i think she was
                  beginning to suspect

        rachael nods fixedly  careful not to let go her grasp

                                tyrell
                  how many questions does it usually
                  take mr deckard

                                deckard
                  five maybe six

        slowly carefully tyrell unlocks his gaze from rachael
        and turns towards deckard who is starting to put away
        his equipment

                                tyrell
                  youre going to have to be on your
                  toes my friend

        deckard glances back at him

                                tyrell
                  its a complex problem and we
                  wouldnt want anything to happen
                  to you

        less of a man might shrink at the end of deckards look
        but not tyrell

                                tyrell
                  for the good of all i recommend
                  you take rachael with you
                  considering her uniqueness im
                  sure she could prove quite helpful

        deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of tyrells
        style  he turns away and starts packing up the voight
        kampff

                                deckard
                  no thanks

        deckard is ready to go

                                tyrell
                  and how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground

                                deckard
                  discreetly

                                tyrell
                  all pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer an esper 231  i
                  believe  and a photo overlay
                  packet is being produced

        deckard opens the door

                                tyrell
                  mr deckard i think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer

        rachael sits there very pale and expressionless her
        feet flat on the floor alone is the word

        trying to keep the fury out of it deckards voice
        comes out in a whisper

                                deckard
                  i work alone

        on the last word rachael glances up at him and deckard
        turns away the outer door slides open and he goes
        through it

        int tunnel  night                                     36

        as seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage dusenberg  the headlights cut through the
        dark illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road  a
        downgrade

        a sign slides by stating  caution curves ahead
        good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left

        the steady hum of the engine and the hiss of the tires
        will remain but the location suddenly changes to

        int room  night                                       37

        a pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm  the
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug
        her back to the viewer  as she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch exposing her beautiful ass an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired male
        voice intercedes

                                voice
                  lets keep our eyes on the road
                  deckard

                                deckards voice
                  sorry

        abruptly the view flashes back to

        int tunnel  night                                     38

        the moon is up there slicing through the trees strobing
        over the hood of the car  the road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper  rags of mist skim by as the
        dusenberg picks up speed  it is becoming a riveting
        ride but the passengers mind moves elsewhere

        ext woods  day                                        39

        swift soft clouds overhead  in the cold shine of
        the icy lightthe viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light and underfoot the crisp bluewhite snow
        melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth

                                voice
                  come on stay with the machine

        int tunnel  night                                     40

        the dusenberg is going faster now headlights eating
        up the road  rushing the corners in gut wrenching four
        wheel drifts  not a pleasant sensation if you dont
        like rollercoasters

        the dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend

        good place for a breather but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on

        ext lake  day                                         41

        cold and gray  the current running strong  the nose
        of a kayak points through the swells the viewer paddling
        for the shore

        this is cold remote country wild and untouched  a sky
        bluer than the madonnas cloak  the kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp

                                voice
                  were going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you dont stay
                  with me deckard  concentrate

                  how do you know im not

                                voice
                  youre not responding to the
                  stimulus  i can see right here
                  im not getting a reading

                                deckards voice
                  im tired of this

                                voice
                  almost through

        int tunnel  night                                     42

        in the dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen
        ger his specterlike face obscured by shadow but by
        the glint of teeth he must have just smiled  and the
        passengers view snaps back to the road

        suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach
        ing bend  large ones of a bus or a truck  blinding

        the dusenberg is going too fast to stop  no room to
        pass  horns blast  the dusenberg brakes goes into a
        broadside skid  the hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash  brakes locked tires
        screaming skidding  the dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space  the last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo  silence

        int doctor wheelers office  afternoon                43

        the good doctor is bending over his glasstop desk which
        resembles a pinball machine  displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        readouts indicating the results of the test

        deckard detached the patches from his forehead which
        it a little damp but other than that he looks no
        worse for wear stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctors desk

                                deckard

        dr wheeler is a thin boney man aloof but a promise

                  during the road test

                                wheeler

                  work that could be unhealthy

                                deckard
                  true

        wheeler studies his desk for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating deckards simple
        statistics

                                wheeler

        deckard bends over slipping on his shoes  wheeler looks
        up concerned

                  but you havent put in for
                  emigration

                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but i still rather be

                                deckard

                  never been more sure of anything
                  in my life

        deckard is ready to go  looking at wheeler a little
        touched with his concern

                                deckard
                  why didnt you go

                                wheeler
                  too old

                                deckard
                  but if you could

        wheeler considers it a moment smiles and shakes his head

                                wheeler
                  my job is here

                                deckard

        they shake hands and deckard walks

        int sebastians apartment  late afternoon             44

        the referee is bouncing around the ring trying to keep
        up with the two mexican lightweights pounding the shit
        out of each other  if not for the fuzz and the silence
        the audio on the holoscope is off you might think
        you were ringside at the garden  its a good fight but
        pris isnt watching

        shes got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails  the room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish  she starts on her fourth toe when a noise
        form above stops her

        it sounded like a creaking of a floor but so quiet
        sudden and over so fast its hard to be sure  she
        stares at the ceiling a moment then glances at
        sebastian

        on the other side of the room in his own world
        sebastian is peering into his magnifier soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser

        pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her  if the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing theyd
        be the only ones in the room who did

        int corridor  sebastians apartment  late after     45
        noon

        pris moving smoothly past the doors some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay

        int fire stairs  sebastians apartment  late after  46
        noon

        the gloom in here is like the light of the empty well
        her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence

        int the floor above sebastians apartment  late       47
        afternoon

        shes running now down the hall stops at the apart
        ment directly above sebastians and opens the door

        int apartment above sebastians apartment  late       48
        afternoon

        mary turns her head as pris comes in  shes sitting in
        a chair  the only piece of furniture in the room
        its broken and tilts at a funny angle  she nods and
        pris nods back

        batty is lying on his back rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like hes soothing a stiff neck

                                batty
                  whats going on down there

                                pris
                  hes not ready yet

                                batty
                  when

                                pris
                  tomorrow he says

        batty nods he cant wait  pris glances at mary and
        gives a frigid little smile  pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her  batty blows air through his
        nostrils  like an animal

        ext deckards car  freeway  night                    49

        the sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk
        prisms of light flash over the sheen of deckards car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off
        ramp curve

        ext/int car  streets  night                         50

        moving through the dark city streets  deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long steep hill

        ext street  deckards apartment  night               51

        at the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a highrise

        int corridor deckards apartment  night               52

        hes coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door  its
        riddled with locks  he slips a small device out of
        his pocket aims it at the door and the locks unlock
        the bolts slide open  he walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him

        int deckards apartment  night                        53

        he slips on the light and crosses the front room
        deckard is a pack rat  hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out

        as he enters the kitchen the sound of somebody behind
        him causes him to whirl around fast hand snapped out
        in front of him gun already in it  rachael almost got
        shot  but shes unruffled a little pale maybe but
        direct as ever  theres a long chilly moment then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor

                                rachael
                  was that your dinner

        deckard looks down at the overturned plate and nods

                                rachael
                  im sorry  i called and found out
                  you were on your way home  these
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but i thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible

        shes holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack  but its taking deckards adrenalin time to
        recede

                                rachael
                  its the nexus information you
                  wanted

        he takes the cassette but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily
        he doesnt even want to ask

                                deckard
                  thanks

        he realizes hes still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and theyre left staring
        at each other  the situation makes awkward silence
        at least for him  shes looking at him like shes
        got something to say but isnt saying it

                                deckard
                  is there anything else

                                rachael
                  i know you think it complicates
                  your work but im here to help

                                deckard
                  ive already got more help than
                  i need

                                rachael
                  i think you need more help than
                  youve got

        he doesnt but shes not backing off

                                rachael
                  theres two reasons a man rejects
                  help  either because hes so good
                  at what he does he doesnt think
                  he needs it or hes so insecure
                  he cant admit it

                                deckard
                  sounds like im an asshole either
                  way but the answer is still no

                                rachael
                  two of us might be more effective
                  than one

                                deckard
                  i work alone

        she smiles

                                rachael
                  no you dont

        she lets it sink in

                                rachael
                  you use your equipment dont you

                                deckard
                  so

                                rachael
                  so im a piece of equipment
                  use me

        its a strong look that passes between them  a long
        one  maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but

        deckards eyes follow her down as rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug put
        ting it back on the plate

                                deckard
                  thats okay ill get it

        he bends down to help but shes already done it
        their heads a few inches apart  something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more

                                rachael
                  do i make you nervous

                                deckard
                  yeah

                                rachael
                  im sorry

        and she is  and suddenly he is too  she hands him the
        plate and they stand  shes looking at the floor
        almost shy then she looks up and hes watching her
        she says it plain and simple

                                rachael
                  its strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone elses
                  fabrication

        deckard nods  he feels it but doesnt know what to
        do about it

                                deckard
                  i can imagine

                                rachael
                  can you  i couldnt

        these are not some of deckards finer moments  but she
        doesnt seem to notice

                                rachael
                  a part of me is glad  i think i
                  feel more  i dont like who i was
                  before

        deckard nods waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen

        in the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate but things have
        piled up on him in here  he contemplates the refrig
        erator

                                deckard
                  so why do you think they were
                  after their records

        hes a lot more comfortable talking shop

                                rachael
                  they probably want to find out
                  when they were made

                                deckard
                  right

        he dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out
        shes writing something on a card

                                rachael
                  i guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know youre not
                  made to last

        no way he can keep his foot out of it  she looks up and
        hands him the card

                                rachael
                  thats my number  if you need me

        she goes to the door opens it but hesitates before
        going through

                                rachael
                  you better get better locks 
                  if you want to keep me out

        she looks back at him and smiles  the smile says
        shes talking about all kinds of locks  deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay but

                                rachael
                  good night

        and shes gone

                                deckard
                  night

        he looks down at the number  its the back side of a
        snapshot   he turns it over  the picture of a man
        and a woman  the little girl between them looks like
        a sixyear old rachael

        int deckards apartment  night                        54

        hes sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of nexus sixes at they appear blankfaced hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor

        the overlay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes hair moustaches teeth eye colors
        age youth hats glasses etc  all in rapid succession
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful

                                deckard vo
                  the possibilities were infinite
                  they could change their appearances
                  but not their future
                  like she said it was short
                  longevity is what they were after
                  the garbage man even wanted a past
                  poor fuck  id check it out but
                  i knew she was right  the market
                  worked on turnover  builtin
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game  that meant her too  it
                  was something i didnt want to
                  think about

        on top of the monitor theres an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it  deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the phone rings

                                deckard
                  yeah

                                bryant

                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants espers concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  tyrells got is the entertainment
                  section  you better get on it

                                deckard
                  youd be surprised what a guyll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body

                                salome
                  i bet i would

                                deckard
                  little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress

        and to his amazement he actually spots one  its down
        low on the wall  not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he cant resist

                                salome
                  and what if somebody did try to
                  exploit me  who do i go to

        through the hole deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs

                                deckard
                  me

                                salome
                  and who do i go to about you

        he looks back  shes some out of the shower dripping
        nude  shes taken off her black wig  her hair is
        short and blonde

        deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit
        he stares at her a moment too long

                                deckard
                  hmmmmm

        deckard grins and she returns it

        she takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body  the snake noses through the cosmetics tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress  absently
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs

                                zhora
                  you ever get the feeling things
                  arent the way they seem

        her hand closes around the snakes head  deckard sees
        it coming but cant move fast enough  she strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet  before he hits the
        floor she kicks him in the stomach  the snake whistles
        through the air again as deckard rolls out of the way
        it slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor
        he goes for his laser but shes already out the door

        int passageway  night                                 65

        deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall  he sprints after
        her arrives at the door and flings it open  black
        ness  the sound of her high heels clatter down the
        metal steps

        ext street  opera house  night                       66

        its raining heavily

        the front of the opera house is open only to foot traf
        fic these days  a bizarre place on a friday night
        hawkers and whores the rabble the poor and the cur
        ious mill around the randybuilt platforms and brightly
        lit stands   zhora in just a raincoat is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere  trying not to
        run she slices through the mob as quickly as she can
        deckard is not far behind dodging and sidestepping
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter

        she comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street  she glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians  all three go down

        deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get
        ting to her feet  she sees him and runs  the two ped
        estrians are in his line of fire  he runs past them
        and drops to one knee leveling his laser

                                deckard
                  stop or youre dead!

        she doesnt  the beam flashes through the air but
        shes already around the corner

        with his bottom lip between his teeth it hurts to move
        so fast deckard jacklegs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming  it screeches to a
        stop  deckard scrambles for the door but the guy be
        hind the wheel has other ideas  he peels out fast

        the next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him  deckard goes for the door and before the old ma
        tron inside can lock it deckards yanked it open and
        jumps in  she screams as he pushes her into the pas
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face  the lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door

        deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street  its long and its empty and its going by fast
        nothing the old lady cares to see  shes got her hands
        over her eyes whimpering hoping shell faint before
        she dies

        deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over  as the car bounces off the curb he floors it

        zhoras a hundred yards ahead halfway down the street
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall  shes
        running fast but the car is faster

        as he passes her deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet  the door flies open and he
        rolls out firing

        zhoras ducking it with no where to go except

        the showcase window on her left explodes as she crashes
        through

        its a corner shop joined to a series of stores front
        ing the mall  deckard runs to the opening shes made
        and pours fire through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        zhora breaks through one window after another getting
        sliced getting shot trying to get away from deckards
        laser  but she doesnt

        his last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull  it kills her but doesnt stop her  her speed
        takes whats left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it

        hunched over breathing hard deckard comes slowly for
        ward  the crowd starting to gather  theres something
        for everybody and theyre coming from all directions

        deckard moves through them edging to have a look

        its not a good thing to see  it looks like salome
        and the car tries to eat each other  a bloody feast
        of metal and flesh

        deckard bows his head sick exhausted  so much commo
        tion he doesnt notice three cops closing in from
        behind

                                cop
                  drop it!

        deckard has his back to them  theyre fanned out and
        crouched ready to fire  deckard drops his laser  two
        of them rush up spin him around while the third does a
        frisk

        two more cops arrive wary and wildeyed pushing the
        people back  his is not a good place for cops

        deckards ankle laser is discovered by the cop frisking
        him  with a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the sergeant covering the action

                                sergeant
                  on your belly!

        deckards not in the mood for it

                                deckard
                  listen sergeant

        hes reaching for his id  the cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head

        one thrill after another  somebody in the crowd yeowls
        the last thing deckard hears as he falls  the cop
        reaches inside deckards coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed but its an id card  he looks at it for a
        moment then looks up

                                cop
                  hey sarge this guys a cop

        an embarrassing situation

                                sergeant
                  clear this fuckin crowd

        the cops start pushing  and for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like leon

        int old opera house  mens room  night               67

        your standard low class crapper  bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger  this is a public place he doesnt want to
        yell

                                bryant
                  just because its a nexus 6 doesnt
                  change procedure  a little known
                  fact can become a wellknown fact
                  and part of our job deckard is
                  to make sure that doesnt happen
                  now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin
                  audience

        its not the sort of question that expects an answer
        deckards washing his face in the basin hoping itll
        all go away

                                bryant
                  well

        deckard looks up dripping reaches for a paper towel
        bryant slaps one in his hand

                                deckard
                  she was gonna get away

                                bryant
                  then let her get away  i thought
                  you were a pro  youre supposed
                  to be a fuckin tracker!

        bryant takes a couple of deep breaths

                                bryant
                  id say you got a little carried
                  away

        deckards voice is barely audible

                                deckard
                  i didnt like her

                                bryant
                  you didnt like her!

        he slams the handle on one of the urinals

                                bryant
                  you start liking or disliking
                  andies its time to hang it up

        the plumping roars and sucks and dies  theres nothing
        to do but nod  deckard nods  poor bastard has had a
        rough night  bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him  deckard puts it to his mouth and
        bryant watches deckards adams apple like hes count
        ing the swallows  deckard hands it back empty  bryant
        caps it puts it back in his pocket

                                bryant
                  look go home  get some rest
                  take an aspirin

                                deckard
                  yeah

        bryant shuffles out like an old bear

        int old opera house  bar  night                      68

        cheap whiskey and bad wine  thats the kind of place
        this is  its near closing  but still a few at the
        bar  alcoholic silhouettes

        in the bg deckard comes down the passage from the
        mens room and stops at the phone  he gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it  as he talks he leans
        against the wall his body language intimate and chummy

        not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself

        deckard hangs up walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool  the bartenders a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites

                                bartender
                  i cant protect your drinks
                  mister while you was in the
                  potty this hummer snatched it

        deckard glances at his stoolmate  a huge man slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale

                                deckard
                  no problem  gimme another

        the whale doesnt move but it speaks with a gravelly
        russian accent

                                russian
                  forgive me  i thought was free
                  drink  i will pay

                                deckard

        but the big mans digging through his pockets  deck
        ards drink arrives and the russian raises his head
        its a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his redrimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart  but its leon

                                leon

                                deckard
                  my pleasure

        deckard brings out his smokes  offers one  leon takes
        it and they light up  the drinks come

                                leon
                  prosit

                                deckard
                  prosit

        down the hatch  leon slaps his glass on the bar reach
        es into his pocket brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too  its done with such pride that
        deckard has to look

                                leon
                  you want to see my friends

                                deckard
                  sorry dont have the time

                                leon
                  no problem

        leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar

                                deckard
                  those cockroaches

                                leon
                  ya

        deckard looks interested  one of them starts to scamp
        er away but leon walls off the next with his huge hand

                                deckard
                  how long you had these guys

                                leon
                  two months  but this one is not
                  guy  it is girl  his girl

        leon leans closer like he doesnt want the cockroaches
        to hear

                                leon
                  usually blackie waits until igor
                  is eating then when his back is
                  turned he tries to take advantage
                  of anna

        deckard nods definitely interested  he signals the
        bartender for another round  the drinks arrive

                                leon
                  prosit

                                deckard
                  prosit

        down the hatch  their eyes meet at the bottom

                                leon
                  you never saw a cockroach make
                  love

        deckard shakes his head but hed like to

        leon smiles slyly

                                leon
                  we will try

        leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar  they both lean down and watch intently
        the drinks come and are put away but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating

                                leon
                  it must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot

        leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box  he holds up the last and kisses it

                                leon
                  you like to kiss her goodbye

                                deckard
                  no thanks

                                bartender
                  make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave

        what neither of them notices is that between leons
        fingers his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh

        deckard lifts his glass it is empty

                                leon
                  i like you

                                deckard
                  i like you too

                                leon
                  one more eh

                                deckard
                  i gotta piss

        deckard gets on his feet leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops

                                deckard
                  i think ill piss outside

        leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit

        ext alley  old opera house  night                    69

        deckard reels out  the door swings shut and hes sober
        as hell and moving fast  around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out aimed at the door  hes in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire  moments go by
        and hes glad for the time to steady himself  the
        sound of his breathing the hum of the city and the
        quiet

        suddenly from behind deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in leons beartrap embrace

        leon lets go and deckard hits the pavement skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand but leon is so
        fast hes already there and kicks it out of his hand

        leon moves towards him backing deckard against the wall

                                leon
                  how come you know where zhora was
                  so quick

        his hand is lightning  it shoots out grabs deckards
        hair

                                deckard
                  i showed pictures  somebody
                  recognized her  i went to see

        deckard is pale  the sweat is starting to run

                                leon
                  how old am i

                                deckard
                  i dont know

        the grip tightens and twists

                                leon
                  my birthday is april 10 2015
                  how long do i live

                                deckard
                  four years

        he lets go

                                leon
                  more than you

        deckards knees come up fast  leons fist comes down
        faster like a hammer

                                leon
                  painful to live in fear isnt it

        deckard is doubled over hugging his thigh

                                leon
                  but thats how it is to be a
                  slave  the future is sealed off
                  he grovels he waits

        even hurt deckard is fast  he goes for his ankle gun
        but leons got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley

        deckard hurls forward knocking him off balance and
        scrambles to get away  leon grabs him by the foot
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground

                                leon
                  sex reproduction security the
                  simple things  but no way to
                  satisfy them  to be homesick
                  with no place to go  potential
                  with no way to use it  lots of
                  little oversights in the nexus 6

        he slams deckard into the wall

                                leon
                  i tell you nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch

        deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles
        protecting his head with his arms waiting for the next
        one

        leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head pausing just a second to savor the satisfac
        tion of smashing deckards skull

        the spasm that runs through leons face is not from
        satisfaction  its the bullet that went through his
        neck  he hits the ground hard his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog  dead

        rachael is standing in the alley  deckard lies there
        looking at her  she comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops deckards gun by his side

        deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up but cant quite manage it  he looks up at her
        panting spits blood and almost smiles

                                deckard
                  like i said i dont need your
                  help

        after a long moment she bends down to touch him

                                rachael

        hes got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm  starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow up and down slow and slippery  she
        watches not quite sure of the ritual

        he pulls her closer and runs his hand up higher mould
        ing and pressing working around her flesh up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress

                                rachael

        hands are more reliable  they search over the bed

        looking around for signs but shes all gone  he
        gets up in two stages sits and then stands  then

        those hands in pris lap suddenly move almost faster

        her digging into the material with such ferocity that
        sebastian jumps  she plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff
        ing  except for the clenched teeth she is smiling like
        an angel

        int deckards apartment bedroom  day                  81

        rachael is lying across the bed in one of deckards
        shirts her chin over the edge her eyes moving around
        the room  deckard lies next to her  looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death

                                rachael
                  when was the last time you cleaned
                  this place

                                deckard
                  hmmm

                                rachael
                  have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment

                                deckard
                  dont be fooled by appearances

                                rachael
                  it appears to be dirty  why dont
                  you get somebody

        he rolls over to admire her legs

                                deckard
                  because they would ruin the
                  arrangement

        he kisses the back of her thigh

                                rachael
                  they could clean around the
                  arrangement

                                deckard
                  i dont like people snooping around
                  my stuff

        he kisses her other thigh gets up and goes into the
        bathroom

                                deckards voice
                  theres a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try

        rachael lies there a moment then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door  the vacuum is
        not easy to get to but finally she wrestles it out  as
        she starts to plug it in 

                                deckard
                  oh no dont do that

        hes wrapped in a sheet watching her from the doorway

                                rachael
                  but if i dont plug it in how can
                  i

                                deckard
                  never mind the plug just go
                  through the motions

                                rachael
                  but then how can you

                                deckard
                  i dont like the noise  just
                  practice  practice makes perfect

        she stares at him like hes nuts

                                deckard
                  im serious  go ahead  show me
                  how you would do it

        reluctantly she makes some halfhearted passes with the
        thing

                                deckard
                  how about under the couch there
                  come on

        she bends over to get it  deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands  she looks back
        at him

                                rachael
                  this feels stupid

                                deckard
                  good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid  part of your education

        she drops the vacuum and sits on the floor  deckard
        gets up and comes towards her  her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves

                                rachael
                  youre sick deckard

                                deckard

        on a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom
        the moment is sweetened by the low plaintive bellow of
        one of the animals

        he strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap pro
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion

        sebastian would rather put it in the bosss hands but
        styles takes it and is almost through the door when

        for the festive occasion  presents gathered around the

        griffon steps out of the shell

                                ian
                  oh!

        basically an avian invention it has wings and plumage
        the head of an eagle the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds  it cranes its neck and testing
        its balance stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air

        the littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling  turn
        ing in a fortyfive degree it suddenly drops into a
        dive

        delighted the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall  its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the tyrell clan

        reaching the end of the room it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table cups its wings spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing  theyre
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of ian

                                ian
                  papa!  did you make this

        tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk  sebastian
        hands down the invoices  tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check

        he looks up to hand it over when he sees batty against
        the wall by the door  for a fraction of a second hes
        shocked but recovers fast

                                tyrell
                  a friend of yours sebastian

                                sebastian
                  yes this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you dr tyrell

        very slowly tyrells hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk

                                batty
                  to act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid

        whats in battys eyes completes the warning  tyrell
        decides to heed it

                                batty
                  a little talk it all i need

        tyrell looks at sebastian  considers consequences
        back to batty

                                tyrell
                  would you like to talk in private
                  then

        batty thinks it over

                                batty
                  yeah  it might be better if we
                  talk in private sebastian  why
                  dont you go home

                  you later

        he slips out closing the door behind him  opens it
        again and sticks his head it

                                sebastian
                  was everything okay

                                tyrell
                  just beautiful

        hes gone

        if tyrell is scared hes doing a good job of concealing
        it

                                tyrell
                  im surprised you didnt come to
                  me sooner

                                batty
                  its not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker

                                tyrell
                  and what can he do for you

                                batty
                  can the maker repair what he makes

                                tyrell
                  would you like to be modified

                                batty
                  had in mind something a little more
                  radical

                                tyrell
                  whats the problem

                                batty
                  death

                                tyrell
                  im afraid thats a little out of
                  my

        batty cuts in with a whisper

                                batty
                  i want more life fucker

                                tyrell
                  come here

        batty walks forward

                                tyrell
                  sit down

        batty does

                                tyrell
                  the facts of life  ill be blunt
                  to make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system at least by men makers
                  or not it fatal  a coding sequence
                  cant be revised once its
                  established

                                batty
                  why

                                tyrell
                  because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies  like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship  the
                  ship sinks

                                batty
                  what about ems recombination

                                tyrell
                  weve already tried it  ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen  it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table

        batty nods grimly

                                batty
                  then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells

                                tyrell
                  wouldnt obstruct replication but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication so that the newly
                  formed dna strand carries a
                  mutation and youre got a virus
                  again but all this is academic
                   you are made as good as we could
                  make you

                                batty
                  but not to last

                                tyrell
                  put it this way  rolls royces are
                  made to last  as least they were
                  but im afraid youre a ferrari
                  a high strung racing car  built
                  to win not to last

        batty smiles bitterly

                                tyrell
                  also youre too valuable to
                  experiment with

                                batty
                  i am

        tyrell cant help a flash of pride

                                tyrell
                  the bast of all possible androids
                  were proud of our prodigal son 
                  glad youre returned  youre quite
                  a prize

        shoulders hunched batty looks down an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice

                                batty
                  ive done some questionable things

                                tyrell
                  also extraordinary things

                                batty
                  nothing the god of biomechanics
                  wouldnt let you in heaven for

        they share a laugh  in spite of himself theres a look
        of relief in tyrells face as batty extends his hand
        tyrell takes it and they shake  the reverence in bat
        tys eyes caused tyrell a fatherly smile  the smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack  before the scream comes out of his mouth batty
        stifles it

        tyrell claws at the iron fingers but theyre sinking
        into his face  placing his other hand behind tyrells
        head batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        mans head like a melon  the mess is not small

        palms up like a surgeon batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back strolls out
        of the room

        int tyrell  hall to kitchen  night                   90a

        styles is coming down the hall  he sees batty coming
        towards him  styles looks at him curiously this is not
        one of the guests  as they close batty smiles

                                batty
                  could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is

        styles doesnt get a chance to answer  battys hand has
        torn into his crotch  the man is lifted off the floor
        up the wall and held a moment  whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized  batty lets go  styles hits
        the floor  he died of shock  grinding his teeth batty
        continues towards the sounds of the festivities

        int dining room  night                                91

        the birthday cake has arrived the candles lit  theyre
        waiting for dad  mrs tyrell looks around to find batty
        observing from the doorway

        a little startled a little curious but ever the cor
        porate wife she smiles

                                mrs tyrell
                  may i help you

        batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets

        int kitchen  night                                    92

        in the sink the faucet is on  the water pink with
        blood  batty is washing his hands

        a portly maid emerges from the pantry  batty looks up
        she stops embarrassed at being caught  her eyes no
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door  when she looks back batty is right in front of
        her

        int deckards bedroom  night                          93

        legged with one in her lap looking through exquisite
        shots of nature  deckard is next to her watching her
        like a lover like a father

                  death like future like real  but
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions  she was
                  more alive than anyone id ever
                  known

        she looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo but with
        no need to comment  its in her eyes  she stares at
        him a revelation taking shape

        sebastian is putting his work table in order but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling

        batty pris and mary are on the other side of the room
        talking  their voices low

                                mary
                  lets go while there is still
                  time

        batty smiles

                                batty
                  whats the point

                                mary
                  not to be trapped

                                batty
                  you underestimate the trap mary

        sebastian has almost reached the door

                                batty
                  where are you going sebastian

                                sebastian

        they all watch

        sebastian walks away from the door

                                batty
                  think of yourself as a light mary
                  shine before youre turned off

        shes too fragile for that logic but it appeals to
        pris  she and batty hold a look that burns

        sebastian is by the window

                                sebastian
                  someone is coming here

        batty goes to the window and looks down

                                batty
                  one man
                         he smiles

                                mary
                  then go get him

                                batty
                  that wouldnt be very sporting

        sebastian looks ready to bolt  batty puts an arm
        around him

                                pris
                  i want to do it

                                batty

                  little for everybody  a
                  masterpiece

        a pause

        in the dim nocturnal light deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops  he looks
        around  nobody there just silence

        he comes closer to the building and stands in the sha
        dows off to one side of the entry

        his head jerks up to the sound of crashing glass

        sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below

        deckards eyes move up the line of descent the shat
        tered window on the nexttotop floor

        int sebastians apartment lobby  night                96

        not much to see but deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure  he looks around  elevator and stair
        well

        close to the wall he moves towards the elevator keep
        ing an eye on the stairwell door

        stepping to one side he hits the button  the elevator
        door slides open  he reaches in presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut deckard slips a pen between
        the doors jamming the operation

        deckards shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor  he pauses a moment in front of the stair
        well door then pushes it open and

        int stairwell sebastians apartment  night           97

        steps into the dark on the other side  suddenly he
        spins dropping to the floor and fires three times in
        to the figure hovering to his left

        the man is hanging off the floor his arms locked into
        the railing neck broken  with three holes in his
        chest but he was already dead

        deckard stares at the corpse  its mr deetchum the
        old watchman  that rustling sound are rats who were
        feeding on him scampering for safer places deckard
        gets to his feet

        the stairway rectangles ten stories up  as his foot
        touches the first step a raw terrified scream shatters
        the air  it came from below  its the cry of a young
        girl  it grows to a piercing shriek and abruptly
        stops  deckard ejects the halfused cartridge from his
        laser inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence
        descends the basement stairs

        int basement  night                                   98

        at the bottom he faces a corridor  the faint hum of
        machinery comes from the double doors at the far end
        the hum becomes a rattle by the time he gets there
        each door is fitted with a small window  deckard
        steps to the side and peers through

        int gym  night                                        99

        its a gym  the mirrorlined walls are cracked and
        tarnished the equipment atrophied from lack of use
        the heavier barbells have sunk into the floor  two
        weightreducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots  deckards eyes stop on the woman

        she dangles a few feet off the floor hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling
        her head is slung forward her body limp and slightly
        swaying

        deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall  slowly he advances toward the hanging figure
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door  hes not breathing hard  his heart isnt pound
        ing  deckards in his element

        close enough to look up into her face he stops  it
        isnt grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes  its the innocence of her angel face

        its not something he has time to consider  in the
        mirror behind him he sees the door starting to open
        deckard spins  he shouldnt have  pris legs snap up
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck

        slowly the door swings closed but deckard doesnt
        notice  his carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain  he jerks up his foot and reaches down
        as his fingers close around the ankle laser pris
        fingers close around his wrist  deckards hand opens
        like a flower  the laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head

                                pris
                  naughty naughty

        she lets go but before he can fall she rams a foot
        into his back  hes propelled fifteen feet across the
        room slams into a machine and falls to the floor
        pris flies off the rings and comes at him

        deckard reaches out to pull himself up but shes al
        ready there  not too hard and just in the right place
        she kicks him in the stomach  he goes back to the
        floor gagging for air  ohsoprecisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine

        its a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt  normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment but the motor housing
        on this one is missing  lots of grinding metal  a
        bad place for flesh and bone

        but thats where deckards hand is going  an eight
        yearold against a fulldown man  in two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round  deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose  it wont come  he yanks hard but
        its welded in hers

        his face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might  the hold breaks  they topple back  deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath  pris is up
        and coming for him again  she hovers over him  deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver

        reflexively deckard raises his arm to protect himself
        pris just smiles takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor  she doesnt like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished  theyre going back to the machine

        he goes by a weightstand of dumbbells and grabs hold
        it doesnt stop him  hes sliding over the floor like
        it was ice weight stand in tow

        pris gets to the machine yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening  deckard sits up a fivepound
        dumbbell in his hand and clobbers her in the back  it
        knocks her off balance but she doesnt let go of his
        foot  she hooks out with a fist but misses  he gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face

        she goes to the floor and deckards up the dumbbell
        over his head coming down with it  fighting for her
        life now pris drives a foot into his chest  it lifts
        him off the floor  he flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap

        no more games  pris is furious and moving fast  she
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and holding it over
        head charges him like a samurai  as she comes down
        for the kill she freezes

        deckard landed near the laser  he crawls towards it
        as in a nightmare it takes forever  but he gets there

        he reaches out and grabs the laser rolls over and
        takes careful aim  she charges towards him screaming
        her rage  he fires as she comes

        the shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder but
        her hand doesnt let go of the bar  it dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward

        he puts the next one through her neck  pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to deckard  dead

        he lies next to her chest heaving  slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees  panting he stag
        gers to his feet and stands over her swaying slightly
        the sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry  it
        might not sound like a war cry but it is

        int corridor  night                                   100

        laser in hand deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor a dangerous man

        int stairwell  night                                  101

        deckard arrives at the main floor landing checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs  hes going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong

        int stairwell  second floor  night                   101a

        on the next landing he throws the door open  his eyes
        move down the hall looking for prints in the dust
        none  he continues up the stairs

        int ninth floor  night                                102

        on the ninth floor he finds what hes looking for
        footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall  he stops to the side of it and listens  silence
        deckard fires three quick shots through the door  if
        somebody were on the other side of it they arent now

        he kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll pouring fire into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty  theres
        a kitchen bar a closet and a bedroom door both
        closed  deckards breathing is the only sound  no
        response from either door

        maybe it was a sound maybe intuition but suddenly
        deckard twists around and fires several shots into the
        closet  the smouldering door slowly creaks open

        mary is huddled in the rear of the closet  her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it  in her other hand she clutches a buttoneyed
        monkey  her face is bewildered frozen in fear her
        body riddled with holes  no recognition gap here
        deckard shoots her through the neck to make sure  mary
        falls to the floor like a puppet with her strings cut

        deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa unable to take his eyes
        off her

        deckard lays the laser down next to him holds out his
        hand and looks at it  its steady  he drops it in
        his lap closes his eyes and leans back

        a tapping from the ceiling  deckard looks up

        a knock  with the proverbial double rap at the end
        a pause  deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in  chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting  the hole is a couple feet
        in diameter  beams cracked through exposing the
        apartment above  silence  deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth then whispers

                                deckard
                  hello roy

        int stairwell  ninth and tenth floor  night          103

        deckard comes out onto the landing  taking his time
        he climbs the steps to the next floor the last floor
        he shoots the hinges out of the big stairwell door
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a bang
        the reverberations turn into silence  the corridor is
        empty

        int corridor  tenth floor  night                     104

        moving fast but cautious he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above sebastians  slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door

        int apartment  tenth floor  night                    105

        except for the hole in the middle of the floor theres
        nothing to see  back against the wall he moves to
        wards the bedroom but stops at the noise  it sounds
        like the hooting of an owl and its coming from the
        hallway

        int corridor  tenth floor  night                     106

        deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall  battys at the other end  except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes hes nude

                                batty
                  you wanna play

        deckard fires  battys fast  he ducks into a doorway
        pops out again

                                batty
                  not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent  i thought you
                  were supposed to be good  arent
                  you the man!

        the makeup on battys face is somewhere between a coman
        che warrior and a transvestite  the immensity of his
        insolence awesome  the muscles of his body are swol
        len trembling from the thrill of it

                                batty
                  this is how we do it up there lad!
                  come on!

        in a blue of lightninglike action batty whips down the
        hall zigzagging off the walls towards deckard so fast
        that deckard gets only three shots off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh

        deckard stands there a moment  digesting the impact
        of it then edges up to the gaping wall  batty is be
        hind him

        he knees deckard in the back and slaps him in the head
        deckard goes to his knees then over on his face
        batty kneels next to him

                                batty
                  not hurt are you  you better get
                  it up or im going to have to kill
                  you  unless youre alive you cant
                  play  and if you dont play you
                  dont get to be alive

        deckards eyes are closed mouth bleeding  he exhales
        and makes and effort  he slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push

                                batty
                  thats the spirit

        like a matador batty walks away  by the time deckards
        on his feet battys disappeared through one of the
        doors

        deckard wipes the blood from his mouth bends down and
        picks up his laser reloads and looks down the hall
        towards the jeering voice

                                battys voice
                  come on deckard show me what you
                  got!  im right here on the other
                  side of the door  but you gotta
                  shoot straight cause im fast!

        deckard gets to the door blasts it kicks it open and
        fires at batty  but its only the reflection of batty

        int room  tenth floor  night                         107

        the full length mirror on the other side of the room
        shatters  battys next to him grabs deckards hand
        and steps in closer

                                batty
                  straight doesnt seem to be good
                  enough

        theyre face to face

                                batty
                  you dont have a chance do you

        in an exaggeration of weary disappointment batty drops
        his head to the side

                                batty
                  looks like im gonna have to scale
                  it down for you  give you a
                  handicap  i wont run through any
                  more walls  okay  i promise to
                  use the doors  okay

        deckard stares back at him but doesnt respond  sud
        denly fury storms through batty  he throws deckard out
        the door knocking him down grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall

                                batty
                  come on lets use that brain!

        int tenth floor corridor  night                       108

        he drags him down the hall on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again

                                batty
                  think!  we need a little
                  resilience around here!

        he yanks him further and bashes his head again

                                batty
                  where are those balls of yours!
                  lets see a little bravery!

        the storm passes

        deckard hangs in battys hand like a bag of laundry

                                batty
                  that was irrational of me  not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike  wont
                  happen again

        he drops him

                                batty
                  ill be down the hall when youre
                  ready

        betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors

        deckard gets to his knees leans against the wall a mo
        ment then punches it with his fist

        on his feet hes a little wobbly  holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing he listens  no
        sound  no sign of batty  the laser is laying nearby
        he doesnt bother

        deckard is backing down the hall quiet as he can  he
        had a job to do  he would like to have done it but
        hes not insane  he gets to the landing and turns

        on the first step down he stops  battys on the land
        ing below looking up at him

                                batty
                  where you going

        he wait a moment for deckards answer

                                batty
                  no cheating  a promise is a
                  promise  ill honor the
                  handicapped but we gotta play on
                  the top floor  you go get your
                  laser gun now  and ill give you
                  a few seconds before i come

        deckard turns back into the hall  batty smiles

        deckards running down the corridor

                                battys voice
                  one!

        halfway down the hall he finds his laser

                                battys voice
                  two!

        deckard darts into the nearest door  the apartment
        above sebastians with the hole in the floor  deckard
        considers it

                                battys voice
                  no fair jumping through holes  you
                  might get hurt doing that!  three!

        deckard dashes back into the hall chooses another door
        and goes in

        int tenth floor apartment  night                      109

        his eyes skim over everything looking for an advantage
        he throws open a door  the bathroom  the plumbing is
        dismantled walls stripped revealing brick nails
        protruding  too small

        int tenth floor stairwell  night                      110

        battys coming up the steps

                                batty
                  five!

        int tenth floor apartment  night                      111

        deckards looking for a corner  a place that covers
        the angles  he chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door

        int tenth floor hall  night                           112

        battys coming down the center listening at the doors

                                batty
                  six!

        int tenth floor apartment  night                      113

        deckards crouched in the corner and aimed  he looks at
        his hand  its trembling

                                battys voice
                  seven!

        int tenth floor hall  night                           114

        battys standing in front of a door listening

                                batty
                  oh i wonder where he is  not in
                  here i dont think  eight!

        he goes to the next door

                                batty
                  maybe here  doesnt sound like
                  it  nine!

        batty moves to the next  the door to deckard

        int tenth floor apartment  night                      115

        deckards crouched lower holding his breath  talk
        about a hair trigger silence  battys feet are heard
        creaking away  deckard looks around  runs a hand over
        the wall behind him  battys feet come back  a pause

                                batty
                  ten!

        the door explodes!

        a shape hurtles across the room  deckard pivots fol
        lowing it with rapid fire  its a tv  he spins back
        but battys already on him  he gets one shot off be
        fore battys got his hand  theres a hole over battys
        right eye  blood running down his face dripping on
        deckard  the right side of his face isnt working too
        good  the corner of his mouth doesnt quite shut 
        his voice comes out slurred a little hollow

                                batty
                  one point for you

        the would doesnt minimize his omnipotence just makes
        it more malignant  he throws deckard against the far
        wall  deckard fires  hits batty in the shoulder

                                batty
                  ho ho!  try it again!

        he comes at deckard jerking back and forth a cobra in
        fast motion faking weaving yelping with excitement
        as deckard tries to get a shot firing away until his
        lasers empty  bloody and crazed batty pushes up
        against him

                                batty
                  whats wrong  dont you like me
                  im what weve made!

        int tenth floor hall  night                           116

        hes backing deckard out the door  deckard trips and
        falls  theres fear on his face  the strength is gone
        something is starting to crack

                                batty
                  whats wrong  arent you a lover
                  of faster bigger and better!

        deckards pedaling backwards over the floor

                                batty
                  its time to die

        deckard throws the laser at him  it misses  batty
        throws his head back and laughs  a oneeyed colossus
        about to eat the world  suddenly he stops  his eye
        moves over the wall

                                batty
                  ah!

        he reaches out and pinches something  his lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall  its a tenpenny nail

        he holds it out to deckard and drops it  deckard
        catches it

                                batty
                  thats for you

        one side of battys face smiles savagely

                                batty
                  stick it in your ear and push
                  if that doesnt work try the
                  eye

        deckard stares at the nail in his hand then up at
        his executioner

                                batty
                  believe me itll be better
                  for you than what im about
                  to do

        batty watches him hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action  it doesnt look like it

                                batty
                  well

        deckard springs to his feet and bolts  but instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door

        int tenth floor apartment #2  night                   117

        provocation accomplished batty smiles and walks lei
        surely towards the door  deckards terrified scream
        and the sound of glass crashing stop him  batty speeds
        up and moves into the room

        the window pane is splattered curtains sucked out
        bellowing in the wind

                                batty
                  crap

        he walks up to the window  deckard comes away from the
        wall inching up behind him laser in both hands aimed
        at the base of battys skull  batty starts to lean
        over but even before his eyes see the pavement he
        knows  he spins

        deckard fires again  this one goes home  batty falls
        like he was poleaxed hits the floor dead weight

        deckard starts to tremble  his arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes  he can breathe
        again
        
        on the floor battys hand is crawling toward deckards
        ankle

        with the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel deckard comes down  face knotted in hor
        ror he empties the laser in battys body  but the
        hand holds on  with a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at battys dead
        fingers  but the fingers are welded shut

        deckard starts to crawl pulling batty behind him  he
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet

        int tenth floor hall  night                           118

        deckard plunges down the corridor dragging batty along
        he falls gets to one foot falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell

        int tenth floor stairwell  night                      119

        groaning he tugs and pulls hauls and heaves battys
        body to the edge of the landing  he pauses for breath
        then lays back wedging his feet against battys shoul
        ders and pushes  inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge  then all at once it drops  but the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes deckard with it  as
        deckard slides over the edge he grabs hold of the
        railing

        deckards hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor supporting himself and battys corpse  almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers
        
        with his free foot he chops away at battys hand try
        ing to break it loose  but its not working  deckards
        fingers are starting to slip

        his face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        battys thumb  with the help of gravity and everything
        hes got in his right leg to push with he pushes  the
        thumb breaks loose  batty falls

        the sound of his body hitting below sounds good but
        deckard doesnt notice  hes in an awkward position
        he must reverse the way hes facing to pull himself up
        he lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left  then turns the left around so hes got an over
        hand grip

        like a man doing his last pullup the one that cant
        be done deckard pulls himself up throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing

        and lies there body jerking spasmodically slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand but its
        his burning cheek against the cool metal hes most aware
        of

        dizzy hot lungs on fire he stands  and putting one
        foot in front of the other deckard descends the stairs

        slowly the door pushes open and deckard comes out into
        the morning  the sun isnt yet risen but the sky has
        begun to pale  its a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty but even though he cant show it deckard
        is glad to see it

        for a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street so dead on his feet he hasnt the energy to
        fall

        deckard slumps into the shelter of his car  the col
        lapses on the front seat

        int deckards bedroom  dawn                           121

        in a corner of the dimness deckard sits slumped on a
        chair facing the pearly gray light of the window  the
        only sound in the room is the soft steady breathing
        that comes from the bed

        quietly he gets up and walks over to her  rachael lies
        sleeping one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet

        deckard stands there bettered and grim staring down
        at her

        moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed

        rachael opens her eyes and looks up at him she smiles

        deckards car is skimming over the narrow highway  he
        and rachael in the front seat  except for the occasion
        al glance their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream

        the clouds overhead are soft and swift

                                deckard vo
                  she wanted to go to a place i knew
                  out of the city  like one of those
                  pictures she saw  where there were
                  trees but no buildings

        rachaels face in the window watching the woods stream
        by

                                deckard vo
                  we had a good time  she told me a
                  funny story and i taught her a
                  song  a song about monkeys and
                  elephants  and it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldnt sing

        deckard and rachael walking  the land lays white and
        hushed before them

        down an aisle of maples and beeches  the frosty light
        slanting through the clean hard limbs

        the crisp bluewhite snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth

        rachael stops and faces him  her lips are parted her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor  looking
        lithe and fragile by these barrenrooted trees she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at deckard
        nothing in her retreats even now her eyes insist on
        knowing

        deckard walking over the snow  alone  he walks slowly
        mechanically through the cold unaffected by it  his
        gaunt face empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks

        but for the squeak of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow there is no sound  and deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape

        deckards car solid throbbing gunning along like
        some metal animal  headlights piercing the dark of the
        long flat road  whistling speed of air and tires spin
        ning thrum  and then silence  and the silence
        astounded by the crack of a gun

        int car  night                                        126

        deckard is behind the wheel face in shadow eyes star
        ing straight ahead

                                deckard vo
                  i told myself over and over again
                  if i hadnt done it they would
                  have

                  i didnt go back to the city not
                  that city i didnt want the job

                  she said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice
                  and she chose  and a part of me
                  was almost glad  not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her

                  as for tyrell  he was murdered
                  but he wasnt dead  for a long
                  time i wanted to kill him  but
                  what was the point  there were too
                  many tyrells  but only one rachael
                  maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated  the secret never
                  found  but i got as close with
                  her as id ever come to it  shed
                  stay with me a long time  i guess
                  we made each other real

        and the ruby lights of deckards car disappear into
        the darkness
        
        
        
        					the end
