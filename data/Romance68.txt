          the radio noise is drowned out by the a capella soprano
          voice of a young indian boy as he sings a melodic hindi
          prayer

          int airplane cabin  night


          the worst nightmare imaginable
          slow motion the plane is going down fasts everyone panics
          and screams in slow motion as the oxygen masks away like
          plastic pendulums the soprano voice continues the prayer

          andrew largeman large 25 is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards god even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at halfspeed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle andrew largeman sits
          peacefully unaffected

          he calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him he looks up to

          the fasten seat belt sign

          it bings as the light flashes on and off the binging
          continues more and more frequently at first in rhythm with
          the prayer and then it dissolves into the ring of an

          electronic telephone

          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps

          his byes bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like theyre chasing each other in a game of tag

          cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the
          tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto
          her lyrics sheet as a rainbow of tears splatter the words
          once and twice
          the song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of hebrew
          prayers large squints through the mourners to see his father

          been going on

                         large
          well i think ive had them in some
          form since i was a little kid but
          theyve been getting more and more
          frequent over the last year

                         doctor
          looking at chart
          how long have you been on the
          lithium

                         large
          oh uh ive been on some form of it
          since i was ten or so

                         doctor
          and what about paxil zoloft
          celexa depakote did any of that
          ever help you

                         large
          no i mean i dont know its
          recently occurred to me that i
          might not even have a problem only
          id never know it because as far
          back as i can remember ive been
          medicated i grew up on it i left
          them in la this is the first time
          i havent had it in my body since i
          can remember

                         doctor
          well itll leave your body pretty
          fast ill write you a
          prescription

                         large
          actually i was thinking about
          taking a little vacation

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         â¢ 42

                         doctor
          have you spoken to your
          psychiatrist about that

                         large
          eh well my psychiatrist is my dad
          so uh he i think hed prefer
          me to stay on it he likes to think
          it makes me happy and i let him
          think that because hes sort of
          consumed by the idea of making
          everyone happy

                         doctor
          well look ill examine you and
          give you a catscan just so you
          wont worry that its anything
          serious but to be honest i think
          the headaches are something else
          our bodies do very funny things
          when theyre consumed with stress
          and anxiety things youd never
          expect i found my exbest friends
          cuff links in my wifes puree and i
          couldnt get an erection for a year
          and a half

                         beat
          for example

                         large
          but that doesnt really feel like
          it i mean i dont feel stressed or
          really anxious at all

                         doctor
          well with all the lithium hes had
          you on its amazing you can even
          hear me right now_

                         large
          oh right

                         doctor
          first of all i do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isnt
          your father that justs something
          that should have been remedied
          years ago he knows better
          secondly im not in a position to
          comment on whether or not you
          should stay on the meds or not i
          dont know your story but my
          opinion since youre paying for
          it is that those drugs may help as
          a means to an end but if youre
          not in any sort of therapy sooner
          or later whats ever going on in
          your mind will find a way to peek
          its little head out of the water
          just something to think about

                         more

          funeral where no one shows up
          dont you ever think about wholl
          show up to yours

                         cynthia
          no right now im alive so i think
          about living

                         large
          its one way to determine who your
          friends are the people whod show
          up at my funeral if it was held in
          their state thats one level of
          friend but my real friends the
          people who really love me theyd
          come if it was on the other side of
          the country

                         cynthia
          so where do i fall into that

                         large
          youd be there

                         cynthia
          oh you think so

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         61

                         large
          i do i think youd show up because
          the truth is that you really did
          miss met you always thought of me
          as the brother you never had but
          youve got too much pride to let me
          know that you want to pout cause
          i dont return your calls

                         cynthia
          youre way more talkative than i
          remember

                         large
          today ive been more talkative than
          i remember

                         cynthia
          what about mine

                         large
          funeral honestly i probably
          wouldnt travel for it no but
          dont worry im sure youll have a
          great turnout

                         cynthia
          why do you say that

                         large
          cause theres also the guy who
          lives his life to insure a good
          turnout i think thats how my dad
          lives his like hes sort of
          writing his own eulogy as he goes
          and making life choices dependent
          on how it will sound in a speech

                         cynthia
          are you implying that thats why
          im going to med school or
          something

                         large
          im just saying a lot of people 
          not necessarily you  a lot of
          people try and accumulate accolades
          that will somehow justify their
          lives

                         cynthia
          its said we spend ninetyfive
          percent of our lives trying to look

          how about sucking it up and really
          having it out with your dad that
          would be a tremendous step towards
          not needing to look good

          if you dont want to talk about
          this its perfectly fine but im
          just

                         gideon
          no i can i know i figured you
          would want to

                         large
          but we dont have to do it now i
          mean you dont have to do that now
          its just at some point i would
          i have some questions

                         gideon
          i knew that you would
          silence

                         gideon contd
          occasionally she would hum your
          mother always the same tune and i
          never knew what the song was i
          dont even know if it was a song or
          if she just made it up  its funny
          because it always struck me as so
          out of character for her and every
          time she did it i just always
          liked it but i never told her i
          could hear her because i knew if i
          ever did she would stop

                         beat
          she took a bath every night and
          she was always very quiet

                         more

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         65
          the only thing i would ever hear
          when im in the bedroom was a
          little splashing of water when she
          was moving around and every now
          and then her humming

                         beat
          so anyway then usually she would
          call me when she was done so i
          could come and help her out but
          this time that night she never
          called and i just figured she was
          taking a longer bath or something
          but when i called out to her she
          didnt answer so then i uh when
          i came in she was there

                         large
          so she didnt yell or

                         gideon
          no i didnt hear anything the tv
          was on pretty loud i always watch
          the weather report before i go to
          sleep

                         large
          its just weird

                         gideon
          what

                         large
          i dont know its just that youd
          think if someone was really
          drowning to death they would
          scream i mean really scream from
          the terror of it all you know
          they would splash and scream i
          would think i would have thought

                         gideon
          i would have too but no nothing
          off larges look
          what

                         large
          dont take this the wrong way

                         gideon

                         66

                         gideon
          its not that

                         large
          im just saying did they check i
          mean has someone ruled that out

                         gideon
          no because they know she drowned

                         large
          and i suppose it doesnt even
          really matter but id be curious
          to know i would like to know if
          thats what happened just for me
          i mean would that surprise you

                         gideon
          no yee!

                         large
          she made it very clear to everyone
          she knew that nothing was ever
          going to make her happy

                         gideon

          shes found it now i know that
          and i know theres a certain amount

          his lap and his arms over his head it takes everything large
          has to reach out his hand and almost touch his fathers
          shoulder but he doesnt make it and his hand lands on the
          sink next to him

          these drugs that were supposed to
          curb my anger and ive been on
          some form of them ever since my
          mother who was clinically depressed
          before the accident sank even
          lower to the point where she just
          ignored everyone but our
          housekeeper janice and her
          daughter cynthia and when i was
          sixteen my psychiatrist dad came
          around to the conclusion that it
          might not be the healthiest
          environment for me to be growing up
          in so he sent me to boarding

          they play wrestle as sam watches

          ext kiernans quarry  moments later

          the three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal

          an enormous abandoned quarry
          colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the
          distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti
          the center of the quarry goes so deep they cant see the
          bottom they stand on the edge rain clouds rapidly drift
          overhead this glace is surreal

                         sam
          wow

                         large

                         mark
          ive heard about it they were
          supposed to build a mall here i
          think

                         sam

          the paper

                         more

          they were digging one day and they
          broke through into this like
          natural phenomenon its like an
          underground grand canyon or
          something so now theyre in some
          huge legal battle over whether they
          can build here or not

                         large
          can you imagine the guy whos job
          it is to fight for the right to
          build his mall on some like
          geological phenomenon

                         mark
          they love their malls here man

          getting

                         mark
          its a surprise youll see
          mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down
          alongside the abyss

          ext 1cternians quarry  later

          further down the path sam looks to large he uses an old mop
          handle hes found as a walking stick
          as they continue along the path it begins to get continually
          cluttered with rusty junk an old bedframe a porcelain tub
          remnants of a junglegym dirty broken toys
          further along down the path amidst the junk they see a thirty
          foot dilapidated souse boat perched on cement blocks that
          sits right on the edge of the cliff its windows glow warm
          and welcoming
          mark stands in front of the boat this isnt what he
          expected rain begins to fall

                         mark
          i guess this is it

                         large
          so knock knock and barter for
          dessert storm trading cards

          please dont tease me about my
          hobbies i dont tease you about
          being an asshole
          they stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat mark
          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull

          after a moment albert a very gentle looking man in his mid
          thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears
          on the deck he smiles warmly

                         albert
          in a whisper
          mark

                         mark
          yeah are you albert

                         albert
          with a smile
          yes come on in out of the rain
          sam and large look at each other then follow mark up an a
          frame ladder that sits next to the hull

          int alberts boat  continuous

          they step inside and the door closes behind them its very
          cozy and warm great music plays a wood burning stove heats
          the room and throws warm amber light onto a small living room
          with deep cushy couches

                         albert
          you guys must be freezing make
          yourselves warm by the fire im
          just gonna go put her down ill be
          right out
          the three of them huddle by the fire they speak in quiet
          whispers

                         sam
          i must say ive been continually
          impressed today with how each new
          place you bring us manages to be
          weirder and weirder

                         mark
          what do you mean this is nice

                         large

          albert returns with faye an equally gentle and caring
          looking woman in her early thirties

          of a sudden

          private ark unfortunately if
          this is the apocalypse im not

                         marx
          no thanks
          faye crosses to a small kitchen they all sit there politely
          nodding at each other

                         large
          what is it that you do here what
          is this place

                         albert
          good question were calling it
          kiernans fault and no ones
          really quite sure what it is
          because they havent been able to
          explore it theyre locked in a
          legal battle over who has the
          rights to the land

                         more

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         102
          so one of these days it will either
          be a national park or a shopping
          mall but while their locked in
          litigation i was hired to make
          sure no one comes inside

                         large
          oh wow

                         albert
          what they dont know is that im a
          geologist working undercover for
          the preservation lobby so at
          night i go down

                         faye
          hes documenting it to support
          their case

                         sam
          wow so how deep does it go

                         albert
          no one really knows ive been in
          the furthest and that was about two
          miles down but i like to pretend
          its infinite

                         11
          faye brings them tea

                         sam
          its kind of an odd job isnt it
          guardian of an infinite abyss

                         albert
          yeah i guess it is we also trade
          and deal in antique jewelry i
          suppose its pretty odd for you that
          we live down here like this

                         sam
          no

                         large
          not at all

                         mark
          never crossed my mind

                         albert
          but we think its important

                         large
          why what do you think youll find

                         albert
          i dont know its exciting new
          frontiers are hard to come by these
          days i guess i just like the idea
          of discovering something

                         more

          that no ones ever done before
          large looks to sam

                         large
          yeah alberts abyss

                         albert
          who knows maybe but i used to
          think that was all that mattered
          no matter what it was as long as i
          could put my name on it like it
          would somehow justify the fact that
          i lived that i was here i did
          that thats mine i got this plate
          on my travels but you know what
          thats all ego none of that stuff
          really matters if at the end of
          the day i get to be with her if i
          get to be with this person right
          here and the baby we created then
          thats all i need just having
          felt that if i die in an hour i
          know ive lived
          faye kisses his forehead

                         large
          you know my whole life ive had
          that same anxiety that if i didnt
          discover something or save
          something or

                         sam
          save something from being
          discovered

                         large
          yeah that ill have somehow wasted
          my time here and that somewhere
          whatever force created us would
          resent me for it

                         albert
          well i think that force would
          rather remind you that breathings
          all it takes to be a miracle
          he takes a deep breath large sam and mark stare at albert
          transfixed hes like a sage

          great music begins

                         albert
          well i suppose you want what you
          came all the way down here for

                         marx

          piece down but i owe diego huge
          he pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to

          mother its so weird i havent
          thought about this in so long but
          this great memory i have where i
          was a little kid and i was crying
          for one reason or another and she
          was kind of holding me and rocking
          me back and forth and i could see
          the little balls in this thing just
          rolling back and forth and there
          was just snot dripping down my
          nose

                         he laughs
          and she just handed me her sleeve
          and told me to just blow my nose
          into it and i remember thinking
          even as a very little kid wow
          this is love
          more tears start to well and overflow from his eyes he tries
          to stifle them with a laugh he cradles the pendant

                         large contd
          this is love and it just felt
          so good to be there so safe
          and i didnt feel safe very often
          but at that moment
          tears are now streaming down his face as well as sams she
          holds the plastic cup in her hand

          memory maybe if i did i could help

          well we might have a shot at it if
          you could just forgive yourself for
          what you did

          now and im not gonna i mean
          im not gonna take all those drugs
          anymore because theyve left me
          completely numb i have felt so

          gideon site up against the headboard

                         large contd
          youve always said you wanted us to
          have whatever it is we wanted
          well maybe what mom wanted more
          than anything was for it to all be
          over and for me what i really
          want more than anything is for it
          to be okay with you for me to feel
          something again even if its pain

                         gideon
          going against your doctors
          recommendation thats a pretty
          weighty experiment to take on dont
          you think

                         large
          with a chuckle
          this is my life dad this is it
          ive spent twentysix years waiting
          for something else to start so no
          i dont think its too much to take
          on because its everything there
          is

                         beat
          i see now its all there is

                         gideon
          perhaps the great tragedy of my
          life will be that you both
          deserved more than i knew how to
          give

                         large
          we deserved nothing more than you
          and you deserved nothing more than
          us
          large puts his hand on the center of his fathers bare chest

                         large contd
          you and i are gonna be okay you
          know that right

          we may not be as happy as you
          always hoped wed be but for the
          first time lets allow ourselves to
          be whatever it is that we are
