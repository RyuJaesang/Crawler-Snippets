          very modest furnishings are nice but sparse jonathan hangs
          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers

          int jonathans bedroom

          public access on which xrated clips advertise phone sex
          jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                   then clicks
          back to the roaring soccer crowd he closes his eyes and
          drifts off to the frenetic portuguese of an unseen announcer

          int rutherford stern law offices  coffee lounge  morning

          two corporate lawyers are talking shop while pouring coffee

          jonathan                                                         0s

          again jonathan works alone at one end of the long table
          rapidly typing eyes pingponging from files to laptop
          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastelcolored post
          its on which are scribbled various calculations he strikes
          us as extremely good at his job tackling the overwhelming
          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance
          taking a break he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
          him behind the glass employees pass like fish in a tank

          int mens washroom  day

          in a stall jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
          stalls marble door  when a sudden knockknock on the

          wyatt
          you kidding this is an early night hard
          to believe that once upona time a mans
          success was measured by how little he had
          to work you know in sweden the average
          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation
          regards his stacked files
          doyou like accounting

          subsidized my graduate degree

          so bad though im sure a lot of people
          have had it worse

          jonathans laptop screen to wyatt and jonathan sitting on
          top of the expensive conferencetable passinga joint
          staring out at the rain hammering the far windows

          jonathan

          stoned
          its just sometimes i feel so  i dont
          know  removed i mean i work for one of
          the biggest accounting firms in the world
          andtheres not so much as a desk there to
          prove it theyve decided all we need are
          cell phones and laptops messages are
          voicemailed documents emailed salarys
          deposited online chet peterson my senior
          manager i swear he wouldnt recognize me
          if i was sitting in his chair
          jonathan pauses takes another drag train of thought drifts

          jonathan
          i dont know i used to have friends
          but its like ive spent so much time
          trying to prove myself working these
          hours                                                            you can only do it so long before

          everyone and i try to meet people at
          work i do but its always the same to
          the accounting staff im a pain because
          for two weeks they have to hold their
          breath and hope i dont pick up on any of
          their screw ups and to everyone else im
          just a temporary fixture so why bother
          the truth is this is the first meaningful
          conversation ive had in i dont know how
          long its like if i disappeared tomorrow
          im not sure anyone other than solange
          would even notice  shes my neighbor i
          live on what must be the only block in
          brooklyn that still isnt hip

          exhales
          i guess i just never countedon the
          isolation its like sometimes i look
          through that glass and i see life

          just talked for                                                 37                                       minutes straight
          wyatt looks at jonathan  and cracks up jonathan hesitates
          then he too starts to laugh so now they cant stop their
          laughter filling the expansive room  until its drowned by
          the sound advance of pouring rain

          ext midtown  street  late night

          jonathan hurries in the cold rain for the times square
          subway hes just about to descend  when across                7th avenue
          he spots a beautiful young woman in a camel hair coat
          clutching a slim briefcase waiting to cross the street
          jonathan gazes at her almost gasping shes surrounded by
          pedestrians with umbrellas shes the only one without one
          and shes drenched but she seems content to entertain
          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
          umbrella in front of her
          jonathan watches intrigued  and then the rumble of the
          subway below reminds him hed better move

          

          

          

          

          10

          int times square subway station  late night

          jonathan stands in a long line to buy a metrocard his
          glasses steamed up he takes them off to wipe the lenses
          jonathans pov the entire station is a blur all unfocused
          muted colors no object discernible from another 
           until his glasses return his pov to immediate focus and he
          sees the same young woman inthe camelhair coat a pair of
          dollar bills in her hand entering the station
          jonathan cant help but stare again despite her business
          attire theres an almost childlike lightness to her step
          jonathan notices her slim briefcase beneath her hand he can
          make out the first letter of a monogram s
          she checks out the long line for metrocards considers
          waiting then decides lifes too short she continues past
          headed for the turnstiles
          jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase
          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow
          gap in the turnstile
          a panhandler on the other side watches her with amusement
          glancing up she catches his eye and blushes a mischievous
          smile once shes through she drops her money into his
          collection  and slips out of view
          angle on jonathan still stuck on line staring at the space
          she vacated

          int subway platform  short time later

          jonathan arrives as an n train pulls away the platform now
          practically empty
          weary and still a bit stoned jonathan peers sleepily into
          the dark expanse of tunnel yawns 
          and then he sees s is waiting on the same platform ten
          yards away he gazes at her shes unwrapping some gum he
          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth
          the sound of an arriving n train s heads for it jonathan
          follows
          the train halts the door before him is the last of its car
          the door before her the first of the next
          the doors open

          continued

          s enters her car jonathan wavers wants to follow into her
          car but doesnt have the nerve he enters a different car

          int subway car  later

          jonathans slumped against a window annoyed at himself for
          not getting in her car
          he can see s she sits in the other car chewing her gum he
          studies her hes absolutely knocked out by her

          conductor os
          next stop canal street canal is next
          he sees s rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
          door
          jonathan stands up  his last chance determined he braces
          himself and rises grasping his briefcase
          the screeching of brakes as the train grinds into canal st

          station
          a sudden jolt of the braking traincauses jonathan to stumble
          slightly and his briefcase bangs against a seat and snaps
          open  contents tumbling out his cell phone hits the floor
          jonathan quickly bends for his phone  when the train lurches
          to a halt nearly knocking him over and sliding his cell
          phone a few feet along the grimy floor
          os we hear the hiss of the doors opening as jonathan grabs
          for his phone a second before its stepped on he hurriedly
          stuffs it in his pocket shoves his files and papers and
          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet 
           to find the doors closing and s gone

          continued

          continued
          devastated he hurries to a window searching the platform as
          the train begins to depart he can just glimpse the back of
          her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel
          he stands helpless just shuts his eyes and lowers his head

          int rutherford stern  coffee lounge  morning

          jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing wyatt
          enter talking animatedly with lawyers                          1   and 2 caught up in
          telling his joke wyatt doesnt seem to notice jonathan
          only when the lawyers burst out laughing does wyatt glance
          up his eyes meet jonathans jonathan smiles in greeting 
          but wyatt just nods coolly returns to his fellow lawyers
          jonathans smile falters he exits wordlessly

          int rutherford stern  day

          she sighs put upon then slides out a desk drawer in which a
          laminated page of names and extensions is taped jonathans

          a gruff voice os

          a grin on wyatts face as he savors the battle blasting back
          each ball the women step aside jonathan lunges barely
          managing to lob a return sensing victory wyatt raises his
          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball
          jonathan dives racket overextended  and returns a
          near perfect shot just over wyatts head but it lands two
          inches outside the opposite baseline

          from behind it looks remarkably like s
          only as she turns her profile proves otherwise

          same  moments later
          jonathan emerges freshly showered a towel around his waist
          as he walks toward the rows of lockers

          jonathan
          who

          wyatt
          a guy i roomed with freshman year at
          princeton real smart                                  witty too when
          you loosened him up only from day one he
          just didnt fit in for starters he was
          dirt poor but it wasnt that see there
          was always this boundary  this wall 
          between getz and everyone else you could
          argue we laid the foundation but he built
          it built it by believing the lie

          jonathan
          what lie

          wyatt
          that he was any different the clothes
          the money the wry anecdotes  its all
          one big masquerade anyone can get in
          youve just got to wear a costume but
          getz never got that he assumed he could
          never scale the wall when the truth is he
          was the only one guarding it it never
          occurred to him his anonymity could be an
          asset no one gets over like the guy whos
          just a face an impression we are  all
          of us                                                   only who were perceived to be

          for a young man to be too much alone
          he gives her an uncomfortable smile she smiles back but as
          she heads inside she looks bothsad and worried for him

          disappears inside we remain on the vacant street hear his
          footsteps climbing the steps  and then the muted ring of his
          cell phone a beat then another
          and the front door opens again as jonathan steps back out
          into the night

          int the hudson hotel  lobby  late night

          checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits jonathan
          faintly hears what sounds like wyatts laugh he quickly

          cell phone is ringing he picks up

          jonathan

          pleasure or pain

          jonathan

          jonathan
          so how come you got involved in the club
          she frowns slightly thinks
          âs  if
          wouldnt it be great if you could just
          meet someone and not have to do the work/
          family/previous relationships thing
          isnt who we are right now so much more
          interesting than where weve come from

          jonathan
          sure but that didnt really answer my
          question
          she reaches over and takes his hand holds it tenderly

          thirty this year and i made this vow to
          live only in the present and its good
          you know and yes maybe its because
          there are things in my past i dont care
          to think about  but thats the same for
          everyone isnt it
          he nods still holding hands loving every moment of this
          is s  â

          jonathan smiles completely disarmed by her the waiter
          brings their food and goes

          jonathan
          i wasnt asking for an autobiography you

          jonathan

          âs  110

          he beams gazing at her blushing she starts in on the food
          outside we can hear rain starting to fall

          ext chinatown restaurant  later

          jonathan and s step out into pouring rain pause under the
          shabby awning waiters inside are putting chairs on tables
          she fishes in her coat and pulls out a pack of gum the
          wrapper is entirely in chinese she offers him a piece

          jonathan
          oh  no thanks

          jis11

          buy it at a store nearby it has ginseng
          in it you know for energy its not bad
          though it sort of tastes like hairspray
          she chews her gum he watches her the jaw line her lips
          she looks at him and smiles but theres something behind it
          a sadness almost an uneasiness

          jonathan

          she wipes the lenses then peering into his eyes slowly
          leans in to return them to his face only she presses her
          lips to his instead the glasses still in her hand the kiss
          itself at once tender and passionate
          she absently lowers her hand lost in the unexpected
          intensity of the kiss embraced they accidentally step under
          the sheet of water falling off the awning jonathan guides
          her back beneath the awnings shelter
          at s is
          breathless whisper
          maybe you should go

          maybe you should stay
          she smiles as he kisses her even more passionately again
          they feel the awnings drops and jonathan moves to shelter
          them 
           only s leans into him instead leading him out from under
          the awning the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
          as they continue to kiss the moment purely exhilarating
          wiping the rain from her face jonathan gazes at her soaked
          and utterly beautiful with something akin to awe  like hes
          just breathed for the very first time

          he jostles the door handle it wont budge hes getting
          anxious now his breath quickening he tries the key card
          again red he pounds harder then slams his shoulder into
          the door nothing
          desperate he tries the key card again  and the light turns
          green                                                           a milliseconds surprised hesitation  then he jerks
          the handle throws open the door and jonathan tumbles into

          the room

          glimpse the foot of the bed its mussed blanket and sheets
          jonathan gets to his feet starts for the bed his breath
          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket
          panicked he rushes forward to find blood soaking the bed
          splattered all over the crumpled sheets
          jonathan gapes horrified the world crashing in on him just
          as he senses something behind him and bang!                      something hits
          him to the back of the head  he goes down like a sack of
          potatoes

          back in the room he tries the closets empty the connecting
          door between this room and the next locked
          he looks to where shed draped her clothes and bag  every
          trace of her is gone he whips back to the bed  the sheets
          are still crumpled only theres no blood an here on them
          he runs to the window looks down at the street its four in

          tripping over his own legs jonathan runs barefoot down the
          corridor he rounds a corner another stretch of narrow
          corridor os we hear the muted ding of an elevator
          jonathan tears off in its direction
          he stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
          located he crushes the down button peers up to the floor
          indicator overhead 4 slowly creeps to 3

          their grasp on the railing  he tumbles head first crashing
          to the 2nd floor landing he clutches his head gets up and
          continues to dash down

          he becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy  when a
          cell phone rings its russos she pauses struck by the
          genuine desperation in jonathans face she finally picks up

          able to contain his devastation

          jonathan

          an awkward silence then

          russo

          items she 
          corrects herself
           the items you claim were stolen
          jonathan shakes his head crushed and exasperated

          the elevator descends with an unnerving rattle as jonathan
          rides down with russo

          her purse was recovered from a dumpster
          about a block away so weve got a name

          russo
          mr messer
          he tries to speak but can hardly breathe let alone answer

          russo
          was this the woman you were with last
          night
          she frowns suspicious of jonathans hesitation his tense
          eyes whip across the morgue the two cops still idling there
          theyre out of earshot but their mere presence amps tension
          angle on the guns in their holsters the handcuffs dangling

          russo
          i figured it was a long shot the only

          couple sit side by side her headon his shoulder on
          jonathans face theres a sense of loss that is almost
          overwhelming
          jonathan takes the crinkled chinese gum wrapper from his
          pocket smoothes it in his hands stares down at it with a
          look of longing
           when his eyes suddenly widen he sees something inside
          something he hadnt noticed he unfolds it to reveal two
          words written in a feminine hand on the white underside
          im sorry
          jonathan quickly looks up as if expecting someone else to
          share in this haunting discovery of course no one does
          he stares back down at it bewildered stunned  chilled

          intensely preoccupied jonathan walks alone past assistants
          and execs in his eyes a sense of paranoia a mistrust of
          every strange face

          int a conference room  night

          isolated behind yet another wall of glass jonathan just
          stares blearyeyed at his laptop unable to work

          ext clute nichols building  night

          jonathan exits starts toward the sidewalk  but hears
          something sandpaper shuffle of shoes on pavement be spins     
          no one there just one of many large stone pillars adorning
          the building jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar
          wavering he steps closer trying to glimpse behind it 
          ring! of his cellphone breaks the stillness ring ring
          he catches his breath quickly picks up a silent beat

          are you free tonight hello
          he hangs up chilled turns again to the pillar steps closer
           no sound he hesitates then turns and walks off

          int times square subway station  night

          people heading home from work jonathan among them utterly
          desolate sliding his metrocard he suddenly feels watched
          again he spins peers anxiously behind him only strange
          faces passing through turnstiles

          int subway station  corridor

          a narrow curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti
          jonathan keeps a quick pace feeling vulnerable
          we lag back following him from an anonymous pov glance up
          at a sign for stairs to the n & r trains

          int subway platform

          jonathan is waiting for his train eyes nervously glancing
          around still feeling watched 
          when he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the
          opposite platform waiting for a train she casually turns
          her head and jonathans eyes go wide

          continued

          continued
          its s
          jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks
          he cant believe hes seeing her again
           when she starts to back away almost as if she might run
          confused jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform

          jonathan
          wait! wait right there!
          jonathan stands on the edge reeling desperate to getto her
          he looks around hears the distant nimble of afar off train
          and suddenly he does something wed have never thought him
          capable of he jumps onto the tracks!
          he lands hard nearly breaking his ankle but quickly
          scrambles to his feet splashing in the sludge between rails
          eyes darting along the track anxious to avoid the third
          rail ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
          races for

          the center divider
          he reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up
          he gets to his feet on the center divider  now only one lane
          of track separating him from the platform she was standing on
           only shes no longer there
          he scans the people waiting no sign of s among them  and
          then suddenly he spots her heading for the exits

          jonathan

          stop!
          she glances back utterly stunned to find jonathan standing
          on the center divider feet soaked in muck
          neither speaks for a moment just staring at each other
          across the solitary track then

          jonathan
          i thought you were dead!
          she looks like she wants to say something but doesnt and
          all at once hes hit with a crushing realization

          jonathan
          you are in on this arent you!
          she holds his eyes a moment longer fighting back emotion 
          then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again

          steal his wallet

          but looks like she could break down at any moment

          âsâ
          he asked if i wanted to make some real
          money all i had to do was get involved
          with you and not ask any questions
          jonathan just stares devastated

          jonathan

          she fights back tears

           when the incoming train completely drowns him out and
          swipes s out of jonathans view
          jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its
          passengers prevent him from getting a look at her just then
          the train doors open with the noise of passengers getting on
          and off panicked jonathan cranes his neck trying to see
          her through the windows

          jonathan

          the rear observation window her hand pressed to the pane
          her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye
          he stumbles to a devastated halt eyes pleading vainly as he

          one of our chicago partnersa man named
          holloway thats how i met him
          tight on jonathan as we smash to

          int expensive chicago restaurant  night

          a slightly older man                                            holloway sits with his back to us
          across from him sits black business suit a younger man steps
          into frame rests his hand on holloways shoulder

          black business suit                                             v0
          at first i assumed he was a junior
          executive at their firm but he wasnt
          thats not to say he didnt work for
          holloway but clearly in a more intimate
          capacity

          tnt the michelangelo  room  night
          black business suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette

          black business suit
          i wasnt shocked besides obviously im
          no prude even back then id been doing 
          you know this thing  for a while

          int expensive chicago restaurant  night

          wyatt is talking entertaining his two companions  but
          clearly more focused on black business suit flirting it up

          black business suit                                             v0
          i was simply curious more so when he
          apologized explaining that hed forgotten
          about another engagement
          wyatts knuckles just barely stroke black business suits
          thigh as he rises to leave they exchange a knowing glance

          continued

          back to michelangelo room

          black business suit
          i was intrigued he was intelligent
          informed about everything from law to art
          to politics id never met anyone so in
          command of his own charm he said that
          hed come from nothing that everything he
          learned he learned from his tricks he
          claimed that holloway was even grooming
          him for a position at his company
          she lights another cigarette with her old one

          black business suit
          in a way i felt for him but i also
          admired him it sounds silly but he had a
          way of making me feel  close to him you
          know
          this clearly hits home with jonathan he barely nods

          black business suit
          so i found myself telling him things
          personal things and next thing i knew 

          jonathan
          you told him about this
          a beat and she nods crushing out her other cigarette

          black business suit
          he seemed fascinated by it wanted to know
          all the details

          exhales
          i suppose id had too much to drink and i
          was distracted i was thinking about
          what a great lay he was going to be

          int four seasons chicago suite bedroom  late night

          wyatt and black business suit go at it with animal
          aggression shes on all fours arching lustily pleasure
          nearly unbearable eyes clenched shut as she climaxes
          exhausted her body goes limp
          tilt up to his face an eerily blank driven stare devoid of
          real pleasure she struggles tries to protest  when his
          hands grip her shoulder blades thrusting harder violently
          pinning her down her sudden fear stifled by the mattress 

          int the michelangelo  room  night

          close on black business suit staring off chilled by memory

          phone of course i couldnt say anything
          to holloway and jamie must have known id
          never report it to the police

          beat
          so i just put the incident out of my mind
          i all but forgot about it until one
          night maybe two months ago 

          int the warwick nyc                                          lobby  night

          did i suddenly felt very very scared

          she looks around at the room the bed she shudders rises

          utterly bare empty walls expensive views polished wood
          floors jonathan takes a wary step inside leaning to peer
          around the corners
          he paces cautiously through the living room the dining area
          the glistening chrome and granite kitchen

          the bedroom
          a room as empty as the others  with the exception of a small
          pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner jonathan
          slowly nearsto find its a stack of mail he picks up an
          envelope  os the creak of a door hinge
          jonathan whips around  no one behind him he steps out of
          the room to investigate
          we remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat
          until jonathan finally steps back in only slightly at
          ease he returns to the stack of mail picks up an envelope
          he reads mr jonathan messer 140 e                           91    st
          eyes wide he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail 
          all addressed to him at this address
          jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief when he
          finds at the bottom of the stack another photograph its of
          s standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
          track from jonathan and suddenly jonathan is gripped with
          fear unaware of a blurred nearing intruder

          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed

          his eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions to
          laptop screen to glass wall  fingers typing all the while
          he finally reaches a prompt bienvenue pour anglais cboisez p2
          we glimpse a small logo with a swiss flag
          jonathan presses f2 reads some more types some more
          finally we read enter subaccount number

          the cursoron the laptop screen the icon blinking
          petulantly hes about to type
          and then he halts his eyes drifting to his cell phone
          resting in its charger
          tighter on jonathan his eyes fixed on the cell phone an
          idea forming in his mind 
          ring!! of the cell phone suddenly jars us ring jonathan
          hesitates then picks up

          close on jonathans laptop screen as it defuzzes from sleep
          the screen as it was cursor blinking by the request for an
          access code
          wyatt watches intensely as jonathan starts to type  then
          pauses looking confused
          jonathan quickly reaches around to the back of his laptop
          feels an empty jack  and suddenly turns pale

          jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907
          he takes out his key card about to slide it in the slot 
          when a hand grabs his forearm! he spins in panic to 
           a cleaning woman she says somethingin vietnamese
          indicating the ringing alarms

           when a second shot rings out the bullet punching a dent
          into the underside of the stairs just overhead
          on wyatt realizing he needs a cleaner shot taking the
          stairs even harder in pursuit all merciless intensity

          ext hotel rooftop  moments later

          the party is still at full throttle apparently no one has
          yet told them of the alarms
          close on a stairwell door marked emergency exit as it
          suddenly bangs open and jonathan and s spill out
          they pause a moment  thrown by the sight of all the wealthy
          beautiful faces laughing dancing

          jonathan
          come on!
          she grabs his hand and they waste no time disappearing into
          the mass of bodies
          they keep moving shoulder to shoulder within the swell of
          partiers they fit right in  instantly anonymous                 though
          not as smartly attired
          back to the stairwell door as wyatt enters the party
          scanning the dense crowd all senses alert
          insert wyatts pov just a mass of successful attractive
          partying young men and women theres no way to pick jonathan
          and s out
          wyatts smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the
          periphery
          within the crowd s clutches jonathans hand their heads
          ducked low as they press forward
          close on wyatt frustration gnashing at him as he quickens
          his pace the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him
          sweat beading on his face                                        
           when suddenly the music stops wyatt frowns eyes darting
          close on jonathan and s glancing around in confusion 

          security                                                         distant us

          continued
          the crowd noise resumes as the throngs begrudgingly start
          for the exits
          on jonathan and s doing their best to stay concealed
          within the exiting crowd
          angle on wyatt pushing his way through the crush shoving
          people aside trying to find them 
           when he suddenly stops he has an idea he takes out his
          cell phone
          back to jonathan and 5 within the crowd 
           when jonathans cell phone rings
          close on jonathan as his eyes widen in panic
          ring he quickly fumbles for it tries to turn it off        
           but its too late whip across the crowd to wyatt
          grinning wider hes spotted them in an instant he is bee
          lining through the packed suits
          wide shot of the rooftop as the throngs are clearing out
          jonathan grabs s as they duck racing across the dark
          rooftop looking for a place to hide
          they take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge 
          gasping to catch their breath stepping back ss foot
          clinks against something a stray iron railing post
          she reaches down for it starts to lift it 
           when wyatts hand darts in and grasps the other end
          she looks up in terror  when wyatt punches her violently
          knocking her to the ground
          jonathan rushes to her  only to be blocked by wyatt
          gripping the iron rod tight

          wyatt
          nice try back there jonathan looks like
          you picked up a thing or two from me
          jonathan tries to strike him  when with a lightning quick
          movement wyatt whips the iron rod through the air cracking
          jonathan across the face

          wyatt
          killer instinct pall

          continued
          jonathan crumples his glasses knocked to the ground
          close on wyatt as he grips the iron rod like a tennis
          racquet steps into position                                   
           and brings the rod down on jonathan with ruthless tennis
          strokes backhand! bam! forehand! bam! slice! bam!
          jonathan can barely peer up bloody and beaten he hears
          wyatt drop the iron rod


          jonathans pov wyatts blurry figure hovering above suddenly
          swoops in on us  
                                              
           as wyatt grabs jonathan by the throat hefts him up and
          yanks him back to the roofs concrete ledge jonathan fights
          to struggle free  when wyatt jams the gun under his chin
          jonathan freezes

          jonathan

          gasping
          theyll catch you

          wyatt

          im a tourist just passing through
          jonathans pov wyatts face presses closer now almost in
          focus as he presses jonathans torso back over the ledge 

          wyatt
          as for you you had your fun
          wyatt presses closer crushing jonathans back to the edge

          wyatt
          now were going to go back down
          insert jonathans hand reaching into wyatts pocket his
          fingers fumbling for the cell phone                            jonathans old phone

          wyatt
          were going to get that laptop
          close on jonathans fingers blindly prodding  he has the
          phone now  his fingers feel for the antenna

          wyatt
          and were going to finish this once and
          for 
           when with all his strength jonathan jams the cell phone up
          into wyatts eye the antenna punching into the retina

          continued
          wyatts grasp slips from jonathans collar as he stumbles
          back cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his gun toward
          jonathan 
           when with every ounce of strength jonathan charges wyatts
          shot missing him as jonathan slams him into the ledge wall
          seizing the momentum to turn himself 
           as wyatt falls right over the edge of the hotel rooftop

          ext the plaza hotel                                             wide shot

          wyatts body plummeting down the magnificent facade
          vanishing into the vastness of the city below

          ext rooftop

          close on jonathan as he crawls to the ledge peers down into
          the darkness he exhales then turns back to s                 
           to find shes right beside him grateful tears in her eye
          she leans into him and he holds her tight the two of them
          embraced on the precipice as we

          dissolve to

          ext plaza hotel  street level  short time later

          strobed reds and blues of police and firetrucks amassed
          trying to control the throngs of guests and pedestrians
          blocking our view of the body theyre all gawking at
          we travel through the confusion until we find jonathan and
          s sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb each propped
          against the other
          the shock of it all is beginning to fade he reaches into his
          pocket and hands her duck on bike

          jonathan

          she winds the toy up they watch it make its funny way down
          the sidewalk

          jonathan

          she nods

          and whispers the answer in his ear jonathan gazes at her a
          moment  whatever her name is it must be perfect

          jonathan
          so what now
          she smiles up at him

          s

          perhaps for the first time in his life

          jonathan

          they gaze at each other
          we leave jonathan and s to their privacy pulling back as
          they continue talking continuing away until were

          through a window and inside the hotel itself
          the window itself now a frame letterboxing the scene
          people passing like fish in their tank except for jonathan
          and s seated centerframe two small figures side by side
          face to face talking intimately as we

          fade out


                                      the end
