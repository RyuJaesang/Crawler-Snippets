       late spring 1957

       opening credits roll over a tent montage  assorted
       angles of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
       striped bigtop style canvas tent including the long
       steel stakes being sledgehammered into the lawn
       practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines the tall
       center poles being leveraged upright the heavy rolledup
       sections of canvas being maneuvered into position and
       ending with the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
       tent assumes its full and finished form

       way to school jacey is seventeen hes as handsome and
       seemingly selfconfident as his younger brother is
       rumpled and impulsive doug is fifteen a popular
       culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
       affectations of whomever his hero is at the moment
       which presently happens to be elvis presley

       jacey stops and stares with openfaced misery at the tent
       on the abbotts front yard the installation of the tent
       indicates that the abbotts are having yet another of the
       many parties they throw every year

    helen holt is seated at the dining table she was
    grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
    jacey and doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
    matter at hand she is an attractive but unostentatious
    woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
    than what she is a fortyoneyearold widow raising two
    teenage sons on a school teachers salary she teaches
    second grade at haley elementary school

                            jacey
              he has to wash it off mother
              you cannot let him go to the party
              unless he washes it off

                            doug
              itll look worse if i wash it
              its india ink itll turn gray
              itll look like dirt

                            jacey

              doesnt even know it! he doesnt
              get how things work in this town
              i thought you werent even going
              to the party

                            doug
              changed my mind

                            helen
              doug you do understand that you
              may be the only person at this
              party with artificial sideburns

                            doug
              yeah

                            helen
              you do understand that your
              sideburns dont look real

    doug was hoping they didnt look that phony but he
    conceals his disappointment and nods

       the curb is lined with parked cars we hear a dance band
       playing que sera and the sounds of the party as doug
       lopes up the sidewalk sporting his india ink sideburns
       and smoking a cigarette he flicks the cigarette into
       the street with wellrehearsed ease as he turns and walks
       up the long driveway towards the glowing bigtop tent
       doug trails his hand over lloyd abbotts cadillac
       caressing it from hoodtotrunk as he ambles by

       doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering  a
       tuxedoed tenpiece band plays on the bandstand

       despite his mothers advice a nauseated grimace falls
       over jaceys face when he sees that his younger brother
       has arrived he is dancing with eleanor

                                                     continued

       they dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
       jaceys senior classmates they are all edgy with envy
       waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
       eleanor

                               eleanor
                 im going out to the lake
                 tomorrow sandy wants to showoff

                               eleanor
                 well i guess youll just have to
                 write me a letter

                               jacey
                 what do you mean

                 in private

                 chance to be together alone you
                 know

       steve one of the envious classmates makes his move and
       cuts in on jacey and dances away with eleanor jacey
       handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
       separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
       he observes eleanor flirting with her new dance partner

     wife joan abbott step up onto the bandstand joan has

     assignments eleanor is seemingly oblivious to dougs
     probing eyes

     doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table
     he ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his
     ruse is revealed as he stares up eleanors skirt at the
     soft triangle that her white panties cover between her
     parted legs eleanors hand lowers a piece of notebook
     paper beneath the table on it she has written hi
     doug!

     doug starts with panic rears back cracks his head on
     the bottom of the table and then as his head rebounds
     from the blow he accidentally impales himself in his
     chin with the sharp pencil doug scrambles up from under
     the table with the pencil dangling from his chin
     knocking over his chair in the process the tranquility
     of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted
     reactions of the students eleanor is momentarily
     concerned about his welfare but she cannot help but
     laugh too

               both

     doug exhales with bewilderment stubs out his cigarette
     then awkwardly slides down the sofa to pamela she holds
     perfectly still as doug slowly moves his mouth to hers
     and kisses her then he concludes the kiss to check her
     reaction she timidly smiles he kisses her again with
     greater fervor doug creeps his hand up her blouse and
     massages her breast pamela struggles to suppress her
     surprise which he mistakes as a sign of her approval
     emboldened by her lack of resistance he slips his hand
     under her bra pam is shocked by the pleasure of the
     sensation then alarmed by the pace of their passion

                              pamela
               doug

     doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a
     framed photograph of eleanor amongst an assortment of
     family photos on the long table behind the sofa it is
     eleanor that he is thinking of  in his minds eye it is
     eleanors breast that he is fondling pamela pulls her
     lips from his

                                                    continued

                   do you love me doug   do you

         he kisses her with such ardor that she   interprets his
         answer to be yes when in reality doug   is only trying to
         silence her he pulls his hand out of    her blouse and
         slips it under her skirt pam lurches    back into the
         sofa

                                 pamela

                   stop it stop it!

         she shoves him away and jumps off the sofa doug looks
         at her with breathless confusion she turns away from
         him and tries to button her blouse but she cant see the
         buttons for her tears she begins to sob and runs out of
         the room

         he slowly mounts the stairs wary of invading pamelas
         privacy anymore than he already has

     aware of him but pretends that she isnt doug
     hesitates as if he might say something to her but loses
     his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway pams
     disappointment is plain to see

     doug doesnt notice eleanor and a few of her girl friends
     approaching in the opposite direction as they pass him
     eleanor smiles brightly and says

     doug allows pam to pull him out onto the dance floor he
     feels like a dolt but she arranges his hands on her and
     they begin to dance she gazes into his eyes and smiles

                             pamela

     pam is in love with doug she has been since they were
     children doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for
     her for a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble
     of true affinity but their bubble begins to deflate as
     doug sees joan abbott staring at them her disapproval
     is unmistakable doug steers pam around the dance floor
     to avoid joans eyes but then he sees lloyd abbott
     lloyds stare is even more discomforting pamela senses
     the change in dougs mood but she is unaware of the
     cause

                             pamela
               is jacey home for the summer or is
               he just here for a visit

               its cheaper if he stays here for

     alice tries to quiet her crying eighteenmonthold
     daughter susan lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to
     alice and she rises and carries susan up the aisle

     commencement is over  the parking lot is a sea of cars
     slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating
     graduates beaming parents and rambunctious siblings

     as helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly
     ambushed by three second grade students of hers she
     has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on

     helen finds herself facetoface with lloyd abbott as
     they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between
     two parked vehicles they are both caught offguard 
     there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each
     other

     so that she can get into the plymouth doug is already in

               hypocritical its insincere
               people should do and say exactly
               what they feel or think and not
               try to hide things

      he escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions
      her center stage near the footlights

                              doug
                just stand right there

      he takes the work light with him as he walks off stage
      then with a metallic clank everything goes dark

                               pamela
                        alarmed

                its all right  dont move!
                stay put

      theres the rumble and squeak of a piece of scenery being
      rolled onto stage  then the swoosh of a backdrop being
      lowered from the fly loft

                              doug os
                almost almost hold on

      we hear doug running somewhere backstage then a beautiful
      sunset slowly illuminates the stage  creating the
      perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that
      doug has put into place it is the roof of a weathered
      farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney
      doug steps on stage hes a bit winded from his quick
      change routine

                              pamela

                deal so theres this
                competition among all the theater

      doug spins and delivers a wild roundhouse punch that
      lands brutally on the side of jaceys face  the impact
      knocks him down onto the steps jaceys eyebrow has
      split open he is blinded by blood

      doug walks away leaving jacey sitting on the steps
      clutching a banister for support he presses his palm to
      his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood
