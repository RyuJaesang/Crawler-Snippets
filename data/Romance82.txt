                         going to live for a long time yet 
                         look bruce this is a debt of honor 
                         i was a very bad husband hildy could 
                         have got a lot of alimony if shed 
                         wanted to but she wouldnt take 
                         any she had it coming to her but 
                         she was too independent

                         so that the money wont mean anything 
                         but suppose you havent made good  
                         dont you think hildys entitled to 
                         a quiet old age without any worries

               at the door of earl williams cell hildy sits on a stool at 
               the door pencil and copy paper in hand earl williams sits 
               at the edge of his cot facing hildy there is a bouquet of 
               roses in a water pitcher by the cot our first impression of 
               williams is that hes a rational wellpoised citizen it is 
               only under hildys questioning that he gradually reveals 
               himself

                                     williams
                         i couldnt plead insanity because 
                         you see im just as sane as anybody 
                         else

                                     hildy
                              puzzled and worried
                         you didnt mean to kill that 
                         policeman

                                     williams
                         of course not i couldnt kill anybody  
                         its against everything ive ever 
                         stood for they know it was an 
                         accident theyre not hanging me for 
                         that  theyre hanging me for my 
                         beliefs

                                     hildy
                         what are your beliefs earl

                                     williams
                         theyre very simple i believe in 
                         the golden rule im not the first 
                         man to die for preaching it but if 
                         they would only listen to it  we 
                         could have a fine decent world 
                         instead of this mass of hate that 
                         makes man do such cruel things

                                     hildy
                         how would you go about applying the 
                         golden rule earl

                                     williams
                         id do away with the profit system 
                         and have production for use only 
                         theres enough food and clothing and 
                         shelter for everybody if wed use 
                         some sense

                         production for use only well 
                         maybe thats the answer

                                     williams
                         its the only answer everything has 
                         a use and if we let it be used for 
                         its purpose we could solve all our 
                         problems food was meant to be eaten 
                         not stored away in restaurants while 
                         poor people starved clothing was 
                         meant to be worn not piled up in 
                         stores while people went naked 
                         doesnt that make sense

               he suddenly realizes what hes said and sprints for the door 
               hildy chucks something at him it just misses as he ducks 
               out of the door

               med shot another angle

               hildy casts a savage look after the departed louie takes 
               another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to 
               dial

                                     hildy

                         27th precinct station house

               hildy stops short arrested by a sound from the open window 
               she turns and sees earl williams looking more inoffensive 
               and exhausted than ever indeed on the verge of collapse he 
               carries a large revolver the searchlights that have been 
               playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again

                              pointing gun at her
                         drop that phone 

               hildy drops the phone back on the hook

                                     williams
                              supporting himself 
                              by holding on to 
                              edge of desk
                         youre not going to phone anybody 
                         where i am

                                     hildy
                              bracing herself
                         put down that gun earl

               he advances steadily toward hildy the gun aimed at her

                                     hildy

                         use

               hildy starts walking toward him slowly

                                     hildy
                         earl you dont want to hurt your

               hildy stops

                                     williams

                         wouldnt want to do that would you

                                     williams

                         to kill anybody all i want to do is 
                         be let alone

               hildy sneaks another step forward

                                     hildy
                         earl theres just one thing i ought 
                         to clear up for the interview

                         too near i dont trust anybody

                         i dont blame you earl
                              another step forward
                         if i were in your place i wouldnt 
                         trust anybody either

                                     williams
                              suddenly
                         keep away!

               he points the gun at hildy pulls the trigger and we hear a 
               faint click!

                                     williams
                              weakly
                         i guess i used all the shells

               close two shot

               he drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for 
               support hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side 
               of the desk for support and at this moment she looks more 
               tired than he does she looks at earl and breathes heavily

                                     hildy
                         earl you must never do that again

                                     williams
                         oh im awful tired i couldnt go 
                         through another day like this

                              now
                         well maybe you think i could!

               camera follows her as she retrieves the gun and jams it in 
               her purse jumps to the windows pulls down the shades

                                     earls voice

                         gun

               hildy crosses swiftly to the door locks it and puts out the 
               lights so that they are visible only faintly in the light 
               from the areaway

                                     hildy

                         me i done my best

               he abruptly crumples and falls to the floor hildy stands 
               for a second desperate then she picks him up and half 
               carries half drags him over toward a chair and places him 
               in it then she makes a quick dash for her phone
