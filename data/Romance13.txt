               fade in

               ext central park  september afternoon

               a couple moves down a walkway deep in subdued conversation 
               all around them trees explode with autumn color birds sing 
               their path is dappled with leafy shadow

               to their left on the sunny meadow teenagers throw saucers 
               and footballs smoke cigarettes and joints drink beer and 
               soda savoring the waning hours of summer

               closer on the couple

               he is wills keane late 40s to early 50s strikingly 
               handsome impeccably dressed and supremely poised at first 
               glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war 
               against time has been the undisputed victor

               only a closer look hints at the toll of battle his shoulders 
               strain under the weight of so much repetition his eyes are 
               touched by regret the lines in his face reveal an emerging 
               disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself

               walking at his side is a woman 30 attractive and bright 
               her name is unimportant because so many have come before her 
               and if the past prevails so many will come after

               she listens intently as wills finishes speaking 

                                     wills
                          and i could have waited to tell 
                         you but i wanted to leave no room 
                         for misunderstanding

                                     woman
                         well you certainly didnt

               ext another central park walkway  later

               still talking quietly they pass into a more secluded area 
               of the park

                                     woman
                         no i see how you could feel this 
                         way of course i do its human but 
                         what i dont get is why youd want 
                         to announce it so quickly i mean 
                         we just met feelings change you 
                         dont even know me

                                     wills
                         yes i do

               she is amused by his confidence 

                                     woman
                         oh really

                                     wills
                         the minute i laid eyes on you its 
                         the saddest thing about getting older 
                         you know people so quickly i even 
                         knew youd end up hating me

                                     woman
                         well youre wrong i dont

                                     wills
                              with a weary smile
                         give it time

               she laughs then he stops he hears something she stops 
               she hears it too its a girls voice he casually turns 
               and looks squinting into the sun

               he takes a few steps and there between trees he sees two 
               dozen people sitting on the grass and on folding chairs  
               most are middleaged or older with a distinctly intellectual
               bohemian look to them

               standing and addressing them is charlotte fielding 19 fair 
               willowy pale lovely in an unconventional way she wears an 
               eccentric hat and a vintage dress her bearing is upright 
               her gaze warm and intelligent her voice rich with emotion 

                                     charlotte
                          and for weeks i sat by her bed 
                         and cried i told her i loved her 
                         and i begged her not to leave me 
                         all i could think about was what id 
                         lose if she died and then one 
                         night she was in really bad pain 
                         i stopped thinking about myself for 
                         a second and i thought about her
                              fighting tears
                         i stopped crying i said goodbye 
                         and in less than an hour ella was 
                         gone

               the woman whispers in wills ear 

                                     woman
                         its so sad

               but wills ignores her he watches charlotte with keen 
               interest touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion

                                     charlotte
                         i really think its possible to hold 
                         a person back cry them back 
                         from dying thats what i did to 
                         ella and ill never do it to anyone 
                         else again
                              softly
                         i hope no one ever does it to me

               she looks out at the group many of whom are crying a tear 
               runs down her cheek she smiles and wipes it away

               the woman seeing wills interest in the girl whispers 

                                     woman
                         so what do you know about her

               he knows a great deal or at least he thinks he does but 
               his answer is nonchalant 

                                     wills
                         that shes just a kid

               he takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away 
               he steals one last look back

               charlotte returning to where she was sitting notices wills 
               their eyes meet and a charge passes between them

               meanwhile an old man has risen from his chair 

                                     old man
                         i met ella at city college in 1938

               boxes and shopping bags carrying an antique woodandwire

               charlotte wearily hauls the mannequin across the cobblestone 
               street over the curb and up to the stoop of a charming but 
               slightly dilapidated brownstone

               int brownstone foyer  dusk

               a waiter carrying a birthday cake  blazing with candles 
               and decorated with a womans hat made of meringue latticework  
               passes by on his way to the rear dining room

               from inside voices begin to sing happy birthday wills his 
               curiosity piqued follows

               int rear dining room  continuous

               theres a cheer and applause as the song ends wills cannot 
               see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view

               just as wills is about to exit the room the waiter steps 
               away wills glances over and sees the birthday girl at first 
               he cant place her but then he does and his face softens 
               and brightens

               its charlotte she wears a black velvet dress and a 
               wonderfully eccentric hat her eyes glow in the candlelight 
               through the chorus of voices urging her to make a wish she 
               cries out 

                                     charlotte

               charlotte blows hard and with a little more effort than 
               you might expect extinguishes the candles everyone applauds 
               and cheers

               to charlottes right sits simon loring late 20s english 
               sardonic adoring he gestures at her chest and says

               more laughter

               back to wills he considers approaching charlotte but then 
               he looks back and sees eriko sitting alone at their table 
               idly stabbing at her drink with a straw

               regretting his rudeness he takes a step toward her but 
               then hears 

                                     womans voice
                         is that wills keane

               as he hugs dolores he cant help but look over at charlotte 
               again

                                     dolly

               on charlotte she looks over her view is such that she sees 
               wills but not dolores

               a faint blush creeps into charlottes cheeks she pretends 
               to listen as shannon tells a story 

                                     shannon

               noticing charlottes distraction simon whispers calmly to 
               her 

                                     simon
                         are you feeling all right you look 
                         positively green

               charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips 

                                     charlotte
                         hes here and hes staring at me 
                         again

                                     shannon
                         no way!

               both shannon and simon turn to look but like lightning 
               charlotte grabs them both 

                                     charlotte
                         dont!
                              to simon
                         wait a few seconds then go to the 
                         bathroom

                                     simon

                         if hes rich you might have a fight 
                         on your hands

               charlotte watches furtively as simon rises from his chair 
               and walks over as he passes wills he flashes him a seductive 
               smile wills is confused by it

                                     charlotte
                         okay look

               shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof vacant stare 
               in wills direction then she looks back at charlotte mouth 
               agape 

                                     shannon

               charlotte laughs

               back on wills he does his best to be attentive as dolores 
               exhales a plume of smoke into his face 

                                     dolly
                         sure las okay if youre a cactus 
                         or a lizard but if youre a new

                         blows away like a god damn leaf

                                     wills
                         it only took me twenty years to come 
                         to my senses

                                     dolly

               charlotte looks over and pales her eyes widening

               a cocktail watching a daytime talk show

               in the background we see charlotte working in the adjoining 
               dining room which she has turned into a lovely sewing room

               closer on charlotte she builds her hat on a hat block  a

               up a text book with a yellow highlighter

               charlotte stops and rubs her eyes then she glances down at 
               shannon and smiles 

                                     charlotte

               shannon rolls over and looks at her suddenly her expression 
               is inexplicably solemn 

                                     shannon

                         what do you think

               she models the hat tears well in shannons eyes and she 
               says without even a hint of irony or sentimentality 

                                     shannon

               she takes a lovely old hat box out of the garbage bag and 
               ditches the bag under the table then she quickly checks

                         cook and sew speak italian 
                         basically enjoy life have fun  
                         thats what she was best at even 
                         when she knew she was dying
                              pause
                         the most important thing she did was 
                         introduce me to poetry she believed 
                         it was the highest form of art and 
                         that everything we say and do should 
                         aspire to it

               wills is uncomfortable for a moment then ventures quietly 

                                     wills
                         it sounds as though in a way she 
                         took your moms place

                                     charlotte
                         my mom and my dads after they died 
                         dolly was so devastated she pretty 
                         much gave up on everything it was 
                         like if something that tragic could 
                         happen there was no way she was 
                         ever gonna care about anyone else 
                         ever again including herself she 
                         wasnt a horrible parent she didnt 
                         abuse me or anything she just 
                         ignored me she was more like a weird 
                         landlady than a grandmother

               charlotte smiles sadly her eyes glisten in the light

                                     wills
                         im sure she did the best she could

                                     charlotte
                         for a long time i kinda thought that 
                         too and i made excuses for her but 
                         now i dont i was seven years old 
                         and i needed her and she wasnt there

               silence as wills somberly reflects finally he speaks 

                                     wills
                         i remember when i heard the news 
                         about your parents you know how 
                         after a crash they print a long list 
                         of names in the newspaper well i 
                         grew up outside boston so i naturally 
                         started to scan the list but 
                         casually not expecting to 

               suddenly a swing song starts wills smiles at the ironic 
               change of mood then turns to escort charlotte away 

                                     charlotte
                         oh no come on! i love this stuff! 
                         dont you didnt you grow up on it

                                     wills
                         how old do you think i am

                                     charlotte
                         ancient!

               holding his hand she starts moving to the music wills laughs 

                                     wills
                         i have no idea what to do!

                                     charlotte
                         have fun!

               she flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing wills 
               charmed senseless finally surrenders

               a sequence begins during which we see wills and charlotte 
               having an inordinately good time wills maintains a modicum 
               of reserve charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed

               certain guests notice them the reactions to their pairing 
               runs from confusion to disgust to amusement

               but no one watches them more carefully than lisa

               finally in the middle of a song wills and charlotte make 
               their way off the floor winded and laughing wills heads 
               off to the bar charlotte turns around and watches the other 
               dancers

               then we notice lisa standing next to her they smile at each 
               other lisa offers her a cocktail napkin charlotte takes it 
               and wipes off her brow

               they speak above the music 

                                     lisa
                         i had to come i work at the met

                                     lisa
                         with wills keane right

                                     charlotte

                                     lisa
                         just by reputation

                                     charlotte
                         a major womanizer right

                                     lisa

                         charlotte fielding

               they shake hands lisa looks away and sees wills making his 
               way toward them with two glasses of punch

               coolly covering lisa beats a hasty retreat 

                                     lisa
                         anyway i should keep mingling but 
                         it was nice to meet you

                                     charlotte
                         same here

               lisa smiles politely and walks away

               wills walks up watching lisa melt into the crowd his brow 
               is furrowed hes wondering if his eyes have deceived him 
               he hands charlotte a punch 

                                     wills
                         who was that

                                     charlotte
                         lisa something

               the name hits home wills is flustered but then he covers 
               as best he can and lifts his glass 

                                     wills
                              lifting his glass

                                     charlotte
                         us

               wills smiles slowly and they toast

               int wills living room  night

               the room is empty theres laughter in the distance the 
               front door opens and shuts we hear wills and charlotte 
               both a little tipsy advancing down the hall toward us 

                                     charlotte
                         god you talk like youre a hundred 
                         and sixteen!

                                     wills
                         thats usually how i feel but not 
                         tonight tonight i feel sixteen 
                         just sixteen and threequarters

               wills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator pulls 
               out a bottle of champagne already sitting in an ice bucket

                                     wills
                         champagne

                                     charlotte
                         he asked nonchalantly

               wills laughs then opens the bottle as he picks up his 
               previous train of thought 

                                     wills
                         you see charlotte the way you know 
                         youre getting older is that you 
                         start to notice patterns people 
                         start falling into types pretty 
                         soon you know a person before youve 
                         even been introduced and if its a 
                         woman before the romance even starts 
                         a whisper in your head tells you 
                         exactly what it is and how long its 
                         going to last and the saddest the 
                         most tedious part of all is that 
                         that little voice is almost always 
                         right
                              popping the cork
                         now what i like about you  and i 
                         think thats actually what inspired 
                         this little lecture  is that i 
                         find you completely unprecedented 
                         and therefore wholly unpredictable

                                     charlotte
                         god it must be a relief

                                     wills
                              confused
                         what

                                     charlotte
                         to finally deliver that speech to a 
                         woman and actually have it apply to 
                         her

                                     wills
                         now wait a minute

                                     charlotte
                         no because coincidentally i am all 
                         those things you just said and more

               wills chuckles shaking his head charmed but a little 
               unsettled

                                     charlotte
                         im a unique at least thats what 
                         my yoga teacher says he says there

                                     wills
                         well hes a wise man

               he hands her a glass of champagne

                                     charlotte
                         you on the other hand are what 
                         hed call a typical

                                     wills

                                     charlotte

                         to come here

               wills moves a few steps closer

                                     charlotte
                         closer

               wills walks even closer until they are just a few feet apart

                                     charlotte
                         no come on really close

               wills cant believe his good luck he nears her until their 
               faces are almost touching

                                     charlotte
                         perfect now watch very carefully

               she rises on tiptoe and puts her mouth just inches from his

               their breathing mingles wills seems almost dizzied by it

               and then very slowly he kisses her

               she does not kiss back

               finally he pulls away staring blankly breathing hard not 
               sure what to say

               charlotte whispers 

                                     charlotte
                         see youre a typical
                              pause
                         and for what you just did most girls 
                         my age would slap your face or ask 
                         to be put in a cab
                              pause
                         lucky for you im a unique

               she smiles then kisses him deeply on the mouth her arms 
               wrap around his neck

               int wills bedroom  night

               cloaked in deep shadow set off against a rainy window pane 
               we see wills his shirt off on top of charlotte whose blouse 
               is open he passionately kisses her neck and mouth

                                                               dissolve to

               int wills bedroom  morning

               the room is bathed in golden light charlotte lies naked 
               under the covers asleep on her stomach her brow is tense 
               and one of her hands is slightly clenched

               angle on wills standing in the doorway watching her his 
               face a portrait of conflicted thoughts

               finally she stirs smiling and squinting into the sun she 
               gets up on one arm and looks at him standing there in the 
               doorway 

                                     charlotte
                         boy do you look guilty

               ext wills terrace  later

               charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast wills 
               sits across from her watching and worrying

                                     charlotte
                         didnt anyone ever teach you that 
                         its bad manners to stare at a girl 
                         when shes eating like a pig

               wills chuckles then his smile fades and he clears his throat

                                     wills
                         listen 

                                     charlotte
                         uhoh here it comes

                                     wills
                         thats right because look i could 
                         put this off but i genuinely like 
                         you so i want to be clear right 
                         now from the start so theres no 
                         chance for misunderstanding later

                                     charlotte
                         okay

                                     wills

                         that all i can offer you is this 
                         what we have right now nothing 
                         more substantial just this

               charlotte gulps down the juice wills watches his mind 
               reeling

               int doctors office  day

               wills sits across from a large desk beneath a wall of framed 
               certificates and diplomas the door opens and dr paul sibley 
               60 africanamerican dour and forbidding enters 

                                     sibley

               wills jerks to his feet and they shake hands 

                                     wills
                         thank you so much for taking the 
                         time

                                     sibley
                         its my job sir please sit down

               he walks around the desk sibley is all business but his 
               brusqueness masks genuine regret 

                                     sibley
                         now mr keane on the phone you 
                         referred to charlottes condition as 
                         cancer that isnt strictly accurate 
                         neuroblastoma is a soft tissue 
                         malignancy but it isnt cancer  
                         although it sometimes can be just as 
                         aggressive
                              sitting
                         its most common in children in 
                         young adults the condition is 
                         extremely rare in charlottes case 
                         the tumor is located in her chest 
                         its growing rapidly and has proved 
                         resistant to both irradiation and 
                         chemotherapy and because of its 
                         proximity to her aorta surgery is 
                         out of the question

                                     wills
                         so then what treatment is she getting

                                     sibley
                         at present nothing

               wills shifts uneasily in his chair

                                     sibley
                         eventually shell be treated for 
                         pain in the end surgery could become 
                         an option but her chances of survival 
                         would be slim right now charlottes 
                         against it shes signed a directive 
                         forbidding any sort of heroic 
                         intervention

               a silence settles between them sibley opens a folder on his 
               desk

                                     sibley
                         theres more here if youre 
                         interested but it wont mean much 
                         to you

               wills shakes his head and rises from his chair he turns to 
               the door then turns back to the doctor

               sits on the couch doing the new york times crossword wills 
               emerges walking slowly pensively as though in a trance

               charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin 

                                     charlotte
                         a real charmer isnt he

               ignoring her wills sits down takes her in his arms and 
               embraces her at first she resists but slowly she surrenders 
               and hugs him back

               int taxi  afternoon

               as the cab bounces down a cobblestone village street wills 
               and charlotte stare straight ahead each following the 
               tortuous path of his own thoughts

               slowly charlotte steals a sidelong look at him his face is 
               tense ashen and unreadable 

                                     charlotte
                         hey

               wills slowly turns his head she smiles sweetly 

                                     charlotte
                         look on the bright side if i werent 
                         sick theres no way we could hang 
                         out together
                              off his look
                         im serious youd be scared of 
                         hurting me and id be scared you 
                         were just using me for my perfect 
                         young body

               he cant help but smile encouraged she moves closer 

                                     charlotte
                         and then our friends would say we 
                         were just into each other for weird 
                         psychological reasons you know 
                         because im looking for a daddy 
                         substitute and youre looking for 
                         someone you can feel superior to so 
                         you wont have to confront how scared 
                         you are of real intimacy  and of 
                         course theyd be right and eventually 
                         wed break up
                              beat
                         but since im so sick it doesnt 
                         really matter what deepseated 
                         weirdness has brought us together 
                         because theres no way we can possibly 
                         screw each other over or up 
                         because that takes time and i dont 
                         have much left

               the cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone she smiles 
               archly savoring the irony 

                                     charlotte
                         so considering everything dont you 
                         think we should just sort of chill 
                         out forget im sick and enjoy what 
                         we have right now no strings 
                         just this until it ends cause 
                         thats really all i have to offer

               wills grimly appreciates the irony

                                     charlotte
                         think about it okay but not too 
                         hard

               she kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab she skips up 
               the steps of the brownstone then immediately turns around 
               and runs back down to the open window

               she leans in and mutters sexily 

                                     charlotte
                         last night was so incredibly hot

                         and i picked you for the job i hope 
                         youre flattered

               wills is shocked she turns and runs back upstairs she sticks 
               in the key then turns and waves at wills before banging 
               open the door with her hip

               buried in a book utterly uninterested

                in elysiums kitchen wills watches on as charlotte 
               wearing an apron over her clothes prepares bisque under the 
               approving eye of the chef she quickly and expertly pours a 
               cup of cream and a cup of broth into a large blender then 
               she dumps in lobster meat and adds some saffron just when 
               she with a dramatic flourish is about to hit the start 
               button wills interrupts and puts the lid on the blender

                at the metropolitan museum of art wills and charlotte 
               wander amid the shadows of egyptian ruins

               wills waits for charlotte to come out of the ladies room

               he idly glances up as a stream of tourists moves past he is 
               about to look away when his eye catches someone

               it is lisa the young woman who spoke to charlotte at the

               employee photograph id she carries a takeout coffee

               wills follows her agitated and curious

               he sees her pass through a set of glass doors into the watson 
               research library

               he hurries over to the doors just in time to see her disappear 
               behind a bank of card catalogues

               wills notices a sign at the door that forbids entry to the 
               public he hesitates then enters

               librarian in her 60s he stops and asks a question about 
               lisa she nods

               wills is shaken by the answer he stares into the middle 
               distance wondering what to do his mind racing

               the librarian a little nervous now reminds him that he is 
               not allowed in the library he snaps to thanks her and 
               moves away

               but then he stops takes out a business card and returns to 
               the librarian he is about to hand it to her but then he 
               thinks better of it

               flustered he thanks her again and exits the librarian looks 
               after him confused and a little apprehensive

               for him when she spots him her face brightens she calls

               is flooded with moonlight the room is still dark but she 
               is far more clearly visible

               her dress is unbuttoned down the front she walks back to 
               him and stops about five feet away

               she releases the last buttons on her dress then slides it 
               off her shoulders to the floor she wears only her underwear 
               she crosses her arms over her breasts and smiles

               she closes her eyes takes a deep breath then slips off her 
               underwear she drops her arms to her side

               she stands before him entirely naked

               her selfconsciousness is excruciating but she is determined 
               to endure it finally she opens her eyes and smiles with a 
               hint of pride

               wills eyes widen as he takes her in he crosses to her and 
               lays his hands on her hips he kisses her neck

               as their breathing quickens she begins to unbutton his shirt 
               and pull it free of his pants

               he takes hold of her hands stopping her and starts to ease 
               her toward the bed she resists wills falters and she 
               realizes something

                                     charlotte
                         oh my god

               for the first time since weve met him wills is utterly at 
               a loss but he sees that charlotte has no intention of backing 
               down

               he begins to undress his hands are uncertain as he untucks 
               his shirt and unbuckles his belt when he is finished 
               undressing he turns to face her his arms at his side

               although we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows 
               charlotte can she looks down at his naked body and studies 
               it he stares back with shy wariness

               then she breaks into a crooked grin 

                                     charlotte
                         whats the matter old man cant

               laughing he grabs her wrists and throws her on the bed she 
               dissolves into paroxysms of laughter

               wills and charlotte make love as their passion builds 
               charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest

               she grabs his back her face twists she holds her breath 
               not wanting to reveal the incident to wills she closes her 
               eyes and exhales as the pain subsides

               int wills bedroom  later

               wills and charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the 
               city glimmering in the distance

               charlottes head rests on his chest eyes closed he brushes 
               his hand along her face as though he were a blind man 
               committing every detail to memory

               charlottes voice almost inaudible drifts up through the 
               dark 

                                     charlotte

               sipping a drink watching an eightyearold boy bob for 
               apples while other boys and girls cheer him on

               john wearing his king costume supervises as the boy wildly 
               sputtering struggles to bite into a renegade granny smith

                                     john

               sarah smiling curiously heads to the back stairwell

               she sees wills standing there watching the kids his eyes 
               are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she 
               noticed at the toy store 

               she gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as she 
               passes by and disappears upstairs

               finally the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his 
               soaked head to the cheers of his friends

               then he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites 
               out of it until he uncovers a silver dollar

               wills laughs at the kids excitement a moment later a womans 
               gloved hands cover his eyes

               she clears her throat and settles herself the twins listen 
               with rapt attention as she recites from memory slowly as

               charlotte looks up and sees sarah who face is beaming with 
               affection they share a smile and charlotte keeps reciting 

                                     charlotte
                         we passed the school where children 
                         played 
                         at wrestling in a ring 
                         we passed the fields of grazing grain 
                         we passed the setting sun

               sarah eases the door shut and steps away

               int brooklyn living room  hour later

               the camera makes a circuit of the thinning crowd sarah blows 
               out candles dumps ash trays and collects empties

               charlotte rubbing a knuckle into her sleepy eye descends 
               the stairs she sees celia talking to jesus and walks over 
               to them 

                                     celia

                                     sarah
                              from across the room
                         theyre down

                                     charlotte

                         kitchen going pretty heavily with 
                         holly golightly

                                     celia
                         hey no gossip! hollys a valued 
                         customer

               charlotte pretends to be fighting mad 

                                     charlotte
                         lemme at er!

                         hell hath no fury like a recluse 
                         scorned

               charlotte laughs and heads to the kitchen

               int brooklyn kitchen  same

               john wipes down the table which is littered with bits of 
               apple

                                     charlotte
                         hey shouldnt one of your minions 
                         be doing that

                                     charlotte

               they share a laugh

                                     charlotte
                         seen beelzebub around

                                     john
                         the prince of darkness

                                     charlotte
                         uhhuh

                         yeah he went upstairs

               charlotte is puzzled

               int brooklyn secondfloor hallway  later

               charlotte walks down the hall opening doors and glancing 
               inside she opens a bathroom and three cats dash out

                                     charlotte
                         shit

               she gets to the end of the hall and is about to give up 
               when she hears footsteps

               she walks around the corner and sees a narrow staircase 
               leading to the third floor

               at the dark at the top of the stairs wills and wendy appear 
               charlotte smiles 

                                     charlotte
                         you lost your horns

                         got quite a setup

               they arrive at the bottom of the stairs

                                     wills
                         wendy this is charlotte fielding 
                         charlotte  my friend wendy lister

               they smile and shake hands charlotte looks at them both 
               carefully for any sign of uneasiness there is none

                                     wendy

                         you guessed it

               wills smiles and rubs his hands together 

                                     wills
                         is the party over

               ext brooklyn bridge  night

               a town car speeds toward manhattan

               int town car  same

               wills and charlotte stare straight ahead each lost in 
               thought the lights of the city illuminate their faces in 
               eerie flashes

               finally wills glances over and smiles 

                                     wills
                         i have a strange feeling that youre 
                         upset with me

                                     charlotte
                         no i was just wondering if you had 
                         sex with that woman

                                     wills
                         ever

                                     charlotte
                         no the answer to thats pretty 
                         obvious i meant tonight on the 
                         roof

               wills breaks into a grin 

                                     wills
                         youre not serious

               wills laughs to himself then glances up and sees the 
               reflection of the drivers amused eyes in the rearview mirror 
               wills smiles back at charlotte 

                                     wills
                         of course not why would i want to 
                         do something like that

                                     charlotte
                         thats what i was wondering i 
                         thought were so happy hed have 
                         no reason to do it and if he did do 
                         it hed at least look guilty 
                         wouldnt he but he doesnt he looks 
                         more relaxed than before the party 
                         started

                                     wills
                         well there you have it

                                     charlotte
                         but then i thought hes a womanizer  
                         thats what they say funny word 
                         huh sounds like some sorta machine 
                         and how do you get to be a womanizer 
                         obviously by sleeping with lots of 
                         different women for no good reason 
                         and being really good at lying about 
                         it

                                     wills
                         sure except that 

                                     charlotte
                         let me finish

               again wills looks up at the drivers eyes in the mirror 
               they seem more serious now

                                     charlotte
                         anyway theres something about being 
                         sick right here 

               she touches her own chest her voice trembles slightly 

                                     charlotte
                          that has made me acutely aware of 
                         my heart nothing corny  i mean 
                         literally i feel every beat i 
                         know how sensitive it is it reacts 
                         to everything

               she turns in her seat and lifts an open palm

                                     charlotte
                         if youre lying to me ill know it
                              beat
                         did you have sex with wendy on the 
                         roof

               he smiles at her as though he were indulging a child she 
               looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt

               she slips her palm inside over his heart

               still smiling he doesnt move a muscle

               their eyes are locked

               ever so slowly her face crumples and tears appear in her 
               eyes she shakes her head 

                                     charlotte
                         my god oh my god

               she slides away from him drops her face into her hands and 
               begins to cry wills looks down then glances up at the 
               rearview mirror

               illuminated in flashes the drivers eyes have taken on an 
               ominous unblinking quality as though they were the outward 
               embodiment of his own conscience

               wills looks out the window when he finally speaks his voice 
               is calm and a little cold 

                                     wills
                         look i never pretended to be anything 
                         other than 

                                     charlotte
                              a piteous cry
                         you hate yourself so much!

               wills is stunned he looks out the window speechless his 
               eyes small and frightened

               ext charlottes brownstone  night

               the town car is stopped at the curb motor running lights 
               on

               int town car  same

               charlotte and wills sit in silence 

                                     wills
                         this was all a mistake right from 
                         the start all of it im a grown 
                         man and youre a child
                              beat
                         anyway you have better things to do 
                         with your last  with your time 
                         than spend it with me

                                     charlotte
                              distantly
                         what about you do you have anything 
                         better

               wills has no answer charlotte slowly gets out of the car 
               she leans back in her eyes narrow with disdain 

                                     charlotte
                         you know maybe youre right maybe 
                         this is the best time to end it 
                         because i was actually starting to 
                         love you wills and thats the last 
                         thing i ever wanted

               she shuts the door

               int brownstone foyer  night

               as charlotte enters we hear wills cab pull away she moves 
               to the stairs and sees a light shining beneath the living 
               room door

               int brownstone living room  same

               dolores sits watching an old movie her eyes dulled by a 
               cataract of boozy fatigue the door opens she looks up and 
               sees charlotte in costume

                                     dolly
                         well if it aint the belle of 
                         amherst

               charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked leather 
               ottoman she looks blankly at the tv she sniffles and wipes 
               a hand across her nose dolores glances over then back at 
               the set

                                     dolly
                         seen that face before

                                     charlotte
                         you have

                                     dolly
                         and for the same god damn reason

               charlotte is confused but then puts it together 

                                     charlotte
                         but you said wills and my mom were 
                         just friends

                                     dolly
                         sure but she was nuts about him 
                         the only reason she didnt sleep 
                         with him is cause she was 
                         sentimental and smart she wanted a 
                         ring first

                         to him he sure knew how to make a 
                         point

               she coughs again charlotte struggles to make sense of it

                         born till the day they die

               she realizes her poor choice of words she looks over and 
               their eyes collide charlotte begins to cry 

                                     charlotte

                         help! i wanted to learn!

               charlotte drops her head dejectedly

                                     charlotte
                         anything anything you would ever

                         that what the fuck do i know

               she rises gives charlotte a nervous awkward pat on the 
               shoulder then crosses over to the bar

               int wills living room  night

               wills stands in the center of the room looking around 
               blankly he disappears into the bedroom

               int wills bedroom  continuous

               wills enters and sees some of charlottes clothes folded 
               neatly on the bed a literary anthology lies open showing a 
               drawing of emily dickinson

               he grabs the clothes and the book and puts them in a shopping 
               bag that she has left on the floor

               then he walks into the bathroom we see him gathering beauty 
               products off the sink he walks back in and sets them into 
               the shopping bag

               he looks around and spots a nearly completed crossword puzzle 
               sitting folded on the dresser he drops that in the shopping 
               bag too then sets it by the door

               he feels a draft and spots an open window as he crosses to 
               it he notices something on his pillow a blank envelope he 
               picks it up and rips it open

               its a halloween card of a grinning jackolantern he opens 
               it and inside is handwritten

               the scariest night of the year and only one thing haunts me 
               that we might never have met

               all my love 
               xxx charlotte

               wills lowers the card and heaves a deep breath his jaw tight 
               he walks over and drops the card into the shopping bag

               int brownstone foyer  same

               charlotte emerges from the living room and shuts the door 
               behind her she climbs the stairs to her solitary bedroom

                                                             fade to black

               from amid the rush of traffic a taxi cab breaks free and

               an elderly couple passes them as they enter wills stops at 
               the coat check and helps patty with her coat she admires

                         benefit in leaving ones room is

               palpable sign of remorse it isnt forthcoming finally she 
               nods

                         more likely explanation is that the

                         i also thought it might be a good 
                         idea if we discussed ways to make 
                         her as comfortable as possible for

                         never sought to bore her with comfort

                         its quite all right but honestly 
                         it shocks me how often you people 
                         forget our phone books have as many 
                         numbers crossed out as written in 
                         so that while death is certainly as 
                         painful to us as it is to you we do 
                         not find it nearly so 
                         extraordinary

                         your mom was going back to smith i 
                         was moving down here to work on wall 
                         street it was our last day together 
                         she was crying she told me for the 
                         first time that she loved me i 
                         said i loved her too i promised to 
                         call and visit a few hours later i 
                         was in a cabana with millie
                              beat
                         when millie told me she was pregnant 
                         and that she wanted to marry me i 
                         escaped to la and i never saw 
                         her or your mom again

                         i think its part of the reason i 
                         never came back

                                     charlotte

                         it i mean you werent born that 
                         way

                                     wills

                         long as i can remember ive always 
                         run off at the first sign of a woman 
                         wanting anything from me relying 
                         on me in any way

               she considers for a moment 

                                     charlotte
                         but i want everything from you wills

                                     charlotte
                         so the only reason you dont dump me 
                         is because im sick because you 
                         know that its all going to be over 
                         anyway

                         it feels as though im not afraid 
                         anymore

               she looks at him and smiles he puts an arm around her and 
               draws her close

               int taxi  afternoon

               wills looks out the window his arm draped around charlotte 
               who lies nestled against him eyes closed

               he suddenly sees something he thinks checks his watch his 
               eyes ignite and he calls out excitedly to the driver 

                                     wills
                         driver! quick! pull over here! right 
                         here!

               charlotte a little sleepy comes to she looks out the window 
               and her face softens with happiness

               ext the brick church 92nd and park  same

               on the steps of the old church a choir sings christmas carols 
               all around them a large crowd sings along

               wills and charlotte get out of the cab his arm around her 
               wills pulls her into the crowd they join the carol wills 
               sings well charlotte is tone deaf

               in between lines of the song she calls out 

                                     charlotte
                         i didnt know you could sing!

               she laughs and continues to sing

               the carols ends to cheers and applause the choirmaster steps 
               forward to a microphone 

                                     choirmaster
                         well you all know what time it is!

                                     charlotte
                              confused to wills
                         no i dont do you

               he grins the choirmaster nods at someone in the distance 
               then holds up a hand fingers spread and begins to count 
               down the crowd joins in 

                                     choirmaster and crowd
                         ten nine eight seven six five 
                         four three two one!

               at that instant all the white christmas lights on the trees 
               of the median from 96th street to 44th street pop on 
               simultaneously  an enchanted fairytale spectacle

               the crowd and the choir cheer and clap cars honk their horns 
               charlottes eyes are filled with happy wonder

                                     choirmaster
                         happy holidays!

               as another carol begins wills wraps his arms around charlotte 
               and kisses her he pulls away looks deeply into her eyes 
               and whispers with passionate sincerity 

                                     wills
                         i love you charlotte

               for an instant her eyes flare as though she were surprised 
               then her eyes fill with tears she tries to speak but she is 
               choked by a sob

               she buries her face in his chest and cries wills smiles 
               with warm almost paternal indulgence he strokes her hair 
               she hugs him as though shell never let go

                         restaurant but the rents are too 
                         high

               he smiles at her and she smiles back

               int wills bedroom  morning

               charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest she opens 
               her eyes the room seems strange its the light

               she rises up and turns around her eyes narrow with curiosity 
               she crawls out of bed and runs to the window and looks out

               she cant believe her eyes central park is blanketed by 
               deep snow and more is falling she calls out gaily 

                                     charlotte

               she runs back laughing and jumps on the bed rousting him

               music up

               a sequence begins showing charlotte and wills during a day 
               of holiday shopping the deep snow has slowed the city to a 
               crawl but filled everyone with good spirits

               charlotte and wills move from store to store they buy 
               wreaths garlands ornaments candles and finally a 
               christmas tree and stand

               wills starts to lug the tree but when its obvious that 
               its too much for him charlotte spots a group of kids 
               spilling out of a record store

               the next thing we know the kids are lined up carrying the 
               tree over their heads like a battalion of ants

               wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator 
               and squeeze in theres no room for charlotte shell take 
               the lobby elevator

               music out

               int lobby elevator  afternoon

               charlotte carrying shopping bags ascends in silence with 
               michael she has no interest in chatting he as ever does

               door

               int wills foyer  continuous

               charlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing 
               and laughing each holds a fivedollar bill 

                                     michael

               charlotte wanders in the tree stands erect wills on all 
               fours tightens the screws on the stand he crawls to his 
               feet and studies it

                                     wills
                         straight

               then he sees her grave expression and freezes

                                     charlotte
                         i thought we had a deal

                         you were in ohio yesterday

               wills stares at her for a moment then explains without 
               apology 

                                     wills
                         i met with a heart specialist hes 
                         willing to operate

               for an instant she is surprised but then her indignation 
               takes over 

                                     charlotte
                         but you know i dont want that! you

                                     charlotte

                                     wills

                         out

                                     wills

                         such a god damn saint so above it

                         do want to live! and if you were as 
                         honest as you say you are youd let 
                         the doctors do whatever they can to 
                         help you!

               her face shuts like a trap she walks toward the bedroom 
               door 

                                     charlotte
                         i wont give people hope when there 
                         isnt any

                                     wills
                         why not! maybe we want hope! or 
                         maybe we just need to know that we 
                         did everything we could! maybe i 
                         need to know that if im going to 
                         be able to live to go on without 
                         without 

               suddenly a sob catches in his throat charlotte on her way 
               to the bedroom stops and slowly turns around

               she speaks matteroffactly without judgment or feeling

                                     charlotte
                         now i know why you hurt so many women 
                         because you always knew if you held 
                         on to one of them youd never let 
                         go

               she turns and exits coldly to the bedroom wills sinks into 
               an armchair

               int wills bedroom  later

               in grey afternoon shadows charlotte lies on her side fully 
               clothed under the covers with her eyes open thinking she 
               hears something and looks back

               wills stands in the lighted doorway

               she gestures for him to come he walks over and lies down 
               next to her she turns her back to him so that hes spooning 
               her but she takes hold of his hand pressing it against her 
               chest and squeezing it like a doll

               for a long time they lie in silence finally she murmurs 
               almost inaudibly 

                                     charlotte
                         when we met i was so lonely but i 
                         didnt even know it id been alone 
                         so long almost forever

                                     wills

                                     charlotte
                         but now we have each other
                              beginning to cry
                         oh what would i do wills what 
                         would i do if you werent here where 
                         would i be

               fighting his emotions determined to stay strong for her he 
               holds her close

                                     wills
                         you dont ever have to worry about 
                         that

                                     charlotte

                         tear up the papers! whatever you 
                         want! tell the doctor! because i 
                         really do want i dont want to 
                         leave you!

               the dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs wills closes his 
               eyes holds her even tighter and rocks her in his arms

                                                               dissolve to

               int wills bedroom  that evening

               charlotte still fully clothed lies sound asleep she slowly 
               awakens and sees that wills is gone she gets up on one elbow 

                                     charlotte
                         wills!

               she waits hears hurried steps then wills sticks his head 
               in 

                                     wills

               charlotte senses something odd in his tone her eyes narrow 
               with suspicion

               int coronary care unit preop  night

               charlotte lies semiconscious on a gurney wills appears 
               in the doorway with the nurse

               ext st vincents hospital heliport  night

               the helicopter lands and grandy jumps out

               music out

               int coronary care unit preop  night

               wills sits down next to charlottes bed he touches her hand 
               her eyes open then close again her breathing is heavy and 
               labored

               wills pushes a lock of hair off her brow then whispers 
               half to himself 

                                     wills
                         time cannot break the birds wing 
                         from the bird bird and wing together 
                         go down one feather no thing that 
                         ever flew not the lark not you 
                         can die as others do

               charlottes eyes open dreamily she shows a faint smile at 
               the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly 

                                     charlotte
                         what have i done to you

                                     wills
                         ruined me for other women

                                     charlotte
                         no i saved you for them

               her eyes close wills takes her hand and presses it to his 
               cheek

                                     male voice
                         is she type n cross for six units!

                                     nurses voice
                         yes doctor

               wills turns around and sees grandy standing in the doorway

                                     grandy
                         whatre we waiting for

                                     preop nurse

                                     grandy
                         then lets move!

               the nurse rushes over to the gurney and in an instant 
               charlotte is gone  wheeled with a bang through swinging 
               doors into the operating room corridor

               music up

               int coronary care unit waiting room  night

               everyone is there now  john sarah celia simon dolores 
               and shannon wills enters silently he walks to the new 
               arrivals and greets each one with an embrace

               int coronary care operating room  night

               charlotte lies on the table grandys eyes visible above 
               his mask are fiercely focused on his work

               int coronary care unit waiting room  night

               shannon lies with her head in sarahs lap

               dolores ignoring the sign smokes a cigarette

               john and celia sit sidebyside in silence

               wills stands at the window he looks over and see simon 
               standing close by simon looks at him his eyes sad but eerily 
               calm wills shakes his head 

                                     wills
                         it happened so quickly wed just 
                         talked about the surgery she agreed 
                         to it but i thought thered be time

                                     simon
                         ive had friends who werent expected 
                         to last till morning who lived another 
                         seven years another ran a marathon 
                         and died the next weekend its all 
                         so terribly random the way life 
                         actually works i take nothing for 
                         granted

               a light enters wills eye he smiles as he remembers 

                                     wills
                         you know its funny the first time 
                         i saw her i 

               but then wills hears something he turns and theres grandy 
               at the end of the long hall walking toward the waiting room

               simon looks and sees him too

               wills looks at simon with alarm its impossible how could 
               grandy be finished so soon wills looks back at grandy

               slowmotion

               grandy moves with long strides down the corridor

               one by one as they notice charlottes loved ones react to 
               the sight of grandy

               shannon rises from sarahs lap looks at the doctor then 
               covers her face with her fists holding her breath

               dolores crushes out her cigarette her expression falling

               celia touches johns back as he rises and walks over to wills

               simons face turns to stone

               john reaches for wills but wills advances a few steps toward 
               the corridor almost defiantly his eyes riveted to grandy

               grandys head is down

               then ever so slowly grandy lifts his head and in one 
               decisive move yanks off his surgical mask and throws it 
               against the wall

               close on wills face as he realizes

               his mouth opens wide as though to cry out but no sound comes

               int wills living room  dawn

               wills stands in the center of the room wearing his overcoat 
               he is pale exhausted his face expressionless

               john stands also wearing his coat in the hall archway 
               unsure whether he should stay or leave

               wills looks at the christmas tree whose lights still burn 
               he slowly walks over and pulls the cord from the wall

               the lights go out

                                                             fade to black

               fade in

               ext central park  spring afternoon

               a couple walks down the same walkway they are deep in subdued 
               conversation all around them spring is in full glory melted 
               snow trees exploding with green birds singing

               the man is wills keane but he has markedly changed his 
               dress is not so impeccable his hair has gone grey at the 
               temples his face though still beautiful has gracefully 
               turned the corner into middle age

               walking at his side is his daughter lisa now well along in 
               her pregnancy 

                                     lisa
                         actually to be honest peters more 
                         than a little freaked i mean how

                         less nothing really prepares you 
                         for it

                                     wills
                         i guess not

                                     lisa
                         he said its the first time since we 
                         got married that hes actually 
                         realized what marriage is that its 
                         forever that he cant just pick up 
                         and run away to nepal or something 
                         if we have a fight that hes part 
                         of the cycle of things now that 
                         hes gonna die some day that its 
                         the next generations turn to take 
                         the stage

               ext another central park walkway  later

               wills and lisa walk together in silence enjoying the perfect 
               afternoon then lisa smiles crookedly and slaps his shoulder 

                                     lisa
                         so what about you mr keane you 
                         ready to be a grandpa

               wills looks over at the spot where he first saw charlotte

               he smiles with wistful confidence then a little awkwardly 
               puts his arm around his daughter

               she is surprised at first but then slowly trustingly she 
               rests her head on his shoulder

               and they walk

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
