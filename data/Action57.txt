          splattering across the room across her
                         
          and then

          absence of any sound cat just sits in her chair
                         
          and then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into
          the room their assault weapons trained on the only living
          thing in the room

          her eyes

          close on cats hand
                         
          gripping the knife handle

          underneath the table her fist closed tight marco smiles
          kindly he holds out his hand

          unsuspecting open palm driven with such force the knife
          pierces through the back of his hand and sticks into the
          table beneath pinning his hand marco wants to scream
          but there is so much pain nothing escapes his throat

          races past them

          other cat hesitates for a moment takes the schoolbag
          from emilio then takes his hand and they walk off
          together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers
          and people pour out of the school and the surrounding
          stores as they put distance between the chaos and
          themselves

          as she moves through the maze of ducts on the way she
          peers through the grates in each ceiling down into one
          cell after another catching various views of inmates asleep
          as she passes over them until she comes to a ventilation

          garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
          chimes of all sizes and shapes made from scrap metal
          and two of the biggest most ferocious dogs on earth laying

          growl begins to rumble deep in their throats the gate to
          the garden begins to open and like a shot the dogs are
          up hurling themselves toward the opening gate eyes
          flashing barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
          life fangs bared ready to kill
