alien iii


the screen is black

a pinpoint of light appears
red  an ember 
unseen bellows blow

glass furnace

the embers glow  flame
the fire grows

a river of molten glass

heated by the furnace to over 1300 degrees fahrenheit 
white hot

glass factory

flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls  
coarsely grained wood  moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat  timbers split  patched with new wood
it too now old and dry

smoke

billows up the walls
hangs as an angry black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling  almost obscures 

a man

on a narrow ledge twenty feet about the glassworks floor 
his clothing is medieval  a rough textured cassock 
he is a monk

louvers are set into the wall  he angles them open
the smoke begins to escape

the monk turns raises arms and leaps from his lofty perch 
gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a flowing fox 
a primitive handheld pulley that runs down a rope
he lands next to the glass furnace surrounded by 

more monks

by their dress  with blowing iron and pontil
they blow and shape the molten glass  crack off the finished
pieces  the old way

one particular monk

black skinned early fifties
stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass but
he is watching something else  it moves him to song
lilting tenor lifts high into the air
this is brother kyle

			brother kyle
	well would he guess the ascending of the star
	wherein his patients fortunes settled were
	he knew the course of every malady
	were it of cold or heat or moist or dry
	brother john wouldbe doctour of physick

we see the object of his song

brother john

not yet forty  strong features but fear behind the eyes
the fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence
a good face nonetheless
he stirs a thick mixture in a mortar
next to him another monk sits holding his arm out in front of
him cassock sleeve rolled up revealing a vicious burn

		       brother kyle
		tend you quickly he will
		with bottles from a shelf
		but heals not so easily
		the ills which plague himself

brother john stops stirring

		      brother john
		   to kyle
		enough

he scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
burned monks arm  the burned monk inhales sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area  

		     brother john
		  to the burned monk
		relax
		  to kyle
		put those lungs of yours to better
		use

		     brother kyle
		yes doc tor

kyle laughs removes the blowing iron from the molten glass 
a blob of white hot glass hanging on the end

he rolls the blob on the marver a flat polished piece of 
iron then begins to blow a bottle shaped container 

john wraps a frayedged cloth bandage around the burn

			     john
		keep this from getting wet  go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and dont come
		back to work today 

		     burned monk
		but john 

			     john
		ill tell the abbot  just rest today
		youre lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace  if some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm 

he points to the top of his forearm

	   	            john
		 it wouldve burned clean through to
		the other side

he mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm
the burned monk shudders at the thought  

bells toll
 
		            john
		thats late afternoon  now get on

			burned monk
		thank you john  i 

			   john
		youre welcome  go!

the burned monk trundles off injured arm against his chest
john gathers his mortar pestle and extra bandages into a
burlap sack  kyle comes over

			  kyle
		good work

			  john
		all right but im no father anselm

  			  kyle
		youre yourself thats better

kyle pushes him through the door

into the hallway

the hallway is alive with cassocked monks
their low chanting reverberates throughout the building
the wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights
this is obviously a medieval monastery

			kyle
		the abbot will be pleased

			john
		dont

			kyle
		dont what

			john
		please dont tell him  at least until
		i know if theres an infection

			kyle
		you want to be the abbeys physician
		and you havent learned the first rule
		dont worry about the patient

johns face drops

			kyle
		i shouldnt have sorry  look i know
		how you must 

			john
		you dont but thanks anyway

at the end of the hallway

a wide stairwell  a constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs  coming from floors above  headed for lunch
kyle starts down  john starts up 

			kyle
		not coming down

			john
		i have someone waiting for me

kyle disappears into the crowd
john moves up

the stairway

a river of brown cassocks running downstream
john is the only one moving against the flow
he exits the stairwell 

one floor up

a narrow corridor lined with doorways
john moves to one in particular
he doesnt even look as he grabs the door knob
this is his room
he opens the door 

in brother johns room

an old worn out dog lays in wait on an old worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed
at the sight of john it stands

			john
		come on mattias

the dog mattias joins him in the hall
monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs 
past another dozen or so monks who are on their way down

int library

a vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floortoceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with books of all shapes and sizes  millions
of books from the looks of it
from each book hangs a long chain long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table

a corpulent monk  brother philip

in his fifties and the librarian by his stern affect his
position behind a broad but also old oak desk and the large
key hanging from his belt  he watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door
then rises and joins them

in the corridor just outside the library

john leans against the wall as philip exits
mattias is nowhere to be seen 

			philip
		brother john

			john
		brother philip

			philip
		feeding the mind instead of the body
		again

			john
		my training has taught me to feed whats
		hungry

philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway

			philip
		as did mine  as long as youre alone
		enjoy yourself  and remember no book
		leaves the library

			john
		how could i forget  have a good meal

john watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs
when hes gone from sight john lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal mattias

			john
		perfect

they move into the library

the medieval section

the oldest books
john moves to the stacks
mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits
this is his regular place

at the shelves

john stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient tome
he runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding
a smile plays across his lips

he carries the book places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain
sits on the bench next to the dog
clears his throat opens the book begins to read

			john
	    	    reading
		in the year of our lord 1348 i brother
		gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury
		the abbot and my sixty fellow monks 

			voice o/s
		sometimes i think youd like that

john turns to find 

the abbot

leader of the monastery  in his seventies but looks younger
his cassock is adorned with a large ornately carved wooden
chain in place of a rope belt  he crosses to the table

john closes the book and stands head bowed in respect

			john
		abbot i  i didnt think anyone would 

			abbot
		mind  just philip if he knew  i passed
		him on the way up  he said youd come 
		in alone  i knew better

he scratches the back of mattias neck

			abbot
		hello mattias  how are you boy

the dog snuffles in response

			abbot
		you know what philip says about mattias
		hair and his breathing  youll have to 
		take him out of here

			john
		he likes when i read to him and  i 
		cant 

john looks down sheepishly  though nearly forty he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the abbot  
the abbot pulls a large key from his pocket

			abbot
		    smiles
		someone must have left this one unlocked
		take the book with you

he hands the key to john who is shocked 
this is a great honor

			john
		father i 

			abbot
		kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today

			john
		ill reserve judgement until the patient
		lives

john crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book
he returns the key

			abbot
		it will get easier  father anselm was
		an unexpected loss  youll do fine

the abbot walks towards the door

			abbot
		just have it back before the end of lunch
		oh  and i didnt see you in here

			john
		thank you
		      to mattias
		lets go upstairs boy

john takes his book  moves to a spiral wooden staircase
mattias at his heels
goes up 

into the bell tower

the mechanics of the bell tower  all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows
a doorway leads to 

the roof of the abbey

thick with sandy dust  the wood shows through thin patches  
we pull back to reveal what we think is the roof of the abbey
is actually 

the surface of arceon  night

the door has opened onto the surface of a plantoid!
the curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below  
smoke curls from vents set into the surface
sunken areas of the planets sirface are seas

this is arceon
an manmade orbiter
a shell of lightweight foamed steel five miles in diameter
constructed by the company on special order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user

this orbiter for reasons to be discovered later has been
sheathed in wood

john

walks to the shore of an inland sea
sits on a bare patch of wood  looks up
his eyes grow accustomed to 

the night sky  john pov

freckled with tiny dots of light
stars  spread across the inky void
bathe arceons surface with their celestial glow

john smiles at mattias breathes deep 
the atmosphere up here is thinner but fresher 
he opens the book
reads aloud 

			john
		in the year of our lord 1348 i brother
		gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury
		the abbot and my sixty fellow monks day
		by day one by one until i am the only 
		one left  i stayed as long as i could bear 
		it then with my dog  

mattias lifts his ears at this part  his favorite part

			john
		 fled  i have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence  this black death  
		stay my hand
			beat
		this was finished by another hand

john closes the book  something catches his eye 
something among the myriad points of light in the sky
millions of miles away

one of the stars

brighter than the rest  moving
fast enough to leave a faint trail
across the stars  and down
a comet

john stands  watches 

the star

growing brighter
drawing nearer

john

joined by three other monks
they are older than he
the four men watch the sky

the star

brighter still  closer

more monks

two dozen  a hundred
they come up through the planets surface
out of wooden trap doors  join the others
days pass
now three hundred
necks bowed back
mouths agape
a subtitle identifies

			religious colony arceon
			
			population 350 exiles
			crime  political heresy

the star

fills the sky
burns brighter still as it hits the planetoids atmosphere

on the surface of arceon

hundreds of monks shield their eyes as the ship  the star 
roars over their heads  trailing fire 

john holds up his hands  to touch a star 
skin blisters as it passes over him
he turns and watches as it 
arcs downward 

into the sea

whomp ssssssssss !!
plumes of steam rise into the air
the water boils  fish bob to the surface  bloated  dead

john

is the first to hit the shore
small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake
his coracle is the first into the water
the others running up behind him
he cannot hear the shouts of warning

on the sea  dawn

the sun cracks over the black water
johns hands move the rough wooden oars
blistered palm opens
blood flows
he tears off a piece of his cassock 
rips it with his teeth 
wraps the bloody hand
rows

the star

ship  star ship
sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water
white metal skin blackened by the heat

john

rows right into it
his coracle pitches in the choppy surf  
he scrambles onto the ships cracked tile surface
teeters  balances  moves to the unmistakeable hatch
looks around for a knob a handle 

next to the hatch

a small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency  john hesitantly opens the door revealing a shiny
metal lever  he stares at ita beat
then quickly pulls it down
wuorrrsh !
hull door opens

the doorway is a black maw
john crosses himself
begins to lower his foot into the hatch 

			kyle o/s
		watch it!

he almost falls backwards off the ship  looks back 

the other monks

are rapidly approaching
kyle gestulates wildly 

			kyle
		john!  wait  !  dont go in!

john turns back to the open hatch
machine recirculated air flows out
he feels it on the skin of his face  cool
cool and artificial  it calls to him
he steps in  swallowed by the blackness 

whooshclang !
the door closes behind him

int sulaco escape pod #4  day

dark  dim red lights  john stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness  he sees

newts hyper sleep tube

a glass and metal coffin  pneumatic piping twines around its
base  the glass lid is broken  a small red light pulses at the
head of the tube  a soft voice and tone like your seat belt
warning  is audible

			computer voice
			sotto
		seal brokenseal broken

john finds himself moving towards the tube
looks through the broken lid

in the tube

there is a splattered blood stain on the sterile white
interior  old turned rustbrown
whatever happened here happened a while ago
rust colored drips trail down to 

the floor

drag marks  his eyes follow the stains to a pile of
bloody clothing against a control panel  a jumpsuit  torn
child size  the head of childs doll but no body to be found

john

looks back towards the door
part of him wants to get the hell out here  but he fights
back his fear  he is a doctor  or trying to be  someone
in here may need his help  he presses forward  
averts his gaze from the clothing up to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid  

lights

pressure lights  data lights  warning lights
thousands of lights  like the stars in the sky

its been decades since hes seen technology like this  and
never this close up  he steps further into the ship his fear
now replaced by fascination follows the lights

on a pale green screen

led numbers race  729101050607
a legand identifies elapsed since separation
he moves on

a video monitor

through scanning bars of snow an image
a woman with a young girl standing in front of her
the womans arms are wrapped around the girl
protective maternal

the woman speaks  her message repeats itself
a tape loop although john has no idea what that is

			woman
		taking pod four  the crew of the ss
		sulaco and all marine commandoes are dead
		ships sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle  an overlooked alien egg has
		hatched  bishop and hicks have been killed
		xenomorphs have infested the cruiser  newt 
		and i are taking pod four  the crew of

the warning tone of the womans message rekindles johns fear
he moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship
following the trail of blinking instruments 
drawn to touch a button  click

something tentaclelike drops down on his shoulder!
just an oxygen mask

john feels his rapidly beating heart as he pushes aside the
plastic dangling object and continues around the shuttle 
his hand brushes over a sensor which responds by lighting and 

hsssssssss !
a blast of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe 
john shouts and back up into 

another hyper sleep tube!!!

next to newts now empty tube
humming gently  still operational
john approaches it cautiously
he can make out the occupant through the lid

a woman

the woman from the screen  this is ripley
in hypersleep  wearing a white cotton tank top and boxertype
shorts  christ she looks beautiful  

john looks from ripley to her image on the monitor then back
sinks to his knees reverent  fascination has replaced fear
again  moves his face closer to the lid  
closer to hers

daylight spills in 
johns head whips towards the source of the light 

the door

open  kyle and the other monks

			kyle
		john  what is it  is this a supply ship

			john
		no  no supplies  kyle theres someone
		in here 

the second monk looks at kyle

			second monk
		this is forbidden

			kyle
		john  just get the hell out of there 

			john
		i dont want to stay  i have to get her
		out before this sinks  you come in give
		me a hand 

			kyle
		her  look this is not the supply ship
		so this is technology forbidden to us
		get out of there now!

john looks down at ripely
a keypad is mounted at the head of the tube
a red button  emergopen
thats plain enough

			john
		all right 

he presses it
the tube opens with a loud blast of compressed air
the monks at the door recoil at the sound

						cut to

ext space ship  on the sea  day

ripley has been lowered into a large coracle  john holds her in
front of him  unconscious  
her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves 
the monks start to row back to short

			first monk
		     reverent
		a space ship

			second monk
                    even more reverent
		a woman

			kyle
		you shouldnt have gone in 

			john
		im supposed to be a doctor

he pushes ripleys hair away from her forehead

			john
		she couldve been lost

			first monk

			second monk
		it isnt sinking  look at it  what are we
		supposed to do with it

			kyle

			third monk
		the abbot will know

			second monk
		theyre boiled  these fish are boiled 

			john
		thousands of lights  like the stars
		like heaven on earth

ripley stirs in johns arms  groans
fights to come out of her fugue state
looks around through halflidded eyes 
she is surrounded by rowing cassocked monks
monks  she closes her eyes
tries to clear the imagine  opens
theyre still there
she looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist 
realizes shes sitting on someones lap
looks back over her shoulder 

john

he smiles at her
friendly not sexual

ripley

shakes her head  tries to speak 
her lips form soundless words
she looks over her other shoulder sees 

the ship  ripley pov

bobbing on the surface  
growing small with each stroke of the oars

ripley

brows knit  fights the cobwebs in her brain
tries to focus on the ship 
remembers 
turns to john tries to speak 

			ripley
		wait  new

she loses consciousness  

						go to black

int the abbey  ripleys room  day

streaks of light move across the darkness
form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls
there is a sublime stillness but coming through the walls are
the muted far off sounds of the abbey 
the sawing of wood  hammering
whispered prayers
lilting song

we move down off the wall to a handmade wooden bed
ripley in restless sleep

ext arceon sea  dusk

the waters grown rough with the approach of night  wind whips across
white wave tops  sprays the dozen monks who lash their 
boats to ripleys ship with thick hemp ropes 
start to tow it to shore

int ripleys room  night

ripley is sleeping  but struggling against some unseen foe 
she tries to sit up  cant  tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animationlooks up through halflidded eyes

john

sits next to her  quite asleep
hands swathed in white bandages  book resting on his lap

she squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him  its skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light  seems to ripple as it moves 

the alien

big black shinysmooth head moves into the taper light
it moves towards her cablelike arms held out at its side 
moving out of sync with its feet  ripley tries to move  
to cry out  she cant

she can only move her eyes  she looks over at john sleeping
peacefully  he doesnt notice the alien 

the alien moves closer  
she can feel his breath  it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead  a chill runs through her but she still cant move 

the alien stands alongside her bed
extends a sixfingered hand
gently rests it on her stomach
cocks its head  like its listening to something
the implication is clear

ripley finds her voice 

			ripley
		aaaaaaaaaaaargh!

her eyes open wide 
she sits bolt upright

a hand moves to her forehead  gently pushes her head back to
the pillow  johns

			john
		youre out of it  out of it

ripley falls back eyes glued to where the alien appeared
john sees her focal point looks back over his shoulder
nothing
ripleys eyes roll back into her head
she tries to speak  it was there
her hand at her side tightens into a fist 

johns hand covers hers
eases the fingers open again
she feels the coarse bandages against her palm

he starts to read quietly from saint augustines confessions
she begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore

ext surgace of arceon  day

a howling dust storm has kicked up  the monks wear small round
goggles have rags tied over their noses as they work at a 
huge block and tackle arrangement 

hundreds of ropes grow taut
timbers groan
they lift ripleys ship  swing it over to a large portal 

int ripleys room  day

ripley lays with eyes closed
muffled voices outside her door

			abbot
		how is the woman john

			john
		i dont think shes here yet

at the sound of johns voice the slightest smile plays 
across ripleys sleeping lips

			john
		she is close though

as they continue talking ripley wakes  opens her eyes
rolls over onto her side 
there is a window right next to the bed
ripley lifts herself up on one elbow looks out

her pov

garden of earthly delights
monks laboring under a beautiful celestial blue sky 
picking apples fishing on the water on small inland lakes
working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages  lyrical
it makes her feel good  she scans the countryside

sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the  ripley does a take 

workers on a scaffolding

with crude brushes at the end of poles  paint the sky blue
the abbey the cottages the fields outside her window are all
on one level  inside the planet

the vaulted ceiling painted to look like the sky with huge
glass windows to allow the sunlight in is actually the
underside of the planetoids outer shell

ripley looks back at the monks on the ground
instead of repairing they are taking the cabins apart stacking
the wood onto push carts 

			ripley
		what the hell 

suddenly 
the sulaco escape ship appears in front of her
swings past her window suspended by ropes
then disappears up out of sight
ripley checks her pulse

			ripley
		this must be a dream  a bad one

she rolls back onto the bed
stares up at the ceiling

above her  on the roof of the abbey

monks scurry around the ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray
it seats with a deeply resounding thud

ripley

hears the sound and then another  her door opening
she turns to find the abbot and john standing in the doorway
john waits in the doorway as the abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits

			ripley
		who are you

			abbot
		i am the abbot  leader of this colony
		and you

he smiles  open  friendly

			ripley
		ripley  how did i get here

			abbot
		your vehicle crash landed
		     indicates john
		brother john found you and brought
		you here

			ripley
		where is here

			abbot
		this is the minorite abbey within the
		manmade orbiter arceon

			ripley
		can i use a radio to 
	
			abbot
		we have no radio here  we are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology  we live the old way  the pure
		way

she shakes her head

			ripley
		uh i  i still dont feel 100%  whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full df program
		wheres newt

the abbot looks at her blankly

			ripley
		there was a little girl with me 

			abbot
		you were alone

			ripley
		no  she was with me  i put her in her
		stasis tube  we launched when the 

			abbot
		you were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel

the abbot watches ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her 

			ripley
		     slowly
		oh god  newt

she stops  gets that chill up her spine 
she realizes that she must have brought the alien with her

			ripley	
		it came with us

the abbot leans in

			abbot
		what came with you

			ripley
		listen  there is a danger here  it
		came with me  how long have i been here

			abbot
		almost two days 

			ripley
		     calculates
		loose for two days  this planet could be
		overrun within the week

ripley grabs the abbot by his cassock 

			ripley
		look theres a xenomorph 
		    sees his confusion
		an alien creature  a killer  a monster
		and now its here

the abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of santa monica and 3rd whos babbling about judgement day  the
guy with his pants down around his kness

she sees this releases her hold on him
	
			ripley
		calm down ripley  okay i was with a
		platoon of colonial marines on a mission
		to planetoid lv426  we left earth six
		months ago  maybe a year 

			abbot
		     interrupts
		wait a moment 

the abbot becomes aware of johns presence in the doorway
turns over his shoulder at him

			abbot
		leave us

john waits there a beat then backs out and closes the door

			abbot
		continue

			ripley
		we launched in the cruiser sulaco from 
		gateway suborbital space station 

			abbot
		not possible

			ripley
		what do you mean

			abbot
		when we left earth seventy years ago it
		was on the brink of a new dark age
		technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planets environment  a computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge  there didnt seem to be any
		way it could be averted  in the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse
		finally the ships stopped coming  we 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass and the earth
		no longer existed

now she gives him that look
	
			ripley
		    slowly
		uhall right forget the earth  how
		many people do you have here  lets worry
		about them  warn them 

a new look overtakes the abbots face  a look of fear  
now shes getting to him  or is she
he abruptly stands 

			abbot
		your mind is troubled  you need to rest
		some more

			ripley
		i dont need rest  i need to get to 
		your people  youve got to get to them 
		tell them about the alien 

he heads for the door 

			abbot
		i have had enough for now

			ripley
		enough  didnt you hear what i said
		it could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet  it may have started 
		already  have there been any unusual 
		deaths since i got here

the abbot stops in the door 

			abbot
		no  and there wont be

the abbot slams the door behind him

the corridor outside ripleys room  day

john stands nearby as the abbot addresses two burly monks

			abbot
		bolt it

the guards move to bolt the door

			john
		what is it  whats wrong

			abbot
		your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state  nobody gets in or out until i
		say so

			john
		but i  her meals 

			abbot
		nobody

			john
		father i dont understand 

the abbot turns and disappears down the hall
john looks from the departing abbot to the two guard/monks


the library  night

john has his head buried in his hands  his back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep
mattias curled up on his feet  asleep as well
wham!
the library door flies open !
john sits bolt upright  

a hysterical monk bursts in
rushes to johns table

			hysterical monk
		brother john!  youre here!  the abbot

the dog just stares at him

			john

		all creatures great and small

int hysterical monks barn  night

a small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages  the wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off

the hysterical monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene  one of
his sheep is laying on its side

			hysterical monk
		i just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over

			john
		so would i  its freezing in here

			hysterical monk
		been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin

			john
		havent we all

john kneels at the ewe

shes breathing heavy  rapidly

john puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animals neck pulse with his right hand  
she gives a weak baaah

			john
		may be pneumonia  pitch some of that hay
		around her  stop this damn cold breeze

the hysterical monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall
starts to pile hay around the fallen animal

			john
		first ill 

he sits up to reach for his back then stops when he sees whats
on his left hand 

a slimy mucouslike substance

			john
		wait a minute

the hysterical monk stops on midpitch
john rubs the material between his fingers
brings it close to his nose  sniffs

			hysterical monk
		what is it

			john
		i dont know  its all over the ground
		some sort of 

baaaaaah!!!
the ewe starts to shake  quiver 
john tries to hold it down 
the hysterical monk at this juncture goes completely apeshit

			hysterical monk
		what!  what!

			john
		jesus!  help m 

the ewe is shaking so violently that john is thrown back 
he knocks over the bucket  the torch falls into the hay 
the light is cut off as the torch almost smothers
then the hay starts to burn 
weak fire light revealing

baaaaahasclortchh!!
the ewe explodes !

stomach bursts 
spraying the two monks with entrails and blood 
they start screaming

the flickering fire light grows as

a terrible alien chestburster

bursts out of the jerking and twitching carcass

it shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated  tiny razor sharp teeth and black glasslike eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy but gorematted
wool  a quadroped its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines

john can only scream as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animals mortal coil

the hysterical monk fear overcome with anger at the loss of
his beloved sandy  steps in front of the near catatonic medic
and instinctively thrusts his pitchfork into the creature 
the sharp prongs pierce its still forming body 

the creature

wails a high pitched shriek  half alien half sheep as it is
roughly torn from its nesting place 
the monk lifts 

it twists at the end of the fork acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor  each drop bursting into a little pool of fire

the hysterical monk turns to the now raging hay fire 
the entire corner of the barn is ablaze 
shoves the abomination in 

the sheep/alien pops and sizzles as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at its struggling body  tiny tail whipping about 

the creature dies its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn  the hysterical monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on 

john

face contorted eyes glued to the burning creature  heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram but no sound comes from
his open mouth  the doctor in training has seen the devil

ext hysterical monks barn  night

wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre
acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters

we pull back from the sight into a window into

int ripleys room  night

ripley watches the burning barn  frustrated she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs wearing her tank top and shorts
pulls on a coarse wollen cassock ties the rope belt 

			ripley
		idiotsill 

wham!
the door bursts open 

			ripley
		what the 

four burly monks rush in and grab her
tear her out of bed 

int hallway  night

ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway

			abbot vo
		an evil has come to arceon

in the tribunal room  night

as he continues we move down a row of stern monk faces ending
at the abbots

			abbot
		you heard brother graham tell of the
		devil inside sheeps wool 

he motions towards the hysterical monk sitting in the crowd

			abbot
		an evil brought by this woman in her
		vessel of technology

pull back to reveal

a large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high  light creeps in through stained glass windows

hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the tribunal  on the floor

the abbot and the five eldest monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand  on the stand

ripley

considers the faces that surround her  fear  hate

			ripley
		this cant be happening

			bald tribunal monk
		you have no voice in this tribunal

			ripley
		you must listen to me!  youre all in
		terrible danger!  it came with me on
		the ship 

			abbot
		we know that  at first we believed its
		arrival was a good omen  but it has only
		brought pestilence  dead sheep  dead fish

			bald tribunal monk
		evil

ripley turns to the abbot

			ripley
		yes the ship brought it  not evil it
		brought the alien  i told you its here

			abbot
		we know the name of the evil it brought
		it brought technology  technology to
		destroy our planet as surely as it
		destroyed the earth

			monk in audience
		destruction!

			ripley
		i was on the earth less than a year ago
		its still there  people cities all 
		still there!

a murmur through the crowd  some are listening to her
the abbot looks around  he must be in command

			abbot
		    matter of fact
		all dead

			ripley
		    screams
		its still there!

the abbot smiles to himself for making her crack
he stands and begins to pace

			abbot
		you could not have been on the earth a
		year ago because there is no earth to
		be on  for at least twenty years

			ripley
		i havent been floating in space for
		twenty years  let me get to my ship
		and ill prove it

			bald tribunal monk
		no  who knows what new evils shell
		release if allowed back into that
		infernal machine

			monk in audience
		no!  dont let her!!

			tribunal member
		this woman is a danger  she denies the
		new dark age  she denies reality

			ripley
		this is reality  there is a xenomorph
		loose on this planetoid  a alien  it must
		have stowed away on my ship  must have
		killed 
			swallows hard
		newt  killed the girl i brought with me
		you cant stop it  it goes inside you like
		an egg  grows 
			mimes
		explodes out of you  keeps growing into
		some sort of monster  kills you 
		kills all of you

she looks at the medieval people around her
they stare at her in complete confusion
to them she does sound like a madwoman

			ripley
		who are you people  look at you  all
		of you  the way youre dressed  this
		isnt the middle ages  youre in space 
		on a artifical planet  what are you
		doing out here

there in the upper tier  john  they make eye contact 
she looks to him pleadingly

			ripley
		isnt there anyone here who will
		listen

john looks from ripley to the abbot
the abbot stares him down
john turns away

			ripley
		    defeated
		i guess not  i cant believe this

the gavel bangs
the abbot sits in a moment of contemplation

			abbot
		then there is no choice

the four monks grab ripley roughly 
bind her arms

			abbot
		   to ripley
		the evil is inside you  i cast you down
		to be sealed away  and god have mercy on
		your soul

						slam cut to

the shaft room  day

a medieval elevator shaft  the elevator is a wooden cage
lowered on thick rough hewn ropes
ripley bound is led to it

she looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door 

			ripley
		you wont be able to fight it
		you dont know what it is !

shes put into the cage  the door is secured
two monks begins to pull the ropes  the cage is lifted out over
the abyss  a vast cavernesque space

the other monks move closer  crowd around the edge 
john pushes through them  right to the edge 
watches as the cage is slowly lowered down

ripley looks directly at john 

			ripley
		youve sentenced yourselves to 
		death!

john watches as she disappears down into the darkness
then turns and pushes his way through the crowd 
down the hall 

the tribunal room

empty now except for the abbot and the tribunal members
they speak in hushed tones
john appears in the doorway but pauses 
strains to hear what they are saying

			bald tribunal monk
		theyll have started before she gets
		down to the hermitage level

			abbot
		no trouble

			bald tribunal monk
		only finding the wood for the ship  but
		andersons hut was about that big and
		hes dead three months now

			abbot
		i had that wood earmaked for the cloister 
		next winter  well we might not get to
		the winter if we dont take care of this
		by winter time we can start taking the 
		penitent cells apart  no one in them

			another tribunal monk
		the wood isnt going to last forever

			abbot
		neither are we 

he becomes aware of johns presence and motions the other
tribunal members out of the room  john moves to the abbot
the abbot knows whats coming

			abbot
		go ahead

			john
		this woman  ripley  i tended her 

			abbot
		yes and you did a good job  you
		shouldnt feel responsible  you
		couldnt have known 

			john
		please sir let me finish  i feel that
		there may be something to what she says

			abbot
		there isnt

the abbot moves to his table begins to gather up his gavel
notebook  john follows him 

			john
		i dont understand what you are doing

			abbot
		this colony is my responsibility  i am
		protecting the colony

			john
		from what  this woman  you never gave
		her a chance  how can you be so sure
		youre right

			abbot
		a better question is what makes you
		think im wrong

			john
		you didnt see this thing  this demon 
		brother graham and i  we both saw it

			abbot
		      realizes
		thats right  you both did
		      beat
		and what was it

			john
		i  i dont know what it was  but i
		dont think ripley was a party to it

			abbot
		she admits she brought it

			john
		but she tried to warn us 

			abbot
		you know thats how the devil works
		deception

			john
		but i believe her  i dont know how to
		describe it  a feeling

			abbot
		you havent seen a woman in thirty years
		where does this feeling originate john

			john
		     points to his head
		here

pause

			abbot
		i believe you  but your feelings are
		fooling you  

			john
		its  its her conviction  i just think 

the abbot snaps at him 

			abbot
		dont think

john takes a step back at the abbots tone  a tone hes never
heard before  the abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair
forces a smile

			abbot
		its been a long night  for all of us
		you really dont understand what youre
		dealing with here

			john
		thats what she said

the abbot chafes

			abbot
		these are ideas which threaten the very
		system we live under  the creature is
		dead and the woman is gone  forget them
		both  go read  go fishing  go anywhere
		but leave this alone

			john
		but i 

			abbot
		alone  ill get philip to let mattias
		into the library all right  for your
		own good just stay out of this

john looks like hes going to protest

			abbot
		i mean it

			john
		     slowly
		yes father

john turns and leaves the room  
the abbot stares after him


int prison level  night

dark dank dreary
a nail is hammered into a board  then another
the board is old twisted  the grain is pronounced splintered

another board is lifted into place a nail held  bambambam 
hammered in tight


two ancient workers

drab torn gray clothing
hammer the boards over the opening in the wall
methodically covering up 

ripley

watching them work
bambambam
defeated


on the roof of the abbey intercut

a dozen monks frantically hammer planks up around the sulacco
escape ship  a frame of wood 
begin to wall it in


in the prison level

the two ancient workers continue their carpentry
the planks cover more of the opening
bambambam

covers more of ripley
bambambam
she stares


on the roof of the abbey

planks are rising around the ship
covering it  locking away the good omen turned evil

in the library

john and mattias sit before an open book
he doesnt read  he can hear the pounding of the hammers
it seems to reverberate through the planet
through his skull
he closes his eyes in pain

ripley

only her face is visible
another board
bambambam
then just her eyes

just before the last plank is put in place 

			worker
		here you go woman  something from your
		ship  something to keep you company 

he tosses it into the cell  ripley catches it
watches as the last of the light is covered over
bambambam

she continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness  the little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught 

newts dolls head

ripley looks around her cell  actually a narrow space behind
other cells one wall curved out  like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie 
looks at the dolls head in her hand
a beat

she freaks out !

			ripley
		you fucking idiots!  youre dead!
		youre all dead!

beats the walls  kicks
smashes her head against the wall
again
her nose starts to bleed
her hand goes to her nose
she squints in the darkenss
sees the blood
tastes the iron taste in her mouth
death is with her again

			ripley
		     sotto
		dead

the widest part of her cell the middle allows her to slide
down into a sitting position  she does

			ripley
		christ  jesus christ  its here  here
		shit  here  i cant get rid of it

looks at the dolls head 

			ripley
		newt  this isnt what i wanted

she throws the dolls head away 
it bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her

			ripley
		     snaps
		dont stare at me!

beat

			voice o/s
		sorry

ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her 
where it meets the floor in the rotting timbers
a hole  in it

a mans face

bright wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut
hes looking back at her


on the roof of the monastery  night

the sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the monks have
finished walling it up  now just another part of the abbey

as the monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow 
pass them  down to an open window and into


int library  the medieval section  night into dawn

john is here mattias asleep at his feet
the tables the benches the floor are covered with hundreds of
books hes pulled off the shelves their chains all tangled
all open to 

pictures of devils

different representations of evil through the ages 
lucifer shaitan ahriman asmodeus  satan
the temptation of christ from the master of schloss
lichtenstein  satan roasting on an enormous grill from
tres riches heures du duc de berry

the devil as a serpent  as a semihumanoid
gruenwalds temptation of st anthony
pachers saint wolfgang and the devil
a miasma of medieval monsters


john

picks his way through the mess  like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book

the first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows  john rapidly flips through the medieval
tome in front of him  past an illustration of satan depicted
as having a face on his ass  further still  then stops
this is it

we cant see what the illustration is but we see his reaction

his eyes open wide as saucers  slams the book closed as if the
image would strike blind  he turns to mattias as if to say
something  decides not to wake the sleeping dog

john wraps the books chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf  pulls  spankt!
the old chain gives way

face set he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder  clutches the book to his chest gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes


int hallway outside abbots office  day

john strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the abbots 
office opens suddenly 

brother graham the hysterical monk is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly monks taken down the corridor in the other
direction  he is gagged  a third burly monk moves out of the
doorway with the abbot

			john
		now find john and have him brought to 
		me immediately

			third burly monk
		yes father

			abbot
		start in the library  and keep it quiet 

the third burly monk nods and moves off
the abbot watches him leave then goes back into the room and
closes the door  john stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind  he turns and runs back down the hallway


int glass factory  day

the first monks straggle in for the morning shift
kyle is among them  he lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other monks begin to stoke the fire

john enters
looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find 


kyle

at the glass furnace  about to dip his blowing iron into the 
molten glass  john runs over to him
almost knocks him over 

			kyle
		hey!  watch it!

he sees that john is agitated 

			kyle
		what  what is it

the other monks begin to notice the commotion start moving in
for a look

			john
		i  abbot  must 

john tries to catch his breath  he gestulates wildly
kyle puts down his blowing iron

			kyle
		john  relax  take a deep breath 
		christ now i sound like you 

he sees the book clutched in johns white knuckled hands

			kyle
		is that it john  is it the book 

			john
		     panting
		yes  devil

kyle moves closer to him  cautiously
john sees the other monks gathering around 
closing in on him  whispering 

			whispering monks
		hes got it

			second whispering monk
		like the comet woman

			third whispering monk
		he found her
		
			whispering monk
		hes infected

john sees one of the monks run out  undoubtedly going to tell
the abbot  john looks into his friend kyles face  fear

			kyle
		everythings gonna be fine  now lets
		see the 

			john
		dont humor me  im 
	
			kyle
		sure  everythings gonna be fine

if only he could explain  he cant
john yanks the book away  spins 
bursts through the crowd

			kyle
		wait  john!


int shaft room  day

the cage is still down the ropes stretching into the abyss
john runs in  moves to the ropes  places the book on the floor
tightens his scarred hands on the rope  mind racing  
the woman will know  know what it is  how to combat it
he pulls 

theres no tension against the ropes
john falls back on his ass

the ropes whiz through the rusty pulley overhead
pile on the floor in front of john 
he lifts the end of the rope  stares
bitten through

							cut to

through the monastery  series of shots

john runs through the building
through the upper half of the planet
down through the many levels past dozens of monks oblivious to
the previous nights events and the danger they face

monks working at looms
monks in the tanning room
monks in morning prayer
past them all to 


int abbey basement workroom  day

mops and brooms
john enters  his hair is wild breathing heavy
he shoves the book into his medical bag
pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
wooden door set into the timbers of the floor
he opens the door


ladders

extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level
past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters
beyond that  a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet  below that the cells
and ripley


john

can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels
he must go down  the hard way
he climbs into the darkness


int abbey lavatory  night

an enormous room over a football field in length consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet stalls facing a hundred wall
mounted sinks  their condition though bespeaks the awful
truth 
the stalls furthest away from us are cobwebbed
some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood
of the original hundred sinks maybe twenty are still
functional  a facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left

a skinny monk washes his hands


in the stalls

moving down the row of stalls chest high thank you past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces the second to
last being the abbot 

			abbot
		cold tonight 

 continuing to the last bald tribunal member

			bald tribunal member
		gets colder every night

			abbot
		and every day  never this bad  taken
		so much wood out of the structure the
		surface wind blows right through the
		colony  right under the floor 

the bald tribunal member shivers as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl 

			bald tribunal member
		right up your bloody backside  nights
		like this make me miss plumbing  
		ack !

he feels a tugging at his bowels  its not piles 
a beat

			abbot o/s
		what

			bald tribunal monk
		i dont  aah 

the bald tribunal monk screams as something grabs him from
below 

note the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off
i have completed the text to the best of my ability

something snakes up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
he convulses in spasms of agony

there is a terrible ripping sound as the bald tribunal monk is 
pulled violently down  out of frame 

we pan back down the row of stalls tight on each sitting monk
and see their horrified reaction as they feel the alien drag the
bald tribunal monks body away under them

the abbot in his stall

he pounds on the wall 

			abbot
		matthew  matthew  jesus whats wrong

skinny monk washing his hands sees all this  looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet 


other monks

in their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
blood and viscera spraying the walls  converting the abbey
into an abattoir

		death


int ripleys cell  night

darkness  somewhere water drips into a puddle
ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor  her eyes are closed

			ripley
		wherever i go

a hand pushes a crust of bread through the hole 
she opens her eyes to look at the food  the whitehaired mans
head appears 

			whitehaired man
		take it

			ripley
		thanks but no thanks anthony

she knows his name

			anthony
		you waiting for meat  they dont bring
		me meat because they know im an android
		really dont need it  breads better
		for you anyway  harder to digest so 
		it makes you feel fuller than you are

			ripley

anthony takes a bite

			anthony
		mmmm  just a little crunchy

ripley twists onto her back until shes staring up at the
ceiling

			ripley
		waste of time

			anthony
		you dont eat youll starve to death
		girl

			ripley
		that was the plan when they put me down
		here  and why should you care

			anthony
		because im a synthetic person you dont
		think i can care

			ripley
		believe me thats a discussion you dont
		want to have with me

			anthony
		you told me you had a bad experience and
		a good one with androids 

			ripley
		thats one of each  that means you could
		go either way  im tired of talking about
		this

he pushes the bread towards her again

			anthony
		youve still gotta eat  you gotta fight
		the bastards 

			ripley
		im tired of fighting  maybe ill be
		dead before he finds me  maybe he wont
		get the satisfaction

			anthony
		he  you make it sound like this alien
		has a personal score to settle with you
		the biology you describe  queen laying
		eggs larvae drone  thats very
		insectoid  insects usually dont bear
		grudges

			ripley
		and androids usually arent the prisoners
		of lunatics that believe theyre ancient 
		greeks

			anthony
		medieval monks

			ripley
		whatever	

			anthony
		and theyve only chose to live the life
		style they dont believe theyre 
		     hears something
		whats that

ripley strains to listen  in the distance
knocking  someone is knocking on the walls
a voice calls out 


int prison level corridor  night

			john
		     hoarse
		ripley!

he moves down the hallway
bangs his fist against the walls every few feet 
waits a moment for a reply then moves on


int anthonys cell

anthony gets off the floor  moves so she can see into his cell

the walls of anthonys cell are covered with charcoal sketches 
different versions of demons and the devil  she rolls her eyes 
this guy is an android!

anthony crosses to his cell door peers through eye level


int prison level corridor hallway  anthony pov

john coming towards him knocking on the doors of boarded up cells

			anthony
		hey  you knocking  cut it out 
		youre going to wake everybody up

john moves to anthonys door  looks at him through the slot
anthony recognizes him

			anthony
		brother john

john unbolts anthonys door
picks him up by his cassock 

			john
		anthony  thought you dead fifteen years

			anthony
		made too good for that  whatre
		you doing

			john
		i  im looking  the abbot 

			anthony
		what  you look like youve seen the
		devil

			ripley o/s
		he has

anthony turns to look back at ripley  moves aside so john can 
see her face at the hole 

			anthony 
		you mean he 

anthony turns back  john is gone

int the corridor

as john begins to pull the outermosk planks off

			ripley
		i was right wasnt i  youve seen it
		youve seen the alien

john pauses at that  
his eyes tighten at the memory

			ripley
		i can tell you have  i was right
		it came with me
			to the wall sharp
		go away

john stops  looks at the wall
ripleys voice comes clearly through the wood

			ripley
		listen priest or whatever you are i
		know what you want  i cant help you
		i couldnt help any of the others  
		just stop what youre doing  go away
		do you understand

john has opened a crack that exposes ripleys eyes  
he stares at her a beat tries to think of what to reply 
he goes back to work as she continues her confession

			ripley
		you going to stay father  but youre 
		not going to talk  okay  then you can
		listen  you should listen  your abbot
		was right  i am guilty  but not of 
		heresy  of murder

john stops again
just stares at her eyes

			ripley
		the murder of the crew of the nostromo
		that was when i first met the alien

that reminds him of why hes here
he doubles his efforts at the boards

			ripley
		no not the same one thats here now
		or maybe it is  maybe theyre all the 
		same one  i couldnt save my crew then
		i should have been able to  but i couldnt
		when i went the second time 

her eyes soften

			ripley
		then i met newt  newt  i fought 
		stayed alive to keep newt alive
		hoped maybe that would make up for

she trails off  slides down the wall

			ripley
		now he got her too  whats the point
		     hard again
		just go away  leave me in here  if you
		let me out youll want me to help you
		and it will start all over again
		let it end

john breaks through flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him  ripley looks up at him

			ripley
		i cant help you

john heaving and panting from the excertion
swallows

			john
		puh pant please

			ripley
		it never ends


int corridor  prison level  night

a long twistedplankfloored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet  there is movement at the far end  something is
coming towards us  flickering in and out of the light and 
shadow 

			ripley o/s
		sheep

ripley john and anthony

running together  anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear  john has his bag  ripley a torch 
we move with them

			anthony
		it must be able to take on some of the
		characteristics of the animal it grows in
		maybe they are from some sort of aggressive
		soldier race  warring parties drop the
		eggs on opposing planets 

			ripley
		and the alien takes on the form of the
		creature that finds it assuming that
		animal is the dominant life form on the
		planet  so when it gestates in a man 

ripley shudders at the memory

			anthony
		its a biped  in a sheep or cow a quadroped

			ripley
		shit  i just didnt think it could do that
		to animals

			john
		wait a minute  i thought you were the
		expert on this monster

			ripley
		is that the only reason you came to get
		me out  because i knew about this thing

			john
		yes  i mean no  i mean that was part of
		it  look  i never thought you were wrong
		i was wrong not to say anything  i was
		afraid to speak up  its hard to be a 
		monk you know

ripley stops  looks at him
a long beat

			ripley
		thank you  if anything youre honest

			john
		we all are  took vows

			ripley
		i dont know about the abbot

			john
		im sure he thinks what he did was right

			ripley
		is that speaking up for someone

			john
		no  charity

she smiles  they turn a corner


int sloping corridor  night

this hallway slopes downwards a few degrees  the three find 
themselves trotting leaning backward to keep their balance

			ripley
		all right lets forget about the past
		and get on to our survival  no more
		prisoners behind us

			anthony
		not for years

			ripley
		okay  if the aliens had a few days
		to lay his eggs our only hope is to get
		off this  what is this

			john
		arceon

			anthony
		satellite

			ripley
		get to my ship and get off this satellite

			john
		we cant

			ripley
		we cant what

			john
		leave arceon  cant leave the library 

			ripley
		a tape library

			john
		books

			ripley
		so

			john
		the reason we are out here  like the
		monks who guarded monastery libraries 
		on remote islands off england during
		the first plague 

			ripley
		there must be books on other colonies 

			john
		some of these books survived the burning
		of the libraries of alexandria  they
		contain knowledge that exists in no 
		other record  their value is unestimable

he runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag

			john
		were supposed to protect them

			ripley
		    to anthony
		and what does an android have to do 
		with all this

			john
		hes a spy

			anthony
		the company planted me here

			ripley
		the company  what does the company have
		to do with this

			anthony
		they built this prison

			ripley
		prison

			john
		colony

			anthony
		prison  they are all political heretics  

ripley looks at john

			ripley
		you left that part out

			john
		the order was more of a counter culture
		a reaction to the technology that was
		beginning to take over everyones lives
		it was a simple enough idea  read dont 
		watch disk  walk dont pump more carbons
		into the air  the earliest members
		renounced technology  started to collect
		the remaining books  nobody would have
		noticed if it hadnt been for the virus

			ripley
		your abbot talked about that  the
		new plague

			anthony
		a computer virus  a bad program  by
		this time the corporate structure was
		transglobal all the worlds data storage
		systems were linked  it spread through
		two countries before it was stopped

			john
		after a scare like that thousands flocked
		to our retreat  people started clamoring
		for written information  for our books
		they abandoned the modern ways 

			ripley
		i think i can see how this comes out	
		they gave up their possessions

			anthony
		this was a threat 

			ripley
		to the company

			john
		they sold the technology  a movement 
		to live simply was quickly twisted by 
		federal agents into a political movement
		against the companycontrolled world
		government  too much was at stake

			ripley
		too much profit

			john
		we were sentenced as political dissidents
		this orbiter is our gulag  all the men
		were packed up with all our books and
		towed into space  ten thousand men  the
		eldest died very quickly

			ripley
		the company had such a sense of irony  
		sending you out on this wooden tub

			anthony
		i was placed among them as a sensor
		keeps tabs on the movement

			ripley
		so howd they find out about you

			anthony
		i told them  after the supply ships
		stopped coming i saw no point in keeping
		up the charade  since i was a sort of
		walking reminder of technology they cast
		me down

			ripley
		join the club
		     to john
		i figured this wasnt planned  you dont
		have to be a genius to see it wouldnt be
		prudent to try to preserve mans written
		works for generations  without women

john looks embarrassed

			ripley
		and i dont know about your new plague
		but i was just on earth and everythings 
		fine

john has a doubtful look

			ripley
		i was right about the alien wasnt i
		means i must be right about the earth

the logic behind her argument is uncomfortable

			john
		     beat
		perhaps

			ripley
		thats better than nothing  come on

they reach the end of the corridor
it opens into 


int transom space  prison level

an enormous open space between cell blocks
the wall behind them is honeycombed with corridor openings
going up four stories connected by aged warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of indian cave dwellings  only wooden

the room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
 falling off into gloom

they stand silent for a moment dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them  finally 


			ripley
		at any rate lets forget about the
		earth completely  whether youre right
		or im right whats important is getting
		the hell out of here  from here my ship
		is

john points up at the ceiling

			anthony
		in heaven

			ripley
		right  and this is

anthony and john nod

			anthony
		this orbiter was patterned after a 
		medieval concept of the universe 
			 makes a circle in the air
		they call the top half heaven  

			john
		the abbey the fields 

			anthony
		the bottom half is hell  where we are

			ripley
		aptly named  whats in the middle

			john
		the sea

			anthony
		really

			ripley
		work with me here  how far is it back
		to the surface of the planet

			john
		as a stone falls  five miles through
		the center

			ripley
		and the elevator  the thing they
		lowered me down in

			john	
		ropes cut

			anthony
		its smart  first he cuts their escape
		off then works his way down through the 
		monastery level by level until there
		isnt a thing left alive  interesting

			ripley
		well you start appreciating him more
		than me and ill find a way to shut
		you down capisce andy  how do we
		get up

			john
		there are ladders

she stops  john and anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her

			ripley
		five miles with the alien between us
		and there  good luck boys

she turns and heads back towards her cell 
john catches her shoulder 

			john
		you cant 

			ripley
		cant what  not help you go to your
		deaths  ive had my fill of that

			john
		i need you  i cant do it alone

			ripley
		ive fought these creatures twice
		before  it take a lot to kill
		these things  heavy artillery

			anthony
		we dont have weapons here

			ripley
		how about something we can make weapons
		from  do you have anything like that 
		any modern things here

john shakes his head vehemently 

			john
		we renounced technology  it was those
		things that caused the plague

			ripley
		this is a manmade planet  something has
		to be recirculating your air your water

			john
		god

			ripley
		please

			john
		i dont know  i just took it for granted

			ripley
		most people do  without some sort of
		technology we havent got a chance

from behind them

			anthony
		there is technology

john and ripley turn to look at him

			anthony
		a room  a technology room  fresh air
		and water come out

			ripley
		an atmosphere processing plant 

			anthony
		the heart and lungs of arceon

			ripley
		where is it

			anthony
		one level beneath the underground sea

			john
		thats five levels up 

			anthony
		     points into the gloom
		on the other side of the orbiter

john looks at ripley 

			john
		a chance

ripley looks from johns earnest face to the darkness and back

			ripley
		all right  youve got me  so far
		but heres the deal  i dont know
		how many of your brethren are going
		to be alive when we get up there
		but if we make it to my ship youre
		all coming with me  well take as
		many of your precious books as we
		can carry but were going  im not
		going to fight this thing again to 
		end up alone again  understand

john nods his head

			ripley
		were all dead anyway  we might as
		well go fi 

she feels a twinge in her midsection 
doubles over  anthony and john each take an arm 

			ripley
		ugh  im all right

she takes a deep breath

			ripley
		still thawing out  i hate hyper sleep
		come on

							cut to


int arceon  monastery level  night

the formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield  wooden huts leveled  small fires dot the land
the air thick with ash and greasy smoke

dozens of monks swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar  in one hand a taper or torch held high
in the other hand their weapon scythe pitchfork hoe
whatever they could get ahold of seem pitifully out of place
some pound sharpened stakes into the ground others push carts
into rough barricades

a platoon of monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden ground  more ladders
they climb down to 


an underground wheat field  night

just beneath the monastery level of the satellite an 
underground wheatfield  tall golden grass stretches out for
miles swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the abbey fifty feet above 

the ceiling

a latticework of suspended troughs and wooden pipes 
the plumbing the understructure of the monastery


the monks

descend the ladders single file  fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories  they move cautiously
into the wheat  spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line


the abbot

the bald tribunal monks dried blood splattered on his cassock
stands atop an empty wooden wagon  from this vantage point he
watches


the monks in the field

thrash and poke their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass  their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field

			abbot
		     sotto
		stay together  together

then another movement catches the abbots eye 
ahead of the monks  the wheat waves against the wind
begins to ripple  the wheat flattens
a trail forms
something is moving in the long grass
moving towards the lead monk  fast

the abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning  even
though the monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him  before he can make a sound the alien closes the gap 
feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

aarghaa !
the lead monk gives one strangled cry before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass  his taper falls
among the long dry stalks  begins to smoke

the abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can  he finds his voice

			abbot
		run!  run!

the monks in the field turn from the spot where the monk
screamed towards the abbot  turn their backs to the now
moving again trail 

			abbot
		no  no  the 

the alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle 
raking through five monks like a scythe through wheat
his tail arms whip out 
snap their spines like kindling
lost torches ignite the wheat

the field bursts into flame
smoke fills the air

in the smoky commotion the monks break rank and start running
weapons in front of them  swinging wildly 
screaming  crying  dying

one frightened monk runs through another with his pitchfork
another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friends chest

and through it all the alien seems to be everywhere
using the chalky smoke for cover as it slashes and tears its way
across the field 


the abbot

frozen in terror to the spot   squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock  hears the wails of defeat
rising up from the wounded

the waving grass is flattened as the alien moves towards him 

he can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon
he climbs down  as his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him  the little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up  he slowly turns

the alien

rises out of the grass in front of the holy man
slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters
its long smooth head is no longer black and slimy

it is golden
its cablelike arms are sheathed in a strawlike covering
it has adapted to the environment of the wheat field  its now
grasslike lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile

the abbot screams and runs


			john o/s
		it isnt your fault you know


int transom space  series of shots

they move across the huge roomanthony a few paces ahead
their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards
wind whistles through the huge room timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling

			ripley
		what

			john
		those things you said before 

ripley remembers her confession

			john
		i read about it in psychology books
		sometimes when people outlive someone
		they cared for they transfer some of
		the guilt for that persons death to
		themselves

			ripley
		i got a belly full of that from the
		psychtechs when i was on earth  yeah
		survivor guilt syndrome or something
		like that  but thats not what i was
		thinking about  i was thinking about
		my friend up there

she looks up

			ripley
		he was on the pod  he killed newt but
		not me  why not me  its almost like
		hes playing with me  maybe they have
		some sort of race memory  maybe he
		knows what i did to his mother
		thats why he didnt just kill me
		that would be too easy  he has to
		torment me

			john
		you make it sound human

			ripley
		hell i dont know what it is

john unconsiously fingers his book

			john
		i think i do


int ladderwell  prison level  night

at the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up
years of damp air have warped the ladder
ripley leads the way torch in her left hand
they climb


int end of prison corridor  fourth level  night

dark  ripley is the first one up
she raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone
the cells here have no doors
she holds her torch in one 
an old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation


at the ladder

john is just climbing off anthony right behind him  
anthony is winded  he reaches up for a helping hand
john looks back and sees that ripley has moved ahead without
them then reaches down to help anthony
their hands clasp 


anthony has a vision

he is seemingly standing in an open field sheep grazing
peacefully at his side
suddenly he is attacked by a horde of medieval demons

fish faced demons  manheaded bird demons
they fly about him grab hold of his limbs
the sheep nearest him opens its mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs sinks them into his ankle 

anthony screams !


ripley

down the corridor hears the scream turns back  sees anthony
fighting with himself struggling against johns grasp 


anthony

balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind 
he jerks 
pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the demon sheep 
off the ladder  forty foot drop waiting below him


john

struggles to keep his death grip on anthonys hand
its all that keeps anthony from falling back down the shaft 

			john
		jesus christ  ripleeeee !

he pulls with all his might


anthony

sees a horrible birddemon grasping his hand in its beak 
biting through his wrist  he waves his staff in the air 
he aims for its head
crack !
whacks johns hand with his staff 

john howls in pain  lets go 

anthony teeters back on one foot arms waving in the air 

ripleys hands shoot out 
grab anthonys cassock 
stop his fall

anthonys eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror 
a terrible wet black cablearmed creature thats latched
itself onto his cassock  long shiny head
ripley has become the alien

whack!
anthony hits the creature with his staff 
hits ripley on the head
whack!
again  in the face

john tries to take hold of anthonys staff arm 
whack!
the cane whips against the side of his head knocking him back
ripley sets her feet and pulls on anthonys cassock 
opens her mouth  grunts 

anthony sees the terrible alien open its maw to devour him

whack! 
his staff connects with the bridge of ripleys nose
she sees flashes of light  loses her balance 
pitches forward starts to go over with anthony 

john grabs them!

wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler lifts and falls backwards  carrying the three of them
into the corridor  whumph!

they land on the floor in a heap
anthony continues to flail about 

ripley and john pin him to the floor between them
finally the vision leaves him
he loses consciousness


john

breathing heavy  opens his eyes 
hes staring right into ripleys face
less than an inch away
hes laying on top of her
shes breathing heavy too
a long uncomfortable moment

			ripley
		thanks

			john
		youre welcome

they roll off each other
her hand goes up to her nose
blood

			ripley
		im all right

john reaches into his bag withdraws a small cotton bag

			john
		hold this against your nose  itll
		stop the flow

she looks over at him questioningly

			john
		im a doctor

she holds the small bag against her nose  the bleeding stops
they move over to anthony  try to help him to his feet
he shakes them off

			anthony
		no  please  just let me sit
		awhile

he rubs his temples  white milklike sweat runs down his
cheek

			anthony
		damn it

			ripley
		what was that

			anthony
		the reason im down here

john points to his own eyes

			john
		visions

			anthony
		dreams

			ripley
		androids cant dream

			anthony
		thats probably what they thought when
		they built me  but my brain is cyber
		organic  patterned after the human
		brain  it functions the same way a
		human brain does  it accumulates random
		images and sensations during waking 
		hours but unlike the human brain that
		sloughs them off during sleep 

			ripley
		androids dont sleep

			anthony
		right  maybe theyve fixed this on later
		models but i dont  do you know what 
		happens to the human brain when it is
		deprived of sleep  it starts to run off
		the dreams while youre awake as 
		hallucinations  same thing with me
		for twenty years i absorbed data on this
		planetoid  a little after we lost contact
		with earth the visions started  they
		thought i was insane  i had to explain 
		that it was because i was an android
		they liked that even less

			ripley
		what did you see

			anthony
		what i always see  images of monsters
		demons

			john
		theyre portents  they stand for an
		evil yet to come

			anthony
		just images ive absorbed from those old
		books and have no way to get rid of

			ripley
		i saw the inside of your cell

			anthony
		     shrugs
		my head is full of them  i try to get
		them out any way i can

his eyelids droop

			john
		you need sleep

			anthony
		i know that  ill settle for rest

he closes his eyes  ripley recovers the torch

			ripley
		stay with him

ripley tried to stand  john takes her arm pulls her down

			john
		no  we all need rest  you especially

ripley considers him

			john
		doctors orders

she smiles and sits

			john
		besides you see what happens when you
		get ahead of us  we should stay together

			ripley
		all right  hes still above us anyway

			john
		what do you mean

			ripley
		ive faced this evil twice before  i
		guess ive gotten sensitive to it 
		     beat
		youre really a doctor

john pats his canvas bag

			john
		see my bag

			ripley
		whats that book

			john
		just a book

			ripley
		i dont buy just a book from a guy who
		says we cant leave the planet without
		the library
			
			john
		its just a medical book i might need

			ripley
		you dont have any food in there do you

			john
		only if you can eat bandages

ripley rubs her midsection

			ripley
		in a few hours thats going to sound
		good  going in and out of suspended
		animation  christ i probably havent
		eaten in a year

			anthony
		    without opening eyes
		you shouldve eaten the bread

			ripley and john
		rest!

ripley lets her head loll back against the wall
closes her eyes  time passes
her brow knits
john sees this

			john
		you all right

			ripley
		aces

			john
		you werent hurt when i landed on you
		bruised a rib

he reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock
feels her midsection  his hands are warm

			ripley
		are you sure youre a doctor

he withdraws his hands

			john
		sort of  my father passed on when we 
		first came here  the abbeys physician 
		father anselm  took me in  he really
		raised me 
			  pause
		taught me what he could before he
		passed away  he was schooled on earth

			ripley
		well im just hungry

			john
		you havent eaten since i took you
		out of your tube

			ripley
		you did that

she reaches out and takes hold of his hands  turns them over

			ripley
		you burned yourself on the escape pod

her hands on his makes him feeluncomfortable

			ripley
		thank you i guess

they look into each others eyes 

			anthony o/s
		you shouldve eaten the bread

ripley embarrassed releases his hands
looks at anthony  hes trying to stand

			anthony
		enough rest  theres beasties afoot

they start into


a narrow corridor

ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them
ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks


int ladder shaft

a great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere
seems at least a mile long
the group climbs


a serpentine corridor

liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head
falls into red puddles on the slanted floor

john kneels dips his fingertips 

			john
		blood
		     sniffs
		mixed with sea water

			anthony
		were getting close to the center of
		the arc  near the sea

			ripley
		blood

			john
		getting close

john hears somthing
raises his hand  stop
the group stops  flatten themselves against the wall

john takes anthonys staff
moves forward with it held out in front of him
whirls around a blind corner 
shoves something against the wall 
thump!
it struggles 

ripley and anthony run up  raise their tapers 
revealing

			ripley
		the abbot

cassock torn dirty  hair eyes wild
anthonys staff across his throat 
john pulls back

			john
		father 

			ripley
		   sarcastic
		what are you doing down here father
		you look like youve seen something
		that doesnt exist

the abbot runs his fingers through his hair  smoothes it down

			abbot
		i was their spiritual leader  i was not
		prepared to lead them in battle
		not against that thing

			john
		no one could be

			ripley
		i thought you said the evil was inside
		me  that sealing me up was the answer
		to all your problems

			abbot
		destruction  the destruction you brought
		to us!

			ripley
		i only tried to warn you

			abbot
		what are you doing with this woman 

			john
		we are going to the technology room
		trying to find some way to fight 

			abbot
		you dont join the devil to fight the
		devil

			anthony
		shes helping us 

			abbot
		look who defends the deceiver  the one
		who isnt even human  john cant you see
		what is happening  on ancient earth
		during the black death  many believed
		that god had abandoned them so they
		appealed to the devil  flocked to him
		hoping to save their bodies  losing their
		souls in the bargain

			ripley
		father were all on the run from the 
		same monster so lets not resort to the
		fire and brimstone routine  ive been
		enlightened about your movement
		pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
		planet of heretics

			john
		please 

the time for pretense is past

			abbot
		all right  i was trying to keep you quiet 

			john
		sir 

			abbot
		i do what i have to do to keep the
		brotherhood together  we all gave up
		believing in earth a long time ago  how
		do you think they would feel if told
		their exiled was in vain  that the
		holocaust they were trying to avoid
		never occured  those men up there have
		grown to live with it

			ripley
		and with you as their leader

the abbot smiles  ripley is sharp

			abbot
		you threatened the status quo

			ripley
		so you protector of knowledge and truth
		lied to them

			abbot
		only about you  the rest i still
		believe  if earth still orbits its sun
		there is no way it could have survived
		being reduced to barbarism

			ripley
		youre as bad as the company

			john
		ripley 

			ripley
		thats why you ran  after all your talk
		death stared you in the face and you
		were afraid

			abbot
		not afraid of death

			ripley
		the alien

			anthony
		the organism

			abbot
		the devil


int technology room corridor

the now four refugees work their way into the final corridor
dark  turns at sharp angles  blind alleys
the floor is uneven wood aged and twisted
warped by years of water dripping from above
the group strings out as it moves into the darkness candles
held high


anthony

bringing up the rear puts his walking stick down 
snapp!!!
everybody stops at the sound

			abbot
		what was that

anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a

			anthony
		man trap

they lower their candles  look to

the floor

interspersed throughout the timbers 
spring jawed steel toothed bear traps
rusted  open  and all around them

			anthony
		in case anyone tried to get in and
		tamper with the technology

the four of them are standing in the middle of a minefield of
man traps  nobody moves

			abbot
		what do we do

			ripley
		dont move  dont breath

			abbot
		we cant just stand here and wait

			ripley
		floors too unstable to try to walk
		around them

john pulls a loose board from the corridor wall
turns and kneels at the trap in front of him
pokes the end of the board into the jaws
snap!!

the others jump at the sound 

			abbot
		john  what are you doing

john pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws
moves to the next trap 
snap!!

			ripley
		hes thinking like a leader  everyone
		grab wood  spring the traps  clear a path
		      proud of him
		good work father john

			john
		brother

			ripley
		brother  lets go

ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her  
exposes a bit of the surface underneath 
its metal

she touches the cool familiar material  smiles
now she knows this is not a dream
she turns and springs the trap in front of her 
snap!!


the four

slowly make their way down the corridor one hand holding a
candle high the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them snapsnapsnap snap
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps


the door to the technology room

a huge wooden door with no knob or handle  looks like it could
almost be part of the wall  john and ripley are the first to
it  they put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase
the abbot joins them


back in the corridor

anthony lags behind  he senses a presence in the hallway
hears a sound behind him
we see a glimpse of something 
he turns towards the sound 

empty hallway

he thinks  starts forward again  with his ear cocked to the
rear snap!


at the door

ripley john and the abbot knock on the door walls
ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion  to get this far and be locked out
she feels sick to her stomach
how long since she had food
she looks over at john
he is staring at her
he turns red at being caught  cute

			john
		i just  are you allright

			ripley
		tied  without sleep food  i just
		feel my age
		       smiles
		figuring hyperspace time im almost a
		hundred

she wipes her brow and goes back to knocking

			john
		hello

the wall beneath his fist sounds hollow
fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull 
the plank slides aside on tiny rusty pneumatic pistons


behind the plank

a primitive keyboard  circa late twentieth century

			john
		i think this is it

ripley and the abbot move over to see

			abbot
		technology

			ripley
		yeah  a hundred years ago  an antique

			abbot
		     to ripley
		go ahead

			ripley
		go ahead and what

			abbot
		open the door woman

			ripley
		ill get to it but listen to me 
		you may dress like youre living in
		the middle ages but you cant treat
		me like your chambermaid or whatever
		monks had


up the hall  anthony

hears the sound again  turns
nothing again
he pauses turns back quickly 

the wooden wall moves  steps forward 


the alien

adapted itself to look like wood

its body changes  transmutes  cablelike sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio
mechnoid alien appearance!


anthony pov

the weary android sees the alien as a conglommoration of his
many medieval images of demons  he hears the aliens hollow
raspy breath  it glides towards him

anthony steps back directly into a trap as his mind goes 
snap!!
the steel jaws spring shut on his left ankle
milky bloodfluid starts to flow

he finds himself in the same predicament as his vision 
ankle pinned the aliens appendages circling him 
he screams  aaaaaaaaaaaargh !


at the door

ripley is trying to work  she punches numbers into the keyboard
she is too exhausted to see straight
they hear the scream 
john runs back 
traps snapping around him 
ripley turns towards the sound 
the abbot pushes her back to the keyboard 

			abbot
		open it!!

ripley knits her brows  forces herself to focus
her fingers punch the keys


the alien

steps towards anthony 
snapsnapsnapap!!
traps snap closed on its tail its legs 


halfway down the hall  john

snap!!
his cassock is snagged in a trap
he tears right out of it 
at the end of the hall

anthony is in the clutches of the alien
he whacks at the beast with his staff but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant

the alien lifts him up to face him  anthony screams as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the traps chain 
blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle


face to face with the alien

anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the aliens arms with
his own android arms  his extrahuman strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth eyeless face

the alien considers him  its thin almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinterlike teeth  the jaws spread
making room for the distended tongue

the alien hisses 
puts out anthonys eyes with a thin stream of acidic saliva 
artificial skin bubbles and blisters 


john

picks up anthonys staff
begins to flail away at the demon


at the door

ripley is getting no response from the keyboard

			abbot
		whats wrong!

ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment
the wires are so old theyve broken

			ripley
		shit

she bites the ends off the wires  spits out the insulation
twists the bare wire ends together
sweat runs into her eyes


john

whacks the alien with anthonys staff 
again  again  the creature will not let anthony go
the android writhes in its grasp his face now a blistered
pulpy mass eyes gone


ripley

finishes hot wiring  the keyboard hums to life
her fingers fly across the keys 


the alien

tail wraps around johns waist 
pulls him towards it 
lifts him  turns him upside down 

lips pull back 

johns hands grope at the floor 

sharp metal teeth spread 


the door keyboard

lights  code accepted
ripleys head whips towards the corridor 


john

his hand closes around the end of one of the traps 
he brings it up 
snap!!
it slams closed on the aliens extended tongue !
the beast bellows!!
whips its head from side to side 
cant shake off the trap 
acid blood sprays out !
lands as pools of fire on the wooden floor


the door

opens with a strained blast of dust  seewhorcssh!
the abbot leaps inside 

			ripley
		its open!!


john

pries anthonys ankle out of his trap
scoops up his staff drags the moaning android 
back up the corridor 


ripley

stands in open technology room doorway 

			abbot
		close it  close it  its coming 

			ripley
		we wait  john!!

john and anthony appear out of the shadows 
run/hobble towards the door 


the alien

acid blood dissolves the traps steel jaws  pulls itself free
head whips towards the escaping monks  if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger 
runs up the hall 


ripley

follows john and anthony into the technology room
on the other side of the doorway another keyboard
she punches keys 

			abbot
		hurry 

			john
		hurry!!


the alien

yards away  limping  hissing
angry


the keyboard

acceptance tone bings
the door starts to slide down 

the alien is feet away 
inches

the door seats itself closed with a solid thud

ripley panting rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door  a beat
she turns to the room for the first time and finds 


windmills

real man of lamancha wood and cloth windmills  two story high
arms slowly rotating  moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnellike room  as far as the eye can see
turning creaking
whooshwhoosh
but no electronics  no radio  no weapons
this is the technology room

ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness  

							dissolve to

int sulaco escape ship #4 dream

yellow warning lights pulse  those goddamned strobes are
flickering on and off  steam blasts out overhead pipes

the bluespark pilot light muzzles of a flame thrower shyly
pokes out from behind a console  its owner cautiously
follows


ripley

shes breathing heavy
shes wearing a sweat soaked tank top
her eyes flit from side to side  then up  then down
she pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod
she silently crosses the distance to newts sleep tube


in the tube

newt sleeps peacefully
ripley allows herself one maternal smile then remembers
her grip tightens in the flame thrower in her hands
she flips a switch to hi heat
moves around the sleep tubes

a noise to her left
she whirls 

pulls the trigger on the flame thrower  click  nothing
she tries again  a halfhearted burp but no flame
she begins to panic 

senses the aliens presence
looks left right up  no alien
looks down

the aliens tail is coming up between her legs
she turns 

right into its grasp
the useless flamethrower skitters across the floor
she pummels the beast with balled up fists

			ripley
		no  no!  i beat you!  i beat you mother
		fucker!!

the alien spins her  pushes her over across the sleep tube 
like its taking her from behind!

ripley looks down into the sleep tube

newt is gone
her dolls head lays in a pool of blood
the alien wraps his arms around ripley
thin lips pull back for a kiss

she screams


int technology room  reality  day

ripley opens her eyes
whooshwhoosh
shes still in the room with the windmills
somehow this place seems less real than her dream
she looks around

john is sitting next to her writing on a piece of parchment
he smiles a relieved smile

			john
		i thought wed lost you

			ripley
		what are you writing

			john
		last will and testament
		      beat
		just kidding

she looks to her left
anthony is lying on his back cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes  his ankle is a swollen mess  wires are hanging out

			ripley
		is he 

			john
		resting
		      shakes his head
		hell be fine

			anthony
		no i wont  hes a terrible liar

			ripley
		im sorry

			anthony
		its ironic  i guess my visions were
		prescience after all  how will i ever
		resolve that with my artifical con
		science

a creaking floorboard to ripleys right draws her attention to
the abbot  hes pacing

			abbot
		do you see what youve delivered us
		into

			ripley
		yeah  lead me not into temptation to
		kick your  ahh 

ripley tries to stand  her head spins
whooshwhoosh

			ripley
		oh shit

the entire room throbs with the rhythm of the wind

			ripley
		where is the big boy 

the abbot points to the door

			abbot
		on the other side of that door
		waiting for us to starve to death

ripley moves to the door and feels its cold surface

			ripley
		its playing with us  it could get in
		here any time it wants

			abbot
		why should he enter  he knows that one
		of the people in this room is in league
		with him

			john
		sir  were all in the same coracle so
		to speak

			abbot
		maybe more than one of us

			ripley
		lets talk about the facts mr abbot

she looks at the windmills
whooshwhoosh

			ripley
		this is your technology

			abbot
		even this is forbidden to us

			ripley
		well then the facts are that were screwed

she moves into the room  walks around one of the windmills

			ripley
		an eco system  nothing to recycle your
		atmosphere except the green plants  winds
		generated down here 
		     looks at the floor
		windmills use the natural surface winds
		to turn wheels underground create tides
		on the seas to recirculate your water

			anthony
		more than that  there are pumps beneath
		the floor  i can feel their vibration

			ripley
		probably pumping this air through charcoal
		filters

whooshwhoosh

			ripley
		it gets colder all the time here right

john looks at her questioningly

			john
		yes

			ripley
		your wood burning fires throw soot into
		the atmosphere building the cloud layer 
		cutting off the suns rays  cooling the
		planet forcing you to burn more wood

whooshwhoosh

			anthony
		the greenhouse effect  its how the earth
		almost destroyed itself in the late 20th
		century

			ripley
		dont you see  this is a planet set to
		self destruct  not in ten minutes or two
		hours but soon  your atmosphere here is
		finite  if the plants die the fires will
		eat up all the oxygen  this planetoid
		will be dead  everyone will die

the abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a marathon

			abbot
		its here  i was just hoping i would be
		dead long before it came to this

			john
		what

			abbot
		were supposed to die here  thats the point

			ripley
		wait a minute  you were exiled 

			abbot
		the punishment for our crime was death

anthony sits up

			anthony
		this planet is the supreme triumph of
		planned obsolesence  a certain amount of
		primitive materials with an atmosphere
		processing system as fragile as a real
		environment but not replenishable

the abbot has a faraway look in his eyes

			abbot
		poetic justice for the antitechnologists
		the companys best work  you know i used
		to be a corporate executive  middle range
		vp  then my wife got hit by a speed craft
		i chucked it all and joined the order
		be a monk  see the world  being here
		being chairman of the board

			ripley
		no now i understand why i landed here
		to join you happy lunatics in your 
		deaths

ripley moves away
john starts after her

			john
		ripley wait 

the abbot stands blocks his way

			abbot
		where can she go  shes trapped
		       beat
		trapped inside her own prison  a prison
		in her mind  inside her mind  dancing
		sparklets of light  dance with the june
		bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare
		coming to danceintheshadowof

john and ripley turn to look at the abbot
he begins to speak faster  faster
he shakes  vibrates is more accurate 
a trickle of blood runs from his left ear

			abbot
		ridingthewildwindsofchangenoescapeno
		escapeforthewickedevilevilthynameis
		womanwomanwomanheiscomingheiscoming
		foryouuuuuuuuu *

splortchkt!!
the abbots head explodes !!!
like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement
blood bone hair and brain matter spray john
john screams


a horrible alien head burster

is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the abbot
it keeps its hold on the abbots spinal cord  the abbots
body continues to stagger around arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system

ripley screams
the infant alienheaded corpse stumbles towards her 
she plucks anthonys staff from the floor and swings 
 like a child hitting a baseball from a tee 
whackk !!
blasts the chest/head burster across the room 

it hits the floor scrambling  scuttles down into where the
windmills meet the floor  disappears

			ripley
		bastard!!  it came out of his fucking
		head!

			anthony
		i didnt have to see that to know what
		that means

			ripley
		he sent him to us  that bastard outside
		i cant get away from him  hes fucking
		with my mind  hes my punishment!

			anthony
		im confused  before you said it came out
		of the torso not the head 

			ripley
		i dont feel like a discussion of alien biology

john comes up next to her

			john
		ripley dont 

she pushes him away and sinks to the floor

			ripley
		i should just wait for the air to run out

			john
		i believe  i know  that we can win 
		there is an answer in our books

			ripley
		your books  your books are gone brother
		your world is gone  once that thing starts
		to lay its eggs all your brothers  if
		they arent already  are dead

			john	
		if thats true then all of us the books
		are consigned to ashes

he clasps his hands and bows his head
the abbots blood drips off his hands
plip  plop!
into a little puddle at ripleys feet
she stares at the blood  aahk
feels the pain again
runs her hand across her chest

			anthony o/s
		ripley

			ripley
		what

			anthony
		there are several inconsistancies between
		this and the other aliens you described

			ripley
		give it up

			anthony
		i think this is important  this may help
		us fight it  the creature that i fought
		in the hall  when i first saw it it had
		camoflaged itself to look like wood

ripley looks up
			
			ripley
		wood  when i saw it in my room it looked
		the way it did before  black mechanical 
		unless that was a dream

			anthony
		i dont think it was  i think that this 
		creature if it is the efficient predator
		that you say it is has the ability to
		adapt to its environment

			ripley
		then the reason theyve always looked the
		same to me is that i only ever saw them in
		the same environment

			anthony
		or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
		development  you saw a queen  this
		could be like a king ant  more highly
		advanced than the drone bred for 
		survival 

			john
		how does this explain the thing that came
		out of the ewes chest  the abbots head

			ripley
		maybe it can deposit different types of
		eggs  the chest burster is probably
		dormant until the host eats  the first
		one i ever saw came out of kane after he
		started to eat 

and in one horrible moment she realizes
she hasnt eaten  the pain in her chest

			ripley
		no

anthony looks towards her  does he realize as well

			john
		no what

			ripley
		no were not beat yet father 

			john
		brother 

ripley gets up

			ripley
		brother  not yet  if hes taunting me
		then maybe we can use that  we can beat
		this bastard  we can get to my ship
		we can live

								cut to

int technology room

john stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling  holds a torch
ripley is on the ground with anthony his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him  skin is palid

			anthony
		dont have second thoughts  blind and
		crippled i would only slow you down
		give him time to figure out what youre
		doing  just leave me my staff

			ripley
		okay  good luck

she shakes his hand  he pulls her closer
anthonys empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at ripley

			anthony
		ripley i know  good luck

			ripley
		sit tight

ripley crosses to john  poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling

			ripley
		he could be waiting on the other side
		of that door  we might not get ten feet
		before he kills the three of us

he shakes his head

			john
		we had better go then

he smiles
she smiles back
they move up the ladder

it leads up a damp short shaft walls green with algae to


an underground dock  night

the ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier  ripley and john
climb out onto the wooden structure  before them

an underground sea stretches the width of the entire planet
over five miles across  the floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead

the water sparkles with a golden glow

			john
		must be day on the surface of the planet

			ripley
		where is the light coming from
	
			john
		mirrors  reflect the outside light down
		great shafts  through lenses  thats
		what they make in the glass factory 
		lenses  look 

she turns

a huge waterfall

lit from within by daylight beaming down from above  pours
into the sea a short distance from them

			john
		opens to the surface  water flows in
		and out  i dont know how  theres one
		at either end  i came down on the other
		side

			ripley
		what do we do

john points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes

			john
		we cross


int technology room  day

anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills  he winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff  it sparks
the large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head
the wind blows through his hair
whooshwhoosh
feels good

anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his eyes

			anthony
		now the seer can only see what god wants
		him to  forty years on a planet of monks
		and ive finally found religion

a floor board creaks
anthony strains to hear

			anthony
		john  ripley

whooshwhoosh
he knows it is not

			anthony
		well come then  i havent got forever

a shadow falls across his face  he can feel it
he doesnt have to see what is here


the underground ocean  day into night

the leather boat makes its way across the sea
john rows while ripley holds the torch aloft
as night falls she takes the oars

the ocean is dead calm  the coracle glides across the glass
like surface  john flexes his scarred fingers

			ripley
		your hands okay

			john
		theyll be fine  youve been on
		a boat before

ripley squints ahead of them
the ocean seems to go on forever

			ripley
		i was a warrant officer on a ship 
		but i did all my sailing in space

			john		
		father anselm used to take me on his
		coracle when i was little

ripley leans forward  scans his face

			ripley
		how old were you when they towed
		this satellite out here	

			john
		five  the abbot said they put us to 
		sleep for the thirty years it took
		to get here  weve had almost forty
		more  until now

			ripley
		what happened to your mother

			john
		never had one  i mean never knew her
		i mean i did once  she left my father
		when he joined the movement  if she
		hadnt i wouldnt be here  they kept
		the other children with the women on
		earth  that was too long ago now  like
		a dream

ripleys face grows strangely dark  she turns to the water

			ripley
		did you know that i was a mother

			john
		the girl in the ship with 

			ripley
		no  on earth  i never mentioned my
		daughter  my daughter  i have  had
		i guess by now  a daughter on earth
		kathy  she was nine when i signed on to
		the nostromo  mommy will be home before
		you know it i said  my shares would have
		set us up good  then i lost sixty years
		floating around in a rescue pod  thanks
		to the alien  i came home to face a bitter
		70 year old woman  my daughter  a little
		girl whos mother never came home

			john
		jesus christ

			ripley
		they said i should have been happy to be
		alive  funny huh  thats why i went
		back the second time  not so i could
		fight it  you cant fight it  so
		i could let it kill me

she rubs her chest 

			john
		you didnt choose to get lost in space

			ripley
		thanks for the try father 

			john
		brother

			ripley
		brother but im not looking for absolution
		i couldnt be a good mother to my daughter
		i couldnt be a good mother to newt  but
		i can be a good mother to you  i can make
		sure you survive

suddenly they feel rain 
ripley holds out her hand
her eyes open wide at what she sees
john takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side

the ocean has become red with blood
blood drips down from the ceiling around them

			ripley
		blood

john looks up

			john
		from the levels above

his face goes white

			john
		he must have slaughtered all 

			ripley
		dont think about it  dont think about
		whats up there  just row

as ripley takes the torch away from the water tiny ripples move
across the surface
she doesnt notice


a shape

passes underneath the boat  a swimming creature  the alien
thanks to the reflective qualities of water it appears huge
dwarfs their coracle


int technology room  night

all the windmills are burning
flaming arms lazily turning
anthony is not in sight
whooshwhoosh


the other side of the ocean  night

another dock with ladders going up and down
ripley and john climb out of the coracle
dont waste time tying off  they go  


up the ladder

a hundred foot climb  the wood is twisted
rungs have been torn away in some places
they pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold  the temperature rises as they do
sweat runs into their eyes

soon they can see the floor above them
blackened by intense heat
they climb


int underground wheat fields  night

ripley and john come up from the level below

			ripley
		holy shit

john crosses himself

another testament to the terrible battle with the alien
reduced to just a huge blackened floor
all the crops burned to ash 
their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted monks
their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead 
ripley would puke if she had any food in her body

			john
		theres andrew  and raphael  peter

			ripley
		stop  how far

			john
		were right below the abbey now

they cross the smoldering field
the scorched floor threatens to give way under johns feet 
ripley pull him to one side


the monastery level

heaven has become hell
the ground the buildings the skytimber  all blackened
fires burn everywhere  air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the orbiters surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling


ripley and john

climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off its 
hinges  they look at the grim tableau

monks impaled on their own pikes
tangled together in their own pungy stakes
alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies


the monastery

flickering fires lit the first few floor windows
ripley takes a step towards it 
reaches back and pulls john


int glass factory  night

the glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow
small fires burn out of control around the room
finished glass pieces burst from the heat
ripley and john enter

			john
		this is the glassworks  they have
		tools here 
			spots
		kyle 

he runs across the room 


brother kyle

sits calmly at the marver table
he places playing cards on the table in front of him
solitaire  
he sings to himself quietly

			kyle
		     sotto
		cant see my baby
		dont see my baby  bay be

john grabs him by the lapels  pulls him to his feet
the playing cards fall to the floor 
kyle watches them not john

			john
		kyle  brother kyle

			kyle
		cards on the floor fifty two pickup
		black king on red queen put the
		ace up 

john shakes him

			john
		kyle goddammit!

ripley moves closer

			ripley
		john  its too late 

kyle begins to sing faster  faster

			kyle
		ace up  put the ace up  redaceupup
		blackaceupuppuppuppupchaka
		boomloommawhacka  booomalooma
		looma 

ripley and john look at each other
they know what this means
john pulls a length of rope off a nearby table
moves in front of kyle  looks into his glassy eyes
a tear runs down his cheek

			john
		keep singing my friend

john loops the rope around kyles neck
strangles him
eases the lifeless body to the floor
stares at it


ripley

pulls a blowing iron from the rack  feels its weight and
balance  a reasonable weapon  she crosses to john

			john
		i killed him  im a doctor and i
		killed him

			ripley
		you had to  youre supposed to end
		suffering

she hands him a pontil a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes

			ripley
		lets get the hell out of here


int stairwell  night

ripley and john move up the stairs
flickering orange lit from below
smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors


int library  night

they enter carefully  the room is exactly as john left it
books out of shelves hanging on their chains

			ripley
		hes made a mess

john pushes ahead of her

			john
		no  he hasnt been up here yet  i 
		did this

he moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock 

			john
		here  philosophy  well start here 

aaaroo !
a hairy blur flies out from between the stacks 
whumph!  knocks john to the floor 
licks his face

			john
		mattias!

the happy dog leaps all over his master

			john		
		he waited  ripley this is mattias  my
		dog  good fellow

ripley crosses to them

			ripley
		im glad  really  but weve probably
		only got a few minutes before this
		entire place goes up in flames  just
		grab whatever books you want and 

ripley leans in to pet mattias
mattias draws his lip back  growls
hes looking over ripleys shoulder

she turns around slowly


the alien

standing in the open doorway
its in bad shape from the man traps
lost a foot  tongue hanging out useless
parts of it look like wood  parts of it look like wheat

it carries anthonys waterlogged limp body 
pops off his head like a grape from the bunch
tosses the corpse at ripleys feet

i could swear its trying to smile


ripley and john

back against the book stacks
john grabs mattias collar
the dog growls at the alien intruder

			john
		easy boy

			ripley
		is there another way out

			john
		not that will do us any good


the alien

limps into the room dragging one foot
its breathing is labored  dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it

			john
		we hurt it

the alien draws itself up to its full height 
even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker

			ripley
		you wanna give it a bandage  look 
		where is my ship from here

			john
		on the roof directly above this room

			ripley
		heres the plan 
		
			john
		but the books 

			ripley
		forget the books!

ruff!!
mattias pulls free from johns grasp 
runs to the alien 

			ripley
		shit


mattias

snaps and barks at the alien 
leaping about to dodge its claws
draws its attention 


ripley and john

run at the alien
it is trying to spear the dog with its tail
john swings the iron rod  thwap !
hits the alien across the back of its bulbous head 

it turns to him 

spliiiitch !
ripley shoves the blowing iron into the aliens torso
his acid blood spurts out the end of the hollow tube 
splatters ripleys cassock  she tears it off 

john grabs mattias  pulls him back

the alien spins in a circle 
blood spraying around him 

creating a circle of fire about him 
igniting the books 

			john
		no!  the books!!

			ripley
		dont !

john steps forward  ripley grabs for him 
the acid eats through the wooden floor 


the floor collapses

the alien john and ripley plummet down !
through the next floor 


into the glassworks

the alien falls into the molten glass vat 
screeches  arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid


john

finds himself hanging over the bubbling glass vat  caught 
dangling on the flying fox rope  five feet away  the ledge the
flying fox is launched from  he looks down

he can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him  to its
right the water dump tank  a large wine casklooking affair
where finished pieces are cooled  he looks up

ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above

			john
		are you all right

ripley grunts an affirmative response
at least is she falls it will only be a twentyfoot drop to
the floor  john is looking at instant parboiling
john starts to move hand over hand up the rope  he begins to
sweat
a drop of sweat falls
hsss!
pops and sizzles as it hits the surface of the molten glass 


ripley

tries to pull herself up to the floor above 
the next level is a raging fire

she can only hang and drop  she does !
falls the two stories
bends her knees and rolls on impact


john

has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace
he stands  sees ripley slowly rising 

			john
		ripley !

ripley shakily gets to her feet
hops on one foot

			ripley
		aargh  im fine  lets get the fuck
		out of 

suddenly

the aliens head breaks the surface of the molten glass
screaming  steaming  it is whitehot 
translucent  covered with  
it looks like molten glass!!

hooklike hands grasp the edge of the tank 
it tries to climb out 

ripley turns to run  tender ankle gives out
she falls face down on the floor 
rolls over 

the alien is going to climb out of the vat 
she screams 


john

grabs the flying fox handle
swings down the rope  across the room 
past the alien 

it turns away from ripley 
she scrambles across the floor

john lands hard
points 

			john
		ripley  the lever!!

ripley looks next to her  a burning wooden lever

the alien has one foot out of the glass furnace 

ripley grabs the lever  hssssst!
putting out the fire with her hand 
pulls 


the huge dump tank of water

dumps  empties a thousand gallons 
rains down on the alien 
it howls in pain 

the molten glass instantly cools 
the rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
bethwoooooooom !!
explode into a million pieces!!!!

ripley helps john off the floor
they are battered  bloody
they look into the vat
the steam clears

the room is littered with alien bits
each piece is encased in glass 
trapped like a fly in amber

			john
		saw that happen to a bottle once

			ripley
		    panting
		beat beat him  ugh 

she grabs her stomach as her knees give out
john gives her an arm for support

			john
		weve got to get to the library 

			ripley
		dont worry  ship  just 

they look up

mattias looks down through the hole in the floor
barks


int library  night

an inferno
every bookshelf ablaze  the floor dotted with pools of flame
ripley and john are at the door  held back by the heat 

john tries to enter the room 
ripley grabs him 

			ripley
		dont be stupid 

			john
		some of them!  ive got to save some of
		them!  mattias!!

mattias yelps in response  threads his way through to them
ripley spins him to face her  tears stream down his cheeks

			ripley
		theyre lost  you did your best  if
		you get out it wasnt in vain
		weve got to live!!

she yanks him into the hallway 

							cut to

ext monastery  the roof  night

ripleys good foot kicks down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship  john and mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship  john looks around

the abbey level is devastated  the air is filled with smoke
the abbey is burning  the library is in flames

john looks down at his medical bag
torn bloody scorched it still hangs from his shoulders
inside the only remaining book

			ripley o/s
		come on in!

john and mattias step through 


int sulacco escape pod #4  night

ripley clicks on the lights
john lifts mattias into the hatch

			john
		the library 

			ripley
		i told you  the earth is still there 

ripley checks an instrument  elapsed travel time
her brows knit  she taps the gauge

			ripley
		not working

			john
		what does that mean

			ripley
		it means i dont know how long i was
		in hyper sleep

			john
		it means the abbot couldve been right 
		
			ripley
		it means my clock isnt working  we have
		to get out of here  even if he was right
		this ships onboard computer is filled 
		with mans knowledge

			john
		not everything  some things will be
		lost forever 

			ripley
		then man starts over  hes done it
		before

she pushes a few buttons  somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source hums to life  throbbing through the soles
of johns feet  ripley is absorbed in her work

			ripley
		okay  the seals werent broken so
		were probably clear  but those dead
		monks out there are going to start
		hatching soon  lets get ready to
		take off

			john
		what can i do

			ripley
		here i need a compressor tank from
		in that compartment

she motions towards an open door
john enters the compartment
whooshclang !
the door closes behind him

			john
		hey!  what!

he looks out the window in the door  

ripley is staring at him punching keys on a pad next to the
door

			john
		hey  im locked in

mattias scratches at the door

			ripley
		i know  i locked you in

			john
		what

			ripley
		im not going with you  ive got one
		inside me
	
			john
		what!  you cant 

she runs a hand across her midsection

			ripley
		i figured it out  thats why it didnt
		kill me  he must have impregnated me
		when i was in the stasis tube
		    remembers nightmare
		it hasnt come out yet because i 
		havent eaten its still dormant  so
		either i eat and it kills me or i dont
		eat and i starve to death  either way 
		i die

john pulls the medieval tome out of his medical bag

			john	
		my book  i know what to do 

			ripley
		what an exorcism  no good

			john
		you cant do this  ripley  listen
		to me  youre confusing feeling of
		guilt for actual sin  i can help you 

			ripley
		    ignoring
		ive set a time lock  when the pod escapes
		the colonys gravitational pull this
		compartment will open  then all you have 
		to do is get into the stasis tube with
		mattias and press the blue button  with
		any luck a freighter or something will
		pick you up  good luck

he pounds his fists against the door

			john
		no!  no goddammit  you cant do this
		you cant let it win

she turns away from the door

			ripley
		it always wins  we killed it but its
		still inside me  youre my last chance
		if i can keep you alive itll make up
		for all those ive lost

			john
		listen to me!  you have to let me try!
		ripley  youre my only chance!

shes listening

			john
		i told you father anselm raised me
		he raised me and when he was dying i
		couldnt do anything to save him  i 
		didnt know enough  it was my fault
		he died  if you dont let me try to
		save you my body will live but my soul
		will be dead

ripley turns and stares at him

			john
		please

								cut to


the page

a medieval etching
a monk vomits up the devil

pull back as john lowers ripley to the pod floor
john closes his eyes
closes the book

he pours some water into a small plastic cup
retrieves a small pouch of herbs  opens it
wrinkles his nose  they smell 
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup

			ripley
		what is this stuff

			john
		     forceful
		something that will make you well
		something that will make you sick

			ripley
		i dont 

			john
		shut up and drink

he lifts the back of ripleys head 
forces the drink down her throat

john swings his leg over her midsection  straddles her
presses his two hands together in prayer
then balls them into one fist
takes a deep preparatory breath

ripley starts to gag  cough
her body starts to jerk 

john brings his fist down into her stomach 
whamm !!

ripley convulses  has the dry heaves 

wham!  wham !
john pummels ripleys diaphragm!

she sputters  vomits a thick mucouslike substance 
heaves 

ripleys back arches 
she screams a gut wrenching wail 
her torso bulges as the creature is forced upwards

john bears down 
pushes up under her ribs 
forcing the chestburster up her throat 

ripley fights for air as the alien stops halfway up her 
esophagus  shes choking 

john crosses himself  takes a deep breath 
lowers his mouth to hers 
inhales  exhales  cpr


the alien chest burster

slithers out of ripleys mouth 

into johns!!
reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet

john falls back against a computer console
gagging  fights to speak

ripley raises herself up on one elbow
alien mucous drooling down her chin
hair matted against her forehead

			ripley
		why
	
			john
		choking  it was the only way

he drops the open book in front of her
she sees the etching


john

gulps back the oozing slime
struggles to his feet

			john
		they knew

			ripley
		but you 

ripley tries to stand  to go after him 
she cant sit up  feels like a rib might be cracked

			ripley
		youll die 

john stumbles to the pod door  turns back

			john	
		thats idea  joinmy brothers  if
		we were right heaven  if we were wrong 
		either way where we belong  world of
		books  pages

he draws the parchment out of his bag
drops it to the floor

			john
		you are from the real world

he starts to step through the door 
mattias tries to follow

			john
		stay  both of you

he exits the pod

ripley drags herself across the floor

			ripley
		no  wait!  john!

to the door  looks out


brother john

dawns rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof
into the inferno that is the burning abbey

ripley watches as john and the alien horror inside him are
incinerated

the heat of the flames grows
she must pull back 
reaches up for the door handle
it closes with a thud

she rolls onto her back
she weeps  for the first time in years
shes been absolved

creeeek !!
the escape pod shifts
ripleys eyes snap open 

the roof beneath the pod is beginning to give way

ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilots chair  pulls herself into the seat
straps herself in 


sulacco escape pod #4

blasts through the wooden outershell of the orbiter arceon
roars towards us  past us


int sulacco escape pod #4 = day

ripley places mattias into the hyper sleep tube
rubs under his chin  is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor 


johns parchment

ripley picks it up and unrolls it
she hears johns voice

			john vo
		i brother john goldman of the orbiter
		arceon minorite abbey and gaol know
		the abbot was wrong  there is a great
		evil here  i have seen it  i put pen to
		paper now lest this plague  this creature
		stills my hand  i have gone down below 
		both to try to warn the others and get 
		the woman  ripley  get from her some
		clue as to how to battle this evil or
		at least to make my peace for not
		defending her  she believes there is
		still and earth and i hope she is right
		i hope she will be able to find out
		i hope she can find some rest for the
		devils that torment her

ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console  pulls a pen from its holder  she adds

			ripley vo
		whether the earth exists or not whether
		we end up in heaven or hell or the cold
		vacuum of space she has

she sets her course
gets back into her tube
closes the lid


deep space

the escape pod moves through the jetblack void


arceon

dwindles into the darkness behind her a smouldering slowly
dying ember

							the screen goes black


end credits roll


		teenager in the back of the movie theater shouts
				its in the dog!
