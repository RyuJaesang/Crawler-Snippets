     a beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains

               im not going to tell it as good as
               stephen you two kicked around
               till your early teens then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in st petersburg
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the diamond dog
               and he was your fagin and stephen
               was his artful dodger but it ended
               suddenly and badly

                         bloom
               stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier

                         rose
               why did he do that

                         bloom
               and then the brothers bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves sounds
               romantic

     she pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table her face inches from blooms eyes closed expecting a
     kiss

     blooms eyes stay open

                         bloom
               you want to know how stephen did
               it with charleston

               he positioned me in the same spot
               where seven years ago
               charlestons wife stood and told
               him she was leaving

     the room transforms becomes daylit not on fire seven years

               he chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit

     sure enough the colors and shape of blooms suit matches the
     wifes outfit

                         bloom os contd
               he even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers

                         wife
               this is the end charelston youve
               always been a dunce

     putting the broom aside a moment the old man walks painfully
     across the street to bloom standing nearly toe to toe with
     him the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face

     he then smears his hand over his mug pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on blooms mouth when he takes his
     hand away bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile the old man winks at him and walks back to his broom

     then recognizes shes doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked oh yes go on smile/nod then does it
     all again three or four times

                            bloom
                  didnt really have anyone except
                  each other growing up and our
                  father was in the antique business
                  he had a shop in charleston so we
                  stuck together my brother stephen
                  and me we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died then we
                  realized one day we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world and there was a almost a
                  scent they had when theyd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen the
                  air would like before a rain the
                  ions would line up and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to paris
                  and steamer ships and calcutta
                  bazaars and we made the decision
                  we just did it that we want to
                  have that sort of life so we did
                  and weve been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since and could you im sorry
                  stop doing  that youre im ok

                  how was it lonely

                            penelope
                  fishing for an entertaining
                  childhood anecdote that
                  encapsulates my adult issues

                            bloom
                  well its funny how everyones
                  usually got one

     as penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles

                            penelope
                  when i turned six i started getting
                  allergies hayfever rashes really
                  bad so my mom took me into the
                  doctor and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins to see which ones youre
                  allergic to the next day i came
                  in the doctor lifted up my shirt
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily moldy blackish green double
                  puff marshmallows i was allergic
                  to everything so they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system and i spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors mostly alone lonely

     she pulls the queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table

                         bloom
               wow

                         penelope
               it wasnt til i was nineteen they
               discovered what i was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of then i was going to leave but
               my mom got sick so i stayed and
               she stayed sick a long time

                         bloom
               do you feel cheated

     penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens

                         penelope
               the trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat so i
               decided this wasnt a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated it was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything any little
               thing and do anything she decided
               to do and love the person she was
               trapped with so i told myself
               that story until it became true
               now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life or did it just blind
               me so i wouldnt want to escape it
               i dont know but either way i
               was the one telling my own story
               so i dont feel cheated

     she finishes the trick

     a single pair of hands clapping turns their heads at the
     far end of the deck alone at a table the large man in the
     fur collared cape who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called the curator

                         the curator
               and a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician   my
               compliments

     bloom takes penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away

                                                                 46

     they stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship

                         penelope
               who is that man you avoided him
               earlier on the deck

                         bloom
               i dont know but hes carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape do me a favor and steer
               clear of him

     a waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen

               i dont suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance

                         penelope
               i went through a phase when i was
               mildly obsessed with the bolero

                         bloom
               give me a minute

     he leaves her alone clouds obscure the moon shadows
     deepen she shivers

     a match strikes   she jumps

     the moon reemerges and she is no longer alone on the deck
     the curator lights a dapper briar pipe shakes out the match

                  apologies but the deck was dark
                  and i had to approach
                      english
                  its been such a time since ive
                  encountered the brothers bloom

                            penelope

                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with

     the band strikes up a bolero the curator flicks his wrist
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand

                            the curator contd
                  a little fear might suit you i
                  think

     he raises the blade it is in fact a fine mustache brush
     which he delicately employs

                            the curator contd
                  bon soir ma cherie

     with that the curator backs into the shadows and is gone
     moments later bloom trots up to her oblivious

                            bloom
                  it isnt a spanish band but
                  theyll do their best

     he hands her a single blood red rose she puts it in her
     teeth and they dance if there is a tinge of tension in the
     air the bolero suits it

     the moon ducks behind a cloud once more and they dance on in
     the dark

                and one day the boy was walking
                home and he quarrelled he fought
                with a good friend of his they
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died the boys friend was very
                sad but also very frightened so
                instead of telling the boys
                parents he did something awful
                he pulled the body into a quarry a
                pit of broken rocks and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones
                well years went by and the boys
                friend became a young man and one
                day while drinking in town which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest with the
                stones from the quarry he ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty no stones no body he
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry he asked expecting maybe
                hoping theyd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot but no
                they said motioning to the well
                nothing strange just stones
                they left him alone there at the
                well and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep still silence

      the last image we land on is the well alone in the clearing

      its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows

      then with a piercing roar a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well animated and terrifying grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well

      silence again we pull out of the painting back to the
      curator sitting very still

                the next morning we found her in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property i climbed down to her
                but slipped and broke my leg and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms
                if youve had a child my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing to hold her and make her
                feel safe but no matter what i
                said to her i couldnt stop her
                shaking crying her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror of a stone golem

      he stands opens the blinds pours another drink

                it was the first painting i
                acquired i keep it maybe hoping

                me

      she gives him the envelope with the certified check he
      shakes her hand then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a childs

      he lets go and smiles apologetically

                   the literal translation is
                   something about water cranes but
                   essentially it means when youre

      miles from nowhere plays from a nearby radio

      his eye catches something       a shiny red apple on a fruit
      sellers cart

      he approaches it slowly face flushed breath shallow eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance

      holy shit    he is going to steal that apple

      deftly he passes lifting and pocketing it just as the vendor
      turns away bloom has done it his pale face tightens

      and sees a five year old boy      giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement

      screaming dogs bark people stare and bloom sprints
      apple in hand a joyful smile forming on his lips

      bloom lunges cracking stephen in the jaw

      stephen goes down bloom leaps past him  but stephen grabs
      blooms leg and brings him down

      then they are fighting    penelope watches horrified

      a frightening brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart thirty years worth of a fight

      until stephen throws bloom to the ground at penelopes feet

      upsetting a small table the chinks pistol lying on the
      holey paper target falls and strikes the ground

      and goes off with a deafening rapport

      blood spreads just beneath stephens collarbone

      penelope screams

      stephen stays standing for a moment shocked a dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth he half grins

                          stephen
                tastes like tin foil

      and sinks to the ground

      blooms eyes glaze    he crawls to his brother   takes him in
      his arms

                             bloom
                im sorry

      penelope watches the brothers holding each other tears in
      her eyes but she backs away a step very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment

      bloom looks up at her almost taking a moment to recognize
      her

      in the middle of the broken room

      then bloom stands goes to the window and watches penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach

      from the darkened bedroom doorway steps the chink her face a

      sand

      opposite direction of penelope leaving stephen bleeding in

      a few lights flicker on the walls fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage

      bloom walks down the aisle trying to keep his voice steady

                           bloom
                stephen!

      a spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine right in blooms
      face he spins trapped in its glare

      a guttural command is shouted in what might be russian

      when bloom doesnt respond the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage

      bloom gingerly follows it up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop

      with a wary glance back bloom steps through it

      giant fossils of antique stage scenery utility lights high
      above cut by scaffolding patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black

                stephen games up come on out
                lets blow this one hat town

      silence then a harsh utility lamp snaps on cruelly
      lighting stephens face

      shockingly bruised and battered old and new blood

      bloom cries and rushes towards him




                                                                120

                   no!   no bloom freeze

      he obeys stephen is tied to a chair a dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand

                             bloom
                   stephen who is it   is it the dog

                   theyre calling to check right now
                   dont move im alright

      the dark figures cell phone rings he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed

      something happens in the blackness and stephen shakily
      stands cut loose

                             stephen contd
                   stay where you are bloom im
                   coming to you

      he takes a couple wobbly steps

      behind him bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards stephens back pulling the hammer

      and the utility lamp switches off

                              bloom
                   no!

      blooms revolver pops out of his sleeve and hes firing into
      the blackness

      stephen drops flat to the ground

      the fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness
      strobing the scene like stage lightning

      bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat but stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open

                              bloom contd

                              stephen
                 stay back!

      but bloom makes a dash for his brother out into the open
      unloading three more rounds into the dark

      the dark figure returns fire on bloom who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light a sitting duck

      stephen launches himself up tackling bloom backwards

      just before they fall behind the safety of the flat a red
      burst of blood flowers from stephens left lower back

      bloom sets him down gently and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him

      he turns firing but only sees a blur of dark coat go by
      through the torn backdrop

      bloom runs out on stage tearing the tarpaulin and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby

      silence

      bloom walks back to stephen who lies behind the flat
      breathing heavy blood soaking through his shirt

                           bloom
                 please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok tell me thats a squib and

      stephen coughs spits     then a wry grin spreads across his
      face

      bloom looks like he might hit him but his face breaks and he
      embraces him crying the brothers bloom stay like that for
      a long while holding each other in the spotlights glow

      finally stephen pulls away tears in his eyes   he wipes
      them wipes blood from his lip
