           that the little white lie i told to
           my thenbestfriend in the ladies
           room would come back to bite me on
           the ass however even i  who my
           fourth grade teacher stated on my
           report card has an imagination
           that should be quickly expunged 
           had no idea how quickly this
           article of fiction would spread
           so now we move on to part two the
           accelerated velocity of

           eighth grade olive

           school will make fun of you and

          quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet
                         
          olive sits in the closet for a moment contemplating what
          just happened wondering if he was telling the truth then
          she opens the door
                         
          the coast is clear except for another preteen kid walking
          past she aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the
          closet with her and promptly thrusts her tongue into his
          mouth

           if id known that meerkat todd was
           going to turn out so hot i
           probably would have cherished the
           moment more i suppose just that
           im sitting here reminiscing about
           it means that it must have meant
           something
           beat
           yeah so anyway  kissings not
           really my thing thats what i
           learned in natalie giblins closet

          scarlet letter
                         
           olive vo
           so im feeling like the cats ass
           because everyone thinks ive been
           deflowered im surprised at how
           empowered i felt by this
           prevarication i wonder to myself
           would i feel this invigorated if i
           had actually let some college kid
           violate me in his cockroach
           infested dorm room probably not
           beat
           ironically we were studying the
           scarlet letter but isnt that
           always the way with these teenage
           tales the literature you read in
           class always seems to have a strong
           connection with whatever angsty
           adolescent drama is being
           recounted i consider this
           pause
           then i think except for
           huckleberry finn i dont know
           any teenage boys who have ever run
           away with a big hulking black guy

                          nina
           why should i she brought it on
           herself
                         
          nina whips around and gives olive a look surprising her
                         
                          olive
           excuse me

           book that i personally deem
           wildly inappropriate for my age
           group so i felt that it was
           actually quite apropos
                         
                          rosemary
           more curious than angry
           what did you say
                         
          olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying
          the word out loud
                         
                          olive

                          brandon
          its true theres only one thing
          worse than these tabloidchasing
          celebutantes with their vapid minds
          and their immoral souls and thats
          the people who want to be like
          them
                         
                          olive
          did i say i wanted to be like them
                         
                          brandon
          no you just want everyone else to
          think you are
                         
                          olive
          why does it matter if its not who
          i really am no offense brando
          but maybe you could learn something
          from me
                         
                          brandon
          youre saying i should pretend to
          be straight so people will like
          me what a novel idea you should
          do seminars oh wait a minute i
          forgot in high school
          everybody pretends to be something
          theyre not!

                          olive
           calm down adolph theres a vein
           popping out of your neck im
           simply suggesting that maybe these
           kids we call peers have got the
           right idea maybe bridget
           schumacher isnt as hippydippy as
           she pretends to be maybe thats
           just the label shes put on herself
           to avoid having to bathe as often
           as society deems necessary or
           take marianne bryant its
           convenient for her to act like a
           stuckup jesusfreak
           thinking about this
           no im wrong i think shes
           actually just a stuckup jesus
           freak but do you think she cares
           that thats the way shes
           perceived no maybe she was just
           sick of being just another
           nameless faceless entity in a
           place and a time that reveres
           people for extremity
                         
          brandon realizes why shes chosen this path and feels for
          her
                         
                          brandon
           there are some of us though that
           want to just blend in to the crowd
                         
                          olive
           then maybe you need to go to that
           extreme or make the steadfast
           decision not to care even better
           if you can manage to do both

          olive have just retreated to

          brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down they giggle
          conspiratorially
                         
          olive plops down on the bed and stretches out brandon lays
          beside her she moans for the benefit of the audience she
          knows has assembled outside she moans again and its very
          convincing
                         
          she leans over and whispers in his ear

          int hallway  continuous
                         
          sure enough it seems as if most of the party is listening at
          the door  falling all over each other to hear nearest to
          the door is the bully who is pleasantly surprised by the
          noise inside

          olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of the
          scarlet letter and reads it while she makes sex noises
          brandon laughs at this and olive smacks him with it
          prompting him to stop she puts her finger over her lips
          giving him the shhhh sign
                         
          she continues to read as she thrusts her hips making the bed
          squeak ever so slightly
                         
                          brandon
                          whispering

                          olive
                          whispering
           depends do you wanna be a normal
           adolescent boy or do you wanna be a
           stud
                         
          he moans in his deepest voice she continues to read
          crescendoing her moaning like a pro

          she takes the top of the headboard and lightly taps it
          against the wall over and over
                         
                          olive contd
                          whispering
           now that i think about it we
           probably dont want to do this for
           too long itll give the
           impression that youre having
           difficulty finishing thats not
           the desired effect
                         
                          brandon
                          whispering
           are you sure youre a virgin
                         
                          olive

          brandon suppresses a laugh
                         
                         
          int guest room  moments later
                         
          olive is disheveling herself brandon musses up his hair
                         
                          olive
           hold on
                         
          she unbuttons brandons shirt and rebuttons it incorrectly

          he kisses her on the cheek and she smiles
                         
                         
          int hallway  continuous
                         
          the whole crowd leaning against the wall quickly disperses
          when the door opens
           49
                         
                         
          the bully immediately hands brandon a beer and throws his arm
          around him leading him drunkenly down the hallway with a
          crew of guys after the dirty details
                         
          olive looks at this and smiles satisfied then she realizes
          that though the guys have gone there are a whole slew of
          girls looking at her completely differently they avoid her
          eye contact as one would ward off medusa
                         
          olive finds melanie pretending not to be interested in her

          olive catches the reflection behind her of a group of guys
          leaning against the counter signalling no dont do it to
          him behind her back

           have come up with better signs no
           one even bothered to use
           alliteration or god forbid irony 
           not even a single acronym  and
           that seems a lot more unforgivable
           than my sins

           forgive me father for i have
           sinned i think thats how youre
           supposed to start these things
           im only going on what ive seen in
           the movies then i think im
           supposed to tell you how long its
           been since my last confession but
           thats kind of my first confession
           im not catholic i really dont
           know what im supposed to do
           except sit here in this booth and
           tell you what ive done wrong
           where do i even start
           beat
           ive been pretending to be a  how
           would one phrase it in catholic
           words a harlot its not like
           ive actually been doing the things
           that people are saying im doing
           but  then again  im not denying
           them so ive just been wondering
           is that wrong theres a lot of
           shi  crap going down at my
           school which may or may not be
           indirectly because of this
           masquerade
           beat
           im lying i may have caused the
           end of a marriage i thought in
           my own perverse way that i could
           help it i mean in my defense i
           am merely an adolescent i should
           never have been propositioned in
           the way i was propositioned by an
           adult but then again i should
           never have consented it was just
           that a lot of people had been
           asking me to do things and i
           thought it was okay because it
           wasnt real

           yknow medical science has not
           substantiated claims that any
           particular food increases sexual
           desire or performance its so
           funny when guys ply women with food
           that they think is gonna get them
           laid i mean whats really sexy
           about slurping back oysters you
           know native people believed that
           you gained the strength of the
           animal by consuming it some
           people grind up rhinoceros horn
           because its thought to stiffen the
           male sex organ its all bullshit
           and spanish fly its pulverized
           beetle that people eat! although
           its illegal for human consumption
           in the united states and do you
           know why because if you take just
           a bit too much it causes painful
           urination fever and bloody
           discharge

          they duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down
          but olive cant resist the urge to look up and see if
          rhiannon sees them
                         
          she does
                         
          olive and rhiannon make eye contact whereas olive looks
          remorseful rhiannon looks like shes just been stabbed in
          the back  which she has
                         
          the abernathys see her as well and wave its painfully
          obvious to olive that rhi hasnt told her parents about their
          differences she starts to go over but rhiannons face is
          turning vermillion in anger olive just waves sheepishly
          and leaves with anson

          doesnt want to externalize it
                         
          anson puts his hand on her knee

           i have something for you
                         
          olive manages a smile he reaches into his pocket and pulls
          out a $500 gift certificate to anthropologie and hands it to
          her

           its not your fault
                         
          olive gets a tear in her eyes she puts a red chip in at the
          top and loses the game she reaches over and presses the
          lever causing all of the chips to fall on his desk
                         
                          cut to

          full of his things

           mom!
                         
                          rosemary
           well! it was a different time
           103
                         
                         
                          olive
          ewwww!
                         
                          rosemary
          i did i got around before i met
          your father i was a garden variety
          floozy
                         
                          olive
          why are you telling me this
                         
                          rosemary
          because i endured a similar
          lynching because of a certain
          dalliance
                         
                          olive
          i promise that it was no worse than
          marianne bryants attack on me
                         
                          rosemary
          wanna bet it was her mother
                         
                          olive
          wait what
                         
                          rosemary
          yep don bryant and i got caught
          in a very compromising position in
          the locker room during a basketball
          game
                         
                          olive
          thats disgusting! hes
          disgusting!
                         
                          rosemary
          he wasnt back then he was
          actually pretty handsome all im
          saying is that maybe the reason
          that bryant girl is going after you
          is because her mother told her
          about me
                         
                          olive
          so the sins of the mother are
          revisited on the daughter
                         
                          rosemary
          theres something else you should
          know this is hard to say but 
          don bryant is your father
          marianne is your sister

           kidding!! well about the sister
           thing but not about the don thing
           that happened actually that
           happened a couple of times before
           we got caught

          hysterically

           wonderful and youre going to
           handle this the same way that i
           did with an incontrovertible
           sense of humor
                         
          they embrace and olive gets an idea
                         
                          olive

          rhiannon looks at her new best friends who just smile at
          her
                         
          the song ends and theres a drum roll
                         
                          rhiannon

          the drum roll ends and meerkat todd bounces out in costume
          he jumps around enthusing the student body 
                         
          but then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a
          dumpster
                         
          the familiar chords of the james bond theme nobody does it
          better plays from the band
                         
          meerkat todd opens the lid of the dumpster and olive dressed
          in a glittery and slinky red dress with a boa draped around
          her bare shoulder pops up and croons with a handheld mic and
          slightly different lyrics

          off  and shes quite good

          and howl at her sheer brilliance
                         
          she begins to rub her hands seductively over meerkat todds
          furry costume eventually unzipping it and taking off the

          a big red lip mark
