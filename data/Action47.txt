           david how exactly does this

           david hobbscap vo
           well brent all three of these
           street courses are classic round
           thehouse racetracks
                         
          outlines of three race courses are shown theyre labeled
          japan italy and england and are different in shape and
          size
                         
           david hobbscap vo
           this means that the lmp and formula
           cars should break out of the gate

           david hobbscap vo
           gt and touring cars like spains
           miguel camino should make up some
           ground but i doubt itll be enough
           to stop francesco from absolutely
           running away with it

           woah now just hold your
           horsepower youre forgetting the
           most important factor here that
           early dirt track section of the
           course! the dirt is supposed to be
           the great equalizer in this race
                         
          graphics of the courses now isolate a stretch after the first
          couple turns label it dirt sections

           darrell cartrip vo
           and dont forget lightning mcqueen!
           his mentor the hudson hornet was
           one of the greatest dirt track
           racers of all time in my opinion
           mcqueen is the best allaround
           racer in this competition

                          uncle topolino
           then why would you ask him to be
           someone else
                         
          mcqueen considers this  a realization
                         
                          mcqueen
           what did i do i said some things
           during our fight
                         
                          uncle topolino
           you know back when guido and luigi
           used to work for me they would
           fight over everything
                         
          in the square  guido dances with a girl luigi suddenly cuts
          in they begin to argue
                         
                          uncle topolino
           they fight over what ferrari was
           the best ferrari which one of
           them look more like a ferrari
           there were even some nonferrari
           fights
                         
          guido now lifts luigi cuts back in
                         
                          uncle topolino
           so i tell them va bene its okay
           to fight everybody fights now and
           then especially best friends
                         
          mcqueen takes this in seems to take some small comfort
                         
                          uncle topolino
           but you gotta make up fast

                          mater

           our investigation proved that
           allinol was actually gasoline and
           miles axlerod engineered it so that
           when it got hit by the beam it
           would explode
