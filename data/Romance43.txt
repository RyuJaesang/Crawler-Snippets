               on a black screen credits

               a raucous voice swimmers chanting in the cherokee language

               a range of mountains slowly emerges shrouded in a blue mist 
               like a chinese water color below them close to a small 
               town young men armed with vicious sticks and stripped to 
               the waist come charging in a muscular steaming pack

               their opponents also swinging sticks attach the pack

               a ball barely round made of leather emerges smacked 
               forwards by inman who hurtles after it and collides with a 
               stick swung by swimmer a young and lithe american indian 
               inman falls clutching his nose the ball bobbles on the 
               ground in front of him he grabs it and gets to his feet 
               the blood pouring from his nose

               his team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge

               a pristine cabriolet pulled by an impressive horse comes 
               down towards the town it has to pass across the temporary 
               field of play parting the teams some of the contestants 
               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the cabriolet and 
               its two exotic passengers passes by

               the driver is a man in his early fifties dressed in the 
               severe garb of a minister monroe and next to him a self
               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate architectural skirts 
               of the period is his daughter ada inman using his shirt 
               to staunch his battered nose looks at ada astonished by 
               her an angel in this wild place

               now swimmer stops chanting and begins more hesitantly to 
               translate into english

                         you will be lonely you will howl 
                         like a dog as you walk alone you 
                         will carry dog shit cupped in your 
                         hands you will be smeared with dog 
                         shit your spirit will wane and 
                         dwindle to blue the colour of 
                         despair 

               as the cabriolet passes swimmer takes the ball an with a 
               whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal the game 
               resumes ada looks back as the men swarm into each other

               the crouching man has wrapped fuze wire around the last 
               barrel and now retreats paying out the wire as he does so

               rourke is running but now the ground buckles under him and 
               hes being lifted slowly into the air the earth swelling

               an apocalyptic explosion four tons of dynamite rip the ground 
               open in a crater 135 feet long 90 feet across 30 feet deep

               horses guns men are blown to pieces and thrown up into the 
               air

               inman disappears under dirt and debris

               pandemonium the confederates are in complete disarray the 
               federals pour forwards across no mans land through the 
               peaceful oasis of trees roaring the roar of attack they 
               flood towards the crater hundreds of them charging into a 
               dense and impenetrable wall of smoke

               then theyre inside the great gash of crater and cant get 
               out again arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud

               the confederates regroup orders are yelled chaos developing 
               into battle

               the confederates begin firing into the crater guns and mortar 
               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death 
               trap

               inman gets to his feet oakley with him and rushes through 
               the smoke to the pit emptying his lemats into the crater

               later a black regiment from the union join the attack bodies 
               falling on bodies as the federals charge in and pack their 
               comrades even tighter the confederates make a pincer movement 
               outside the crater forcing all the federals in its 
               medieval

               no escape

               the confederates jump into the pit to engage the federals 
               hand to hand fighting too close for rifles just bayonets 
               and guns swung like clubs and inman sliding down into that 
               hell tiring the nine rounds then the shotgun charge which 
               does a terrible damage primitive unutterable carnage men 
               killing each other in embraces soldier crushed against 
               soldier desperate to survive to kill to live an oozing 
               layer cake of bodies dead and frantically alive drowning 
               in slick

               young oakley loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case 
               clubbing his opponent then slips onto him and is stuck with 
               a bayonet the pain of which makes him squeal

               inman goes at it hes a warrior punching and stabbing and 
               firing a coldly efficient killer hes grabbed from behind 
               and crushed a hand gouging at his face an almighty struggle

               he falls and lands on top of oakley and he and his federal 
               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their 
               pillow the slaughter continues over and around them the 
               sound the sound of hell and madness the boy has his arm 
               around inman like lovers

               later the confederates run after the retreating union 
               soldiers firing cavalry riding them down inman stands 
               the boys blood all over him exhausted and appalled the 
               crater behind him an abattoir of men the victors are

                         weve been there! kicked old nicks 
                         asshole

               a wounded black soldier sits up as butcher celebrates

               butcher runs over but cant find a charge for his musket 
               he looks around in the stack of corpses pulling out weapons

               tries one not loaded throws it down tries another not 
               loaded the wounded man cant get up tries to drag himself 
               like a crab away from butcher inman yells at him appalled

                                     butcher
                         you got a charge

               into allegiance wounded prisoners able to walk are led away

               personal items inman sees a soldier in the crater lining 
               up wounded federals putting their heads in a row the man 
               extracts a hammer from his belt and satisfied he has an 
               economic arrangement proceeds down the line smashing each

               the corpses mouth hes yanking away when a swinging boot 
               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground

               a beautiful night lots of stars inman and three others 
               including butcher slide over the top of the trench far to 
               one side of the stand of trees the plan is to cast a wide 
               arc that will bring them around back of the trees closer to 
               the enemy side than their own the four men slither over the 
               ground they pause inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses

               he slithers over them

               they work their way towards the trees there are a half dozen 
               federals crouching in the cover of the trees they are dozing 
               only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the confederate 
               lines the others have their backs to the enemy sitting 
               against the trunks grabbing a few minutes sleep

               as the four rebels approach still crawling one of the 
               federals opens his eyes sees the attack shifts for his 
               rifle inman immediately stands up firing instantly killing 
               him and two others while butcher throws himself at another

               the exchanges are brief and savage and one of inmans party 
               and all of the federals lay dead then the rebels break from 
               the trees

               a flare goes up then another both from the confederate 
               trenches inman and his accomplices are picked out in a 
               brilliant green light shots follow from both sides aimed 
               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own 
               lines as they get close voices cry out rippling down the 
               trench joining their own admonitions dont shoot hold 
               your fire theyre our boys hold your fire!!! theyre almost 
               home butcher is laughing whooping then just as suddenly 
               he falls wounded inman stops turns back runs to him

               inman collects butcher drags him carries him theyre fifty 
               yards from their lines a bullet catches inman in the neck

               he goes down like a tree blood pouring from his neck lying 
               on the ground he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly 
               fade to black all sound fading with them

               warily his beard longer his figure gaunt his clothes 
               weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal

               he hears dogs barking in the distance faint shouts he picks 
               up his pace skirts round the swampy lake

               ext cape fear river dusk

               inman comes to the bank of a huge river the water as the 
               light begins to go is the color of mud with bubbles 
               belching to the surface full of ugly prominent inman is 
               almost jogging now an ear tracking his still distant 
               pursuers the river is too wide to contemplate swimming and 
               now it begins to curve left forcing him  against his 
               judgment to circle back he approaches a small jetty

               a sign ferry $5 yell loud

               on the far bank theres a cabin on stilts above the highwater 
               mark inman calls out reluctantly his voice still a kind 
               of growl then again

               a tiny figure steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping 
               into a small canoe the canoe heads against the current the 
               rowers back bent with the effort as the canoe approaches 
               inman sees that the ferryman is in fact a young girl not 
               eighteen she doesnt look at him he produces five dollars

               suddenly slumps back and falls into the water

               veasey grabs out at the oar but it goes too the girl sinks 
               quickly a bloody gap to the side of her head inman on his 
               knees and stretching cant help her then a second noise as 
               a hole the size of a fist appears in the canoe just at 
               waterlevel water pours into the canoe dogs bark and now 
               figures are visible at the jetty home guard one of them 
               has a snipers rifle and is loading for a third shot inman 
               can see him sighting the rifle they lie flat in the canoe

               another great fist of wood is gouged out now the boat is 
               almost full of water veasey spits out a foul mouthful inman 
               rocks the canoe and lets it turn over onto them veasey 
               surfaces from under it clutching the wood as a raft but 
               the canoe catches inman a blow to his head and he sinks 
               veasey hauls him to the surface and surprisingly strong 
               holds him with one fist the boat with the other lets the 
               current take them pulling them under then up under then 
               up but clinging on as the rifle continues to deliver its 
               assault another shot into the boat another into the water 
               near to veaseys arm

               the girls body comes by them carried by the river the 
               dress billowing out almost covering her head the sun has 
               gone the light fading the canoe sliding downriver away 
               from their aggressors

               ext another part of the cape fear night

               in the moonlight the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and 
               veasey drags a halfdrowned inman to land both of them 
               retching with the vile river water an alligator eases into 
               the river not ten feet from where they lie lungs heaving 
               they get up veasey to his feet inman to his knees

                                     veasey
                         you okay

               rebecca reluctant rejoins the other slaves walks away 
               with them but then turns back to look at veasey she clearly 
               cares about him and seeing her has somehow broken his heart

               he turns away from inman towards sheffield

                                     veasey
                         im with you i got a baby coming

               ext railroad track day

               the chain gang trudges down the track horses on either side 
               of them steep banks forming a v for the railroad a train 
               is coming brown rides up to the prisoners herds them off 
               the track the train approaches quite slowly  the boxcars 
               full of wounded soldiers some of the home guard dismount 
               take out pipes the prisoners wait one of them sits down

               sheffield says something to veasey who casually yanks up 
               the sitting prisoner inman suddenly understands whats going 
               to happen the train is almost on them

                                     inman
                         no!

               but its too late sheffield jerks forward in front of the 
               train pulling all the others with him their reluctance 
               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming 
               train

               somehow the chain gang gets across the track stumbling and 
               chaotic the chains yanking tight then loose the tight 
               causing a collapse the loose a recovery

               they run alongside the train blocking themselves from the 
               fire of the guard sheffield screaming tactics  and then 
               as the train starts to pull past them they run up the bank 
               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit

               on the other side of the train the home guard have remounted 
               their horses and are riding hard alongside it then they 
               have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top 
               of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along 
               the ridge sheffields yelling with adrenaline veasey joins 
               in elated one of the guards raises a rifle steadies himself 
               on his horse fires he catches veasey who crumples spinning 
               round and falling down the bank until inman uses all his 
               strength and practically lifts him in the air the chain 
               recovers and works back up the bank

               but then a second bullet catches another prisoner and this 
               time the effect is catastrophic  the whole gang just flips 
               over and plummets down the bank the home guard approach 
               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch 
               by the side of the track until all movement ceases inman 
               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely almost 
               completely covering his face brown arrives considers the 
               carnage

               the sound of tiny bells a misty drizzle a goat snuffles 
               around in the freshly turned dirt a hand pale and wet 
               protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies 
               of the murdered chain gang

               wedged under three or four corpses  their limbs and chains

               spitting out dirt he makes a noise to distract the goat 
               rattling the chains inman rears up the bodies slithering 
               off him but even then the animal only retreats a yard or

                         abide a chicken but a goat gives 
                         you company and milk and cheese and 
                         then when you need it good meat

               in a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has slit 
               the throat of the goat putting the bowl underneath its neck 
               to catch the blood still stroking the goat which blinks as 
               if it were only surprised and not dying

                         feet against the feet of my enemy 
                         and i always killed him and he never 
                         killed me

               in his entourage but theyre all dead a spare horse has 
               three corpses hung over it another horse drags a makeshift 
               litter with a couple more souvenirs of their cave visit 
               teague waves

                                     teague

                         put down
                              they approach
                         good directions to that cave from 
                         the fat boy  saw the squirrels 
                         sat on the tree made some friends 
                         brought some back with me

               his riders begin quite casually to fan out

               in one movement inman slaps the flank of the horse which 
               careers down the track then turns and fires twice before 
               pitching himself into a roll towards the trees his first 
               shot knocks jo from his horse the second mo who falls into 
               the snow bleeding from the groin and screaming the riderless 
               horse gets tangled up with the others

               inman is in the trees shots around him he doesnt move 
               away from but towards the riders inside the line of trees 
               grayling charges him riding into the trees inman shoots 
               him then rushes from the trees firing missing bosie who 
               rides away evidently not relishing the fight and throws 
               himself at teague whose horse is bucking wildly teagues 
               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air inman yanks 
               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the 
               shotgun barrel of the lemats with the other the big pistol 
               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil teagues chest 
               opens out as hes thrown off the horse mo is still screaming

               inman walks over and shoots him in the head then walks to 
               teague who is saying something the blood blotting the snow 
               under him

               inman studies him picks up the spencer carbine turns to 
               look where bosie has gone steps up onto teagues horse 
               reins the horse in and trots it over to the prostrate teague 
               leans over and shoots him dead he turns the horse in the 
               direction bosie had headed he cant see horse or rider but 
               in the stand of hickory trees ahead the gusts of steaming 
               breath betray them both he rides slowly towards the stand 
               of trees

               ext cold mountain day

               ada and ruby walking they hear the shots ada turns and 
               starts to run through the snow her hat flying from her head

               ext stand of hickory trees cold mountain day

               inmans horse is parallel to bosie who is deep inside the 
               trees but also riding slowly its like a dance

               and in that second he produces his gun and fires inman has 
               already fired the lemats and the boy shot in the head falls 
               caught by one stirrup the horse bolting inman watches stock 
               still then makes a cough as if clearing his throat and a 
               thin mist of blood sprays from his mouth

               ext ridge cold mountain day

               ada and ruby running they reach stobrod his horse stopped 
               drinking from the creek stobrod barely conscious hanging 
               halfway down its flank held on by the ropes

               ada hurries on taking the shotgun from ruby who tends to 
               her father

               ext a grove of trees cold mountain day

               ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses she hardly 
               stops to look at the bodies just rushes on

               the ground simplifies and shes at the bottom of a grove a 
               steep incline the sun low and in front of her she sees a 
               brilliant frame of black trees and then a sudden flurry of 
               angry crows flying towards her at the top of the hill is a 
               small hieroglyph of a man

               finally the image from the swanger well exactly as she first 
               saw it

               the figure raises a hand briefly then pitches forward into 
               the snow

               she runs her heart broken towards the body of inman hes 
               dead the red flag of his life ebbed away in the snow ada 
               falls to her knees and pulls him over the snow crusted on 
               his face which she wipes away with great tenderness then 
               sits his head in her lap as ruby slowly comes up the hill 
               towards them

               a violin plays quite raucous
