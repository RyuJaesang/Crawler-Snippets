time the word rings in connerss head     he starts to put it
together

                    conners
          precisely he knows police protocol
          not to mention the shit in our own
          precinct hes disguising his voice
          means hes got a record and has done
          this before hes heavily armed and
          wellconnected he knows hes
          surrounded he hasnt asked for a
          damned thing he drops that hint about
          sunrise prepping us for a long wait
          hes buying time why

                    vincent
              brainstorming
          to figure out his next move    he wasnt
          expecting us

                    dekker
          no he wasnt expecting you he said
          he thought you were still suspended

                    conners
          probably thought it would take the
          whole day for you to find me giving
          him the time he needs

                    teddy
          hes stalling

              interrupting
          the hostages are in imminent danger
          theyve confessed to killing someone an
          automatic murder one charge  thats a
          life sentence maybe a needle for all of
          them so why keep witnesses around to
          testify longer we wait the greater the
          risk we need to go in now

          edward lorenz invented the chaos theory
          in the 1960s its the study of
          phenomena that appear random but in

          which can be described mathematically
