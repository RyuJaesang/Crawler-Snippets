                    it is so you see i dont know where
                    ricky verona is because if i knew where
                    he is i would probably be there right

          tosses it into the sink hes visibly fading
          
          orlando takes a quick look over the wad pulls a little
          plastic bag out of his vest pocket tosses it to chev the
          bag hits chev square in the forehead hits sweat and sticks
          chev reaches for it lamely  it slides off and lands on the
          floor his reflexes are not the best at this point
          
          chev collapses to his knees breaks it open and snorts it
          right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees the
          brothers find this hilarious

               the glass window where the pharmacist is talking to someone
               on the telephone looking out at him suspiciously

               chev wanders through the trauma ward trying to look
               inconspicuous avoiding eye contact knocking things over
               trying doors inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray
               tossing the empty bottles eyes watering

               at the ceiling  chev cant tell if hes asleep or awake he
               watches the old man for a stolen moment hypnotized

                    right
          
          chev nods weakly the resident on his hands and knees
          starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the
          floor the cops sensing weakness start to tense chev
          snaps out of it momentarily
          
                              chev
                    dont even think about it!
          
          the resident approaches him cautiously on his knees holding
          out a handful of small white boxes
          
                              chev contd
                    give me that
          
          he snatches them cradling them against his stomach and
          backs up past the docs toward the elevator just as the chime
          sounds and the doors slide open he tosses the boxes inside
          the fat man lets out another agonized groan
          
                               at man
                     asshole
          
          chev points the gun at him
          
                              chev
                    not going to tell you again
          
          he grabs a defibrillator paddle out of tech 2s trembling
          hands and holds it to his chest

               the resident flips a switch on the crash cart and the thing
               begins to charge  chev holds the paddle to his chest with
               one hand the gun out with the other  finally 
          
               zappp!!!! chev flies backwards bouncing off the wall like a
               pinball the cops leap forward trying to take advantage
               but chev pops back up wired and wild eyed

               he fires another warning shot into the ceiling and leaps into
               the elevator as the doors close behind him

               chev collapses on the floor of the elevator he fumbles with
               the white boxes the resident handed him and comes up with a
                                    c

                         ok  needles hate needles 
          
               he rubs his arm feeling for a nice vein squirts a few drops
               from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in 
               pushes the plunger all the way plucks it out and tosses it
               in the corner
          
               chev sits patiently against the wall staring blankly
               straight ahead suddenly a curious look comes over him

                on hood #1 and is about to set off a shooting gallery when

                chev affords himself about a second and a half of bugeyed
                shock before snapping out of it and dropping hood #1
                instantly with a shot to the head
          
                 haos breaks out as the others dive for cover and start
                blasting chev yanks kaylos chair up and shoves it toward
                the hoods  then makes a break for the elevator shaft
                grabbing eve as he goes
          
                 aylos body screens chev and eve as they run taking hits
                finally toppling over again chev takes out another hood on
                the run nailing him right between the eyes
          
                 hev turns his back on the hoods covering eve as they make
                a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a bullet in the
                ass
          
                                    chev

                he spins and empties his clip at the hoods who hit the deck
          
                eve holds his ass as chev looks down the open elevator shaft
                the elevator is half a floor down moving slow he grabs

                chev and eve hit the floor of the moving elevator with a
                crash and roll out onto the 4th floor the workers are all
                in a panic standing by their sewing machines  theyve
                obviously heard the shots the supervisor is walking around
                shoving them back into their seats screaming at everyone in
                korean to keep working

                the supervisor all of five feet walks right up to chev and
                eve and starts screaming at them in broken english
          
                                         supervisor

                the door on the far end of the room busts open and hoods pour
                in from the stairwell they spot him
          
                chev and eve duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of
                machines toward the windows the hoods fan out they play
                cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and koreans
                while the supervisor oblivious continues screaming and
                forcing the workers back into their chairs
          
                chev puts a finger to eves lips calming her momentarily
          
                 then comes up behind a youngish hood and shoves the
                hoods gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at
                least fifty years old operated by a korean woman even older
                the rusty thing punctures his hand over and over as he
                screams jumping up and down unable to get free
          
                 hev grabs the gun they make for the fire escape

                they reach the bottom of the ladder and are pinned down by
                gunfire from above
          
                chev gives her a look that says it all

                chev notices the purse still over his shoulder takes it off
                and hands it to her with a quick upward glance he breaks
                cover and squeezes off 4 shots nailing two hoods on the fire

          eve is pale as a sheet she steps over the body like she was
          avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit chev grabs
          her hand and yanks her along
          
          he spots eves car parked backwards across the street and
          they make a desperate run for it as more shots whiz and
          ricochet off the pavement
          
          eve is rifling through her purse as they run naturally chev
          assumes shes looking for the car keys

          chev answers the gunfire with shots of his own buying them a
          few seconds then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out
          onto the ground

          she looks like shes about to wander around gathering up her
          things when another volley of shots blows out the passenger
          window of the car
          
          chev picks eve up like a sack of grain and throws her head
          first through the passenger window into the car then runs
          around the other side hops in and peels out
