	1  primeval swamp  early dawn

	it is very early in the dawn  blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp a mist clings to the 
	trees this could be the jungle of a million years ago

	our view moves closer through the mist tilting down to 
	the tepid water a small bubble rises to the surface
	then another suddenly but quietly a form begins to 
	emerge a helmet water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud printed on a helmet 
	in a psychedelic  hand are the words gook killer 
	the head emerges revealing that the toughlooking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard he has no 
	shirt on only bandoliers of ammunition  his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern he looks to the 
	right he looks to the left he looks into camera and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp disapperaring completely

	our view holds we begin to hear natural though 
	unrecognizable jungle sounds far off in the distance
	we pan to reveal a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp and part of what seems to be a falstaff beer can
	in the mud a hand reaches out and the beer can disappears
	as we tilt up we notice that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a m60 machine gun hand painted
	in a paisley design

	now the view moves away across the ancient growth past
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes
	across to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever tightening view
	their feet boots and sandals leave no impression make
	no sound a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path waiting and watching

	the view pushes along with the vietnamese moving faster
	and faster with them until suddenly directly in front
	about ten feet away an enormous american clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side steps in front of them he smiles
	laconically and blasts out five shots that rip through
	us by the second shot the whole jungle blazes out 
	with automatic fire

	out view turns as the men around us are thrown and torn
	screaming and scattering into the jungle more americans
	appear unexplainably out of the growth it is now that
	we fully see the bizarre manner in which they are dressed
	some wear helmets others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals some of them have long
	savagelooking hair other crewcut or completely shaved
	they wear bandoliers flak jackets shorts and little else
	they wear montagnard sandals or no shoes at all and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns
	they appear one with the jungle and mist firing into us
	as they move

	the soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp dripping
	mud his machine gun blasting fire

	we begin to move quickly with one vietnamese breathlessly
	running for his life we move into the jungle with him
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling american
	painted and wearing feathers like an indian our view
	falls with him to the ground staring upwards as flame
	and exploding mud scatter above us men scream and die
	around us the screams amid the gunfire and explosions
	are piercing and terrible as though the jungle itself is
	frightened

	an american wearing a jungle hat with a large peace sign
	on it wearing war paint bends toward us reaching down
	toward us with a large knife preparing to scalp the
	dead

	our view moves away along with the running sandals of a
	vietnamese soldier moving faster and faster only to be
	stopped by still another of the savagelooking americans
	with primitive ornamentation wearing only a loincloth
	and green beret he opens his flamethrower directly on us
	and the nva soldier and we are incinerated in flame
	bright psychedelic orangered flame outrageous loud
	electric rock music overwhelms the soundtrack 


		main title  apocalypse now


	2  title sequence

	the credit titles proceed as the flane consume us 
	growing more intense brighter more vivid purifying
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at like the sun itself

	then it explodes breking apart and shattering once
	again it begins to cool as the titles continue it
	is as though we are moving through the white center of
	cooling flame forming a spinning web and becoming more
	distant the titles continue

	we are moving toward planetary nebulae moving through the
	stars moving closer to the earth we can barely hear the
	music  now

	we move closer to the earth beautiful covered in clouds
	as though seen from a satellite the titles continue

	we are moving closer to the earth through the soft clouds
	close enough that we can make out the western hemisphere
	closer to north america closer to america then california
	los angeles still closer to the odd fingerlike
	shapes of 


	3  ext marina del rey

	the view finally settles on a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day

	it is large pleasure boat the people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes they are drinking
	cocktails and snapping pictures the boat belongs to the
	head of a large american corporation and this is his
	party this man charlie is sitting his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint charlie is going on and on 

				charlie
		 its crazy  sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton  sugar !

				lawyer
		what about oil 

				charlie

		i didnt build a twobilliondollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing we can protect
		our interests
			pause for a drink
		we are still the most powerful
		nation in the world militarily

	he leans to his associates in a halfwhisper

				charlie
			continuing
		you know bodyguard he was a
		captain in viet nam you talk to
		him except he wont talk this
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky a nice quiet fella though

	the view begins to pull away from this group

				charlie
			continuing
		carries a attache case at all
		times you know whats in it 
			another sip
		an ingram machine pistol

	gradually charlies voice softens as we move away and a
	new voice the voice of someone thinking comes in over it 

		charlie					willard vo
	i dont tahe chances and			bullshit you can kill
	neither should this country			with the ridge of your
	if were strong we should			hand to the throat you
	protect our interests and			can crush a skull with
	we should have the respect			your knee but you
	of the world even if it				cant kill anybody with
	takes another war				your pinky

	the view move along the guests of this small party 
	pictures being taken some people are swimming it is the
	good life now willards voice track dominates

				willard vo
		the attache case has been empty
		for three years but it makes him
		safe to think theres a machine
		pistol in it

		i dont like automatic weapons
		they jam

		i saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		m16 to automatic and it jammed
		how much money did the contractors
		make on the m16 

	our view is moving through the people on the boat some
	reading flirting drinking

				willard vo
			continuing
		he likes to hear stories about nam
		i tell him i cant theyre not
		cleared the truth is he wouldnt
		understand

	we can now see a man with his back to us looking the
	opposite way an attache case resting near to him we 
	move closer

				willard vo
			continuing
		theres no way i can tell them
		what really happened over there

		i wouldntve believed it if
		someoned told me

	we are now resting on his back occasionally he sips
	from a beer but we cannot see his face

				willard vo
			continuing
		there was only one part that
		mattered  for me anyway i
		dont even know if i remember
		all of it i cant remember
		how it ended exactly  because
		when it ended i was insane

	willard looks at the civilian a moment and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word
	the civilian follows


	8  ext helicopter  dusk

	a darkly painted huey roars over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain it crosses a barbed
	wire and sandbagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified concealed compound

				willard vo
		they took me to some place outside
		nha trang intelligence headquarters
		for all operations in south east asia
		id worked for intelligence before 

	armed men jump from the huey  among them willard a
	large camouflaged cover is moved revealing an underground
	corridor  they enter


	9  full shot  underground plotting room

	a door swings wide  willard steps through and comes to
	attention blocking the view of the room a strange
	reddish light pervades the room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke

	the whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cutback jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it

				willard
		captain bl willard g4 headquarters
		reporting as ordered sir

				colonel os
		okay willard sit down

	willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor across from him around steel desks
	and tables sit several men the nearest one a colonel
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe  behind
	him sits a major and a seedylooking civilian

				colonel
		have you ever seen this officer
		before captain willard 

	he points to the major

				willard
		no sir

				colonel
		this gentleman or myself 

				willard
		no sir

				colonel
		i believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in kontum
		is that right 

				willard
		i am not presently disposed to
		discuss that sir

				major
		very good

	he turns to the colonel and nods his approval the
	colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map

				colonel
		you know much about about special forces
		green berets captain 

				willard
		ive worked with them on occasions
		and i saw the movie  sir

	the officer smiles at this

				colonel
		then you can appreciate commands
		concern over their  shall we say
		erratic methods of operation
			pause
		i have never favored elite units
		captain including your paratroopers
		or whatever just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesnt give him any
		priviliges in my book  not in
		this mans army

				major
		we didnt need em in korea 
		no sir give me an ohio farm boy
		and an m1 garand none of this
		fancy crap  no sir

				civilian
			stopping him
		major

				colonel
		we have special forces a
		detachments all along the
		cambodian border two here and
		another one here  twelve or
		fourteen americans  pretty
		much on their own they train
		and motivate montagnard natives
		pick their own operations if
		they need something they call 
		for it and get it within
		reason what were concerned
		with is here


	10  close view  on the map

				colonel
		the a detachment at nu mung ba
		it was originally a larger base
		built up along the river in an
		old cambodian fortress
	
		the area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years 
		but 


	11  med view

				colonel
		 captain we know somethings
		going on up there  major 

	the major looks at some papers in front of him

				major
		communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of vc activity
		this is routine expected  but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped

				colonel
		about the same time  large numbers
		of montagnards of the mnong descent
		began leaving the area  this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the rhade
		tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries but what is unusual is
		that we began to find rhade refugees
		too  in the same sampans as the
		mnongs these people arent afraid
		of vc theyve put up with war
		for twenty years  but something
		is driving them out

				major
		we communicate with the base
		infrequently what they call for
		are air strikes immediate 
		always at night and we dont
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on

				willard
		who 

				major
		you see no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive

				willard
		why me 

				major
		walter kurtz lieutenant colonel
		special forces we understand
		you knew him

	he puts kurtz dossier in willards hand

				willard
		yeah

				colonel
		hes commanding the detachment
		at nu mung ba

	the colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder
	flicks it on the recording is first static  the
	air controller then asks for more information on target
	coordinates  it all sounds very routine military
	then a frantic voice comes on talking slurred like
	someone dumb except very fast

				voice on tape
		up 2  0  give it to me quick 
		mark flare  affirmative damn 
		immediate receive  hearing
		automatic weapons fire man 

	gunfire is heard and a lower slower voice in background

				second voice
		blue delta five
		this big rhine  three
		need that ordinance immediately
		goddamn give it to me immediate
		christ  big rhino 
		blue god  delta damn  goddamn

	a heavy burst of automatic weapons fire  insane laughter
	 static and faintly very faintly we hear hard rock
	music  more static  suddenly a low clear voice
	peaceful and serene almost tasting the words

				third voice
		this is big rhino six  blue delta

				major
		thats colonel kurtz

				kurtz vo
		i want that napalm dropped in the
		trees  spread it among the
		branches

		well give you a flare  an
		orange one  bright orange
			static
		wed also like some white phosporous
		blue delta white phosporous give
		it to me

	static interrupts  the major turns the machine off

				willard
		i only met kurtz once

				civilian
		would he remember you 

				willard
		maybe

				colonel
		what was your impression of him 

	willard shrugs

				civilian
		you didnt like him

				willard
		anyone got a cigarette

	the major offers him one they wait as he lights up thinks

				willard
			continuing
		i thought he was a lame

				colonel
		a lame 

				willard
		this is years ago before he
		joined special forces i guess
		we had an argument

				colonel
		about what 

				willard
		i dont know he was a lame
		thats all

				colonel
		but why 

				willard
		he couldnt get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words about why we kill

				colonel
		well hes killing now

				willard
		maybe

				civilian
		what does that mean 

				willard
		maybe its not kurtz i dont
		believe hes capable of that
		i just dont believe it

				colonel
		its got to be kurtz

				civilian
		the point is that kurtz or
		somebody attacked a south
		vietnamese ranger platoon three
		days ago last week a recon
		helicopter was lost in the area 
		another took heavy damage 
		direct fire from their base
		camp

				willard
		our recon flight 

				civilian
		ours

				willard
		touchy

				civilian
		you can see of course the
		implications if any of this 
		even rumours leaked out

				willard
		you want me to clean it up 
		simple and quiet

				civilian
		exactly  youll go up the
		nung river in a navy pbr 
		appear at nu mung ba as if by
		accident reestablish your
		acquintance with colonel kurtz
		find out whats happened  and
		why then terminate his command

				willard
		terminate 

				civilian
		terminate with extreme prejudice

	18  close shot  on willard

	suddenly his attention is diverted  there is a slow
	buffeting as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly the boat shakes slightly there
	is a distant rolling noise like interrupted thunder all
	the men have stopped whatever theyre doing  stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond the buffeting and noise continues  they all
	stand silently  suddenly it stops

				willard

				willard vo
		the dossier on a detachment had
		letters from kurtz wife and the
		wives and families of his men
		all asking where to send future
		mail understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work  none of the men had
		written home in half a year

	occasionally in the bg we feel the terrifying buffeting
	of the distant b52 bombing


	21  close  on willard

	studying examining a report


	22  montage  pictures of kurtz

	kurtz face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier
	as willard reads 

				willard vo
		lieutenant kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and welldisciplined
		spirit he is a fine officer
		combining military efficiency 
		with a broad background in the
		humanities the arts and sciences 

	another picture of kurtz in germany standing next to the
	161st petroleum supply group sign

				willard vo
			continuing
		 he views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker less
		fortunate areas in the world

	a shot of kurtz at jump school

				willard vo
			continuing
		 i feel captain kurtz request
		for special forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns and
		his somewhat liberal politics
		though i can see no reason to
		deny it

	a close shot of kurtz with green beret on in the vietnam
	jungle his face is blank and vacant

				willard vo
			continuing
		 we feel major kurtz need to
		bring a sense of western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our vietnamization
		programs 

	move in to kurtz empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a blurred mass of dots

	in the bg we begin to hear a swell of two thousand
	male voices the engines of four helicopters approaching
	all heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment
	on the nose amd doors of the black huey are painted large
	playboy rabbits finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men the door of the
	copter slides partially open  two young green berets
	step out with m16s to varied catcalls when this
	abates a young extremelly welldressed man emerges he
	is the epitome of a hollywood agent hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff  clothes are formal
	but hip  shoes are shined  quite some dude  his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man

	he walks over to the microphone

				agent
		id like to say hello from all of
		us up here to all of you out there
		all of you whove worked so hard
		during operation brute force 
		paratroopers  infantry  airmen
		 medics  marines  and sailors
		and i want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is to prove it  weve brought
		some entertainment we think youre
		gonna like the playmate of the year
		and her two runners up !

	he pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed gogo outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the creedence clearwater revival singing
	suzy q


	30  montage on the girls and men

	various shots as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner  smiling

	the faces of the gis pass  their jaws drop  some
	look almost horrified chef is hypnotized  mr clean
	cries chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness

	others grab the air in front of them with each movement
	their need increases by the square


	31  full shot  pedestal  girls  men

	they crush forward starting to scream  men fall on the
	wire  the guards in the riot control positions forget
	 the attack dogs are trampled the mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire men scream and fall into the moat
	which is filling up fast the agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before he casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade the girls retreat into the copter  he follows
	then the two green berets the rotars whine  the black
	playboy huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it they grab frantically for the wheels but miss the
	huey wheels up into the blue sky leaving them all below

	such are the ways of war

	strong looking man emerges he wears a wellcut and
	neatlystretched tiger suit it is colonel william kilgore
	 tough looking welltanned with a black mustache

	he crouches over holding his hat in the rotor wash it
	is no ordinary hat but a la dodgers baseball hat he
	walks out and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle

				clean

		food theyll be throwing it away
		halfeaten if the branches arent
		broken their weapons are slung

	195  pov boat  full shot  jungle

	the canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun the forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes  a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb the depth of the
	jungle is dark ominous  yet cool and strangely inviting


	196  full shot  boat  jungle

	suddenly the river widens the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat it is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a b52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it oxi
	dizing in the sun creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights  the jungle is claiming it but
	once under its shadow they have passed a gateway a
	gateway to paradise

	the river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive the hills beyond are purple and lush strange
	orange colored waterfowl swim lazily out of their way
	the water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom the sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians it is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well
	being

	each man in his heart feels a need to stay  his soul
	cries to stop  stop their madness  this spiral into
	hell

	here is all that can be had of earth but no hand moves
	the boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing a hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats the boat follows the river into this
	hole

	but chief seems out of control  he lets the clip of his
	m16 go then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands
	and falls to willards feet a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs willard looks down in
	horror


	210  view on chief

	laying at willards feet  the long spear through him
	bleeding onto willards boots he looks up at willard
	about to say something

		a spear

	he dies

	the men are still crazily firing into the empty jungle
	long after those who attacked beat their retreat

				willard
		stop it stop it !

	slowly he pulls his boots from under chief they are
	absolutely soaked in blood he is stunned  sits down
	and begins to unlace the bloody boots and take them off

				lance
		chiefs dead

	willard unlaces the other boot and holds the bloody boot
	in his hand

				willard vo
		it was the strangest thing 
		i dont know that i can explain
		it two of my men dead and all
		i could think of was whether
		kurtz was dead too thats all
		i wanted to see kurtz to hear
		kurtz

	he starts to wipe the blood off the boot

		a great man
		somehow he was the only light
		in this hopeless hopeless

		and now i was too late 
		he was probably gone disappeared
		by a grenade rolled into his

	213  ext the river  pbr day

	the pbr moving up the river the men are practically
	in a trance now looking at the banks of the river they
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons


	214  what they see

	hundreds and hundreds of montagnard natives  dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner feathers parts
	of birds and animals codpieces  all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature but there is a purity
	about them men and boys standing passively watching
	the small navy craft flying the strange flag of red
	white and blue


	215  view on the pbr

	the men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage their manner is lifeless as though in a trance
	the various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them the chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers lances face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun he
	wears certain animal skins trinkets some animal teeth
	their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey they start to move to their gun
	positions

				willard
		just stand here with me where
		they can see us do nothing


	216  view from behind the pbr

	moving slowly toward the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint standing on canoes across the river the
	men on the crew stand in a group their hands visibly
	without weapons the natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach they accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi
	tability the boat moves closer approaches the wall of
	feathers  which slowly and automatically gives away in
	almost a ritual of birth undulating allowing the little
	boat to penetrate


	217  view on willard

	mus on his face to protect it from the sun the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself his intuition
	was right he senses that they would be allowed to pass


	218  full view on the river

	hundreds of montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run absolutely silently along the banks keeping
	pace with the pbr there is no hostility in these
	faces only curiosity and a sort of grief


	219  view on willard the crew

	they look up toward the bank


	220  their pov

	the temple at nu mung ba a fortified encampment built
	around the ruins of a former cambodian civilization
	stone walls barbed wire cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of escherlike sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress


	221  view on willard

	he picks up his field glasses and looks through


	222  willards pov  through glasses

	a sign entangled in the barbed wire  its lettering
	strict and military

				fourth special forces
				mission f82
				nu mung ba

	the glasses pov moves revealing another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand

				our motto apocalypse now !

	the pov of the glasses move once again and come upon an
	astonished sight a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics feathers and an australian bush hat
	he looks something like a multicolored harlequin waving
	frantically to the pbr the pov of the glasses move
	off of him


	223  view on willard

	not believing what hes just seen


	224  the glasses pov

	once again the young black man is now waving his

		all right

	willard look at chef who is at the helm he shrugs and
	they do as this man says the pbr moves towards the
	waters edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire the odd australian stands waving his hat guiding
	them safely in

	a thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses  half sub
	merged in the water other piles of bodies lie about some
	of them on fire fire literally burns from out of the
	ground chef nods at the bodies

				chef

	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress


	226  willards pov  through the field glasses

	men in small groups huddled over food
	now he settles on the entrance in the temple there
	are stakes in front and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads


	227  back to scene

				willard

				moonby
		no colonel kurtz couldnt be

	moonby nods and shrugs and hops off the pbr willard
	and the men follow


	228  moving view  willard moonby and the crew

	as they proceed closer to the fortresstemple men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle

	they are mostly montagnards but far more savage looking
	than any weve seen before they wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns they carry army m16s russian
	ak47s and a wide variety of knives and clubs women
	emerge from the brush as well they are armed and
	equally primitive looking interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins with the remnants
	of army insignia on them the paint on their bodies is
	if anything more bizarre we continue to move across
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of captain cook

	they encounter in the center of the group what once
	appears to have been an american he is tall gaunt
	wears a flak jacket but is otherwise naked save a
	loincloth his face is darkened from dirt battle smoke
	strange camouflage patterns his hair and beard are
	long matted with mud and grease he carries an ak47
	decorated with scalps and human ears willard approaches
	this beast who seems shy and retiring

				willard
		who are you

				moonby
			breaking in
		his name is

				willard
		im not ever goin to tell you
		to shut up again

	moonby shuts up the man tries to speak but nothing
	comes out he is dumbstrucked at seeing them as they
	are to see him

	229  reverse on colby

	looks at willard not understanding


	230  reverse on willard

	six months later and he and colby would be identical

	moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand

				moonby
		oh no don´t say that

				colby
		take us back take us back !
		but the operation  the team
		colonel kurtz has such plans for
		 the team

				willard
		take me to him major

	colby starts and then seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles he turns agitated to willard

				colby
		i had nothing to do with these
		operations  i did not do the
		planning  none of us did
		it was all colonel kurtz  he
		was the genius youll see 
		the genius of our colonel he
		should be made a general dont
		you think a general its

	suddenly frightened he stops without looking willard
	knows that kurtz is standing behind him he turns

	kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters he is
	a powerful man though obviously very ill he slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together
	though it is ripped and bloodied and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief as
	well as his usa colonels insignia he is feverish
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features his eyes
	almost hypnotize his midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound


	232  view on willard

	this is not what he expected he is quiet and then
	automatically he comes to an attention

				willard
		colonel kurtz i guess

				kurtz
		im kurtz

				willard
			he salutes
		captain bl willard reporting
		his presence sir


	233  view on kurtz

	looking at him a long time then he returns the salute
	and simply

				kurtz
		at ease
			pause as he regards him
		sit down


	234  med view

	there is of course no chair or anything like a chair
	but behind and around him kurtzs men begin to sit on
	the ground crosslegged finally willard sits as well
	then kurtz does

	moonby lights a joint and passes it respectfully to
	kurtz  throughout the scene the joint is passed from
	man to man ritualistically

				kurtz
			slowly
		why did you come to  my province

				willard
		we were attacked  down river
		we need supplies and medical 
		help

				kurtz
		you were not coming here to
		see me

				willard
			finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie
		no  no sir

				kurtz
		you came up my river  in that
		small boat so simple i
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky like
		we did
			pause
		you are the final justice
		arent you

				willard
		what do you mean colonel

				kurtz
			gently
		what other reason could you
		have come a captain ranger
		paratrooper graduate of the
		recondo school am i right
		about these things

				willard
		you know youre right

	there is a clear incredible intelligence about this man

				kurtz
		then the agency approached you
		maybe in a bar in quinon or
		pleiku simple a years pay
		for one life perhaps a village
		elder or a tax collector
		nobodys orders but your own
		exciting work


	235  close on willard

	he remains silent


	236  close on kurtz

	he smiles

				kurtz
		youve spent tome at the royal
		tracking school of malaysia
		i can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied
		i understand you captain we
		understand each other

	there is a long pause  as the two men regard each other
	then willard reaches to his holstered 45  withdraws
	it and places it on the dirt before kurtz as an act
	assuring kurtz that he is not an assasin

				willard
		do you know me

				kurtz
		yes

	kurtz reaches down takes the 45  and without another
	word or gesture shoots and kills a man

				kurtz
				continuing
		do you know me 

	he throws the 45 back on the dirt rises and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads moonby scampers off after him a respectful
	distance behind even willard is stunned

				chef
		holy shit

	239  full shot  wall  willard chef  lance

	willard walks along the top of a thick wall  sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an m60 or a mortar
	emplacement

	wild looking savages man these guns and seem to bow
	to willard as he passes

				willard
		this is good  triple overlapping
		fields of fire  walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces

	a woman tentatively moves to willard bowing and then
	runs off to her bunker

	we are tracking with them as they move past the groups
	of people huddled by their fires men women and
	children skulls shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut  adorn every sandbagged bunker  dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire a child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat

				willard
			continuing

		never told anyone about

	they continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying it has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire the wreck
	lays on its side so that a 762 minigun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags the emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond

	some americans barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner sit near the gun several
	montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets

				chef
		this is evil  evil captain
		were all gonna die here
