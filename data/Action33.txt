                          father
           yes my son

                          son
           tell me a story 

                          father
           which one

          a meteorite drifts into frame  heading towards tiny earth off
          in the distance

                          father
           millions of years ago  a meteorite
           made of vibranium the strongest
           substance in the universe struck
           the continent of africa affecting
           the plant life around it

          the meteorite hits africa and we see plant life and animals
          affected by vibranium

                          father contd
           and when the time of man came  five
           tribes settled on it and called it
           wakanda the tribes lived in
           constant war with each other until
           a warrior shaman received a vision
           from the panther goddess bast who
           led him to the heart shaped herb a
           plant that granted him super human
           strength  speed and instincts


          a visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands
          from the sand animation and we see them unite  and then
          break apart as conflict arises  bashenga rises above the
          conflict and eats the heart shaped herb proceeding to unite
          the tribes 

                          father contd
           the warrior became king and the
           first black panther  the protector
           of wakanda

                          father contd
           four tribes agreed to live under
           the kings rule  but the jabari
           tribe isolated themselves in the
           mountains

          we see the jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain
          region

                          father contd
           the wakandans used vibranium to
           develop technology more advanced
           than any other nation  but as
           wakanda thrived the world around it
           descended further into chaos

          we see images of war and slavery just outside wakanda  s
          secretive border 

                          father contd
           to keep vibranium safe  the
           wakandans vowed to hide in plain
           sight keeping the truth of their
           power from the outside world

          we see the protective barrier rise around the wakandan city 
          as we pull back on the earth as it spins now zooming in on
          another part of the world ·

          shuri uses her kimoyo beads to sync the suit to tchalla

           shur!
           pointing at the necklace
           now tell it to go on
          tchalla does and without warning millions of vibranium
          laced nanites spill from the necklace and form a new black
          panthersuit around the mannequin

          shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the
          same spot

           well maybe you should make it a
           little stronger  eh
          shuri shrugs as we see wakandan script built into the suit
          glowing indigo where the impact of tchallas foot landed
          tchalla looks closely at the glowing script

          he lands behind the 1st waveof border tribesmen  delivering
          a massive sonic blow that sends them flying as well as

          surrendering to the jabari and dora

          t challa up towards the lip of the track  as the train comes
          speeding towards them both their suits retract  and tchalla
          holds killmonger off as killmonger pushes the blade of the
          spear towards his face

          tchalla turns towards the train and sees that it is about to
          end
          he lets killmonger swing towards him and dodges  backing up
          even closer to the edge of the track and killmonger swings
          again  but this time tchalla punches killmongers arm 
          jarring the blade lose and sending it flying up into the air
          tchalla then does a rolling armbar takedown the

                          as broken
          spear flips through the air
          we track with the spear as the sonic stabilization field
          turns off  and the train passes the two fighters  as the
          brokenspear drops tchalla catches it with his right hand
          and slams it into killmongers chest just as both their
          suits form around them 
          killmonger removes his helmet  then looks down at the blade
          that is buried in his chest 
          tchalla realizing this is it  removes his mask as well

           nah  just bury me in the ocean
           with my ancestors that jumped from
           the ships    cause they knew death
           was better than bondage
