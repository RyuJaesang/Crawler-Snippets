                         dr evil as the legitimate frontman 
                         of your organization i seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         seattlebased coffee company several 
                         years ago today starbucks is a far

                         can increase our gross profits

               austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being 
               terrible he walks off as a crowd gathers around the car

               ext park  london

               austin enters the park in high spirits we pull back to see

               watching both of them from this distance we cant tell who

               austin gets into the dancing quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene the lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song

               austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number 
               begins involving the outdoor crowd a la bob fosses sweet

                         when we say hump you say how high

               three groovy chicks behind austin suddenly have tambourines 
               for the big finale the assassin and the mysterious woman 
               are both in the audience keeping an eye on austin all we 
               see of the woman are shots of her boots clothes and a female 
               symbol medallion

                                     austin

               austin holds the note an improbably long time arms 
               outstretched

               the song ends and all the dancers end up on one knee with 
               their arms outstretched panting austin breathes heavily 
               and smiles smugly like michael flatley lord of the dance

               we are tight on austins ass pull back to see that it is 
               the mysterious woman who is watching austins ass she smiles 
               behind the binoculars hiding her face

               37 ext carnaby st

               austin walks down the street looking at his new beatles album

               sitting in a parked citroen watching him is the assassin

               the aryan assassin nods to a shoeshine on the street

               the shoeshine boy nods to a business man in a homburg

               the business man nods to a bobby

               the bobby nods to a woman with a baby carriage

               the woman with a baby carriage nods to a mime

               the mime nods to a blind beggar with a tin cup

               the blind beggar nods to a carpenter on a roof

               the carpenter flashes a light to an indian chief

               the indian chief gives a smoke signal to a telegraph operator

               the telegraph operator sends a signal to the beefeater guard

               the beefeater salutes with his pike to a sexy ticket collector 
               on a doubledecker bus

               the sexy ticket collector signals a taxi driver

               the taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by

               int citroen

               the assassin gets the signal and starts the car the whole 
               nodding sequence was a circular waste of time

               him  he dives out of the way and takes off running he rounds 
               a corner and pretends to be a couple making out against a 
               wall by hugging himself

               the assassin sees him and slams on the brakes he raises his

                                     guru pitka
                         my name is the guru pitka i am a 
                         spiritual teacher and i have combined 
                         many disparate disciplines into a 
                         unified movement of human potentiality 
                         and equipoise that i learned from my 
                         guru the late guru shastri a chaste 
                         man who died mysteriously of a disease 
                         that strangely had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis he would say to me 
                         sparky love is all life is breath

                                     disciples
                         ahhhhhh!

                                     guru pitka
                         now perhaps you are wondering where 
                         i got the nickname sparky  well 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called stinkmop we would 
                         urinate into a bucket dip a mop 
                         into it and play tag i did not 
                         care for stinkmop and a very wise 
                         old man said to me oh lighten up 
                         sparky and i dont know the name 
                         kind of stuck

                                     disciples
                         ahhhhhhhh

                                     guru pitka
                         now the reason i am a spiritualist 
                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         therapist often becomes the rapist 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality now what is 
                         potentiality it is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves people often 
                         say to me that they feel nowhere 
                         and i am going to change that to 
                         now here

               the guru holds up a card which says nowhere = now here!

                                     disciples
                         ahhhhhhh

                                     guru pitka
                         and you have many assumptions about 
                         your goals but when you assume 
                         you make an ass out of u and 
                         me

               guru holds up a card which says assume = ass  u  me

                                     disciples
                         ahhhhhhh

                                     guru pitka
                         the being or that which we call 
                         ourselves is not the tinker  it 
                         is not the taughts it is the gap 
                         between the tinker and the taughts! 
                         we are not our mind we are not our 
                         body we are the gap!

               guru holds up a card that says not tinker not taughts but 
               the gap with the familiar gap font

                                     disciples
                         ahhhhh

                                     guru pitka
                              rapid fire
                         the heart of the matter is that you 
                         are the heart of the matter  there 
                         is no i in team beer before 
                         liquor never sicker dont take a 
                         wooden nickel  if your pipe is short 
                         and your pump is weak you better 
                         stand close or youll piss on your 
                         feet he who goes to bed with itchy 
                         bum wakes up with smelly finger

                                     disciples
                         ahhhhh

                                     guru pitka
                         finally the path to spiritual 
                         awakening requires the death of ego 
                         leggo of my ego! let us end with the 
                         mantra om ay vant yu uh mo ay 
                         vant yu uh mo ay vant yu hu

                                     disciples
                              chanting
