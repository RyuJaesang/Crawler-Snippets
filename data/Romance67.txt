          warden swings his chair around absorbs himself in work at
          his desk as if the prew situation is too absurd to concern
          himself with holmes speaks blandly winningly

           holmes

                          prew
           i just stopped sir after 
           maybe you heard about what
           happened
                         
                          holmeb
           you mean that fallow you hurt 
           the one that went blind
                         
          close shot prew
          prews lips are drawn tight he nods almost imperceptibly
                         
                         medium shot
          during this shot maggio can be seen in bg through door to
          orderly room he pretends to be sweeping but stops now and
          then to listen
                         
                          holmes
           yes its too bad about that i can
           understand how you feel but those
           things happen in this game a man
           has got to accept that possibility
           when he fights
                         
                          prew
           thats why i decided i would quit
           sir
                         
                          holmes
                          less warmly
           but on the other hand look at
                          more
           9
                          holmescontd
           it this way what if all fighters
           felt like that
                         
                          prew
           they dont
                         
                          holmes
           would you have us disband our
           fighting program because one man
           got hurt
                         
                          prew
           no sir i dint say 
                         
                          holmes
           you might as well say stop war
           because one man got killed our
           fighting program is the best morale
           builder we have off here away from
           home
                         
                          prew
           i dont want it disbanded sir
                          doggedly
           but i dont see why any man should
           fight unless he wants to
                         
                          holmes
           it looks to me like youre trying
           to acquire a reputation as a lone
           wolf prewitt you should know that
           in the army its not the individual
           that counts if a man wants to get
           ahead he has certain
           responsibilities to fulfill that go
           beyond the regulations it might
           look as though i were a free agent
           but im not nobody is
                         
          holmes waits hopefully for a moment then realizes prew is
          not going to respond further he stands prew snaps to
          attention
                         
                          holmes
           maybe youll change your mind in
           the meantime just dont make any
           mistakes in my outfit
                          to warden

          basket filled with papers on the floor in a moment the

          voices loud at first get softer and softer the nearer karen
          gets to camera at end of the shot as she is only a few
          yards away they are practically whispering

          closing the door behind him there is a moment of silence

           with a pile of bills big enough to

           all set for life 
                         
          there is a sound at the door and they turn towards it
                         
          medium shot door to hall
          as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through its
          hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle after a moment
          maggios head follows the arm through the door he is
          grinning like an amateur conspirator
                         
                          maggio
           i dint hear no sounds of combat so

           drink
                         
                         three shot
          as maggio comes into the room
                         
                          maggio
           or otherwise old sandra would of
           drank it all by herself shes a
           fine girl but she drinks like a
           fish
                         
          there are glasses on a cupboard near the divan maggio sets
          three of them up starts to pour whisky into them
                         
                          lorene
           no thanks i never drink much
                         
          maggio stops short of the third glass he takes a big gulp
          from the first
                         
                          lorene
           i think it a a weakness
                         
                          maggio
                          another gulp

           rises takes a drink
           but i like to drink
                         
          he comes back to the divan
                         
                          lorene
           with you its not a weakness with
           you its more like a virtue
                         
                          maggio
           that sounds like a very profound
           remark maybe thats why i dont
           get it
                         
                          lorene
           snuggles to prew

          he goes out closing door behind him suddenly the door opens
          again and maggio pops back in he puts the whisky bottle on a
          table next to the door

          he pops out again the door closing after him prews gaiety
          dims with the reference to the treatment lorene sees this
          prew rises goes to whisky bottle
           54

                          lorene
           what did he mean

           fight! i dont want to talk about
           it! i dont want to think about it
           and they make me think about it
           every day
                         
          he drops down on the divan beside her
                         
                          prew
           its a personal thing
                         
          his dread of telling the tale crumbles before his
          overwhelming need to tell it to have someone understand
                         
                          prew
           over at port shafter i used to
           fight middleweight i was pretty
           good i used to work out with dixie
           wells he was a lightheavy but he
           was fast and good he loved
           boxing he was gonna come out of
           the army and go right into the
           upper brackets people on the
           outside had their eye on him
           rises paces
           dixie didnt want to use the six
           ounce gloves this time and we
           neither of us wore headgear
           anyway i was set flat on my feet
           when i caught dixie wide with this
           no more than ordinary solid cross
           dixie just happened to be standing
           solid too
                          more
           55
                          prewcontd
           sits on chair
           from the way he fell i knew dead
           weight square on his face he dint
           roll over he was in a coma a week
           then he finally came out of it the
           only thing was that he was blind
           rises paces
           i went up to the hospital to see
           him twice then i couldnt go
           back we got to talking about
           fighting the second time and dixie
           cried seein tears comin out of
           those eyes that couldnt see
                         
          there are tears on prews face he turns away from lorene
                         
          another angle shooting from behind prew
          lorene very moved goes to him stands behind him puts her
          hand on his shoulder prew does not turn but his hand grasps
          hers camera moves to close shot of the hands
                         
          ext ocean and beach  night
                         
          medium shot near shore
          a wave sweeps by camera karen and warden riding it into
          shore camera pans with them as they walk out of the water
          hand in hand they stop at edge as if by a mutual impulse
          he swings her to him and kisses her
                         
                         closeup
          as they kiss the embrace is impassioned when their lips
          separate their arms remain around each other holding tight
          to something they find is more than sex alone
                         
                         extreme closeup
          as karen and warden kiss again a tenderness in him not seen
          before and which he normally takes great pains to hide
                         
          medium close shot
          as their lips separate again
                         
                          karen
           nobody ever kissed me that way
           not really
                         
          they are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to
          the kisses the jump to banter is a quick defense
                         
                          warden
           nobody
                         
          camera moves with them as they walk to the fire karen smiles
          at him
           56
                         
                         
                         
                          karen
           no nobody
                         
                          warden
           not even one out of all the many
           men youve been kissed by
                         
                          karen
           well that will take some figuring
           how many men do you think thereve
           been
                         
          camera holds as they sit beside the fire karen wraps one of
          the blankets around her
                         
                          warden
           i wouldnt know cant you even
           make me a rough estimate
                         
                          karen
           not without an adding machine do

           you

                          karen

           will you
                         
                          warden
           maybe i already know
                         
          the defense has given way and there is no mirth in the
          questions and answers now
                         
                          karen
           whats the matter what are you
           hinting at
                         
                          warden
           why is there something to hint at
                         
                          karen
           i dont know maybe a lot or maybe
           you just think theres a lot
                         
                          warden
           maybe i do maybe theres been a
           long line of beach parties 
           57
                         
                         
                         
                          karen
           you must be crazy  !
                         
                          warden
           am i listen baby maybe not here
           but what about when you and holmes
           were at fort bliss
                         
          karen flings off the blankets snatches her dress stands up
          raging she speaks as she pulls the dress over her head
          wriggles into it
                         
                          karen
           i had to go and forget you were a
           man  with the same rotten filthy
           mind the rest of them have for a
           minute i had to convince myself you
           were different 
                         
                          warden
           only its true aint it
                         
                          karen
           yes its true! a part of it some
           small part of whatever sewage
           youve been listening to some day
           perhaps youll get all the story
                         
                          warden
                          yaps up
           all what story
                         
                          karen
           youre getting to sound so much
           like a typical male so you just
           sweat it out like a typical male
                         
          she starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach walking
          fast then almost running warden runs after her
                         
          medium shot beach near path up rocks
          as warden catches up with karen he grasps her arm roughly
          hauls her down onto the sand he stares at her bitterly
          waiting f or her to speak
                         
                          karen
           all right ive never told it to
           anyone before but i think now is
           the time ill tell you the whole
           bloody messy thing you can take it
           back to the barracks with you
           58
                         
                         
                         
          she speaks rapidly pouring it out in bursts for much of the
          story her face is in shadow as if a cloud is passing across
          the moon
                         
                          karen
           id been married to captain dana e
           holmes two years only he was a
           first lieutenant then back at fort
           bliss we lived right on a little
           lake where we could fish and swim
           and be alone our dream
           cottage im sure you must be
           able to picture it it was off on a
           back road four miles from the
           highway two miles from a neighbor
           and a telephone
           pauses then rushes on
           i hadnt been married long when
           i knew my husband was stepping
           out on me but  you get used
           to that your mother tells you
           that its life that i t happens
           to a lot of women of course
           she doesnt tell you until after
           it happens
                         
          another angle featuring warden

           then by that time youre
           pregnant and at least youve
           something else to hope for i think
           i was almost happy that night the
           pains began even though they were
           weeks too early a whole month too
           early i remember dana was putting
           on that dapper silk gabardine
           uniform he used to wear he was
           going to an officers seminar he
           was kidding me about false labor i
           didnt think it was humorous i
           told him to get home early to
           bring the doctor with him he
           smiled tenderly and told me about
           the psychic reactions of women to
           pregnancy but never fear hed be
           back early and maybe he would
           have if the seminar hadnt
           been with the hatcheck girl in one
           of the night clubs

          the table starts to move on maggio rises picks up the
          heavy wooden stool hes been sitting on and smashes it down
          on fatsos head with all his strength
                         
                         another angle
          as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops
          abruptly fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but
          does not go down
                         
                          fatso

                          fatso
           still blinking from the

           thats the way you want to play!
                         
          with his last sentence fatso whips out a knife and snaps
          open the blade the blade is at least five inches long it
          glints evilly as he raises it there is a concerted whisking
          intake of breath from the room murder is clear on fat sots

          men are about to rise fatso whirls toward them

          medium shot fatso and maggio
          fatso turns toward maggio who circles back around the table
          as the other stalks him
                         
                          maggio

          fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder ready to strike
          warden comes into shot suddenly he brandishes a beer bottle
          wildly looks like an avenging spirit of authority
           73

          warden snatches another beer bottle from a table now has one
          in each hand he steps between fatso and maggio

          wagged edge at fatso roars

           put it down!
                         
          fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist but keeps it
          pointed towards maggio and warden warden deliberately turns
          his back to fatso spits his words at maggio

          fatso drops the knife it clatters on the floor there is
          another audible whoosh of breath from the room
                         
                          warden

           for you
                         
          he drops the beer bottles on a nearby table strides to his
          own table the room settles back still hushed warden has
          broken the mood of certain death but fatso still facing
          maggio bites off his words with sadistic ominous venom
                         
                          fatso

          medium shot wardens table
          warden stands beside the table watching he seems satisfied
          as fatso moves away from maggio still standing he raises
          his halffilled bottle of beer drinks

          prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor

          the door maggio and prew turn to watch him pass

          leaning against the building undergoing a delayed reaction
          to the fierce moment in choys he is whitefaced sweating
          heavily he looks as if hes going to be sick
                         
          close shot prew
          astonished yet appreciative that under wardens confidence
          and control in choys there has been a human frailty
                         
                          prew
            that was a near thing

           souvenir
                         
          prew puts the knife in his pocket they stare at one another
          a few moments each inarticulate each wanting to express
          some deep emotion of respect
                         
                          warden

          prew stares at him for a second incredulously unable to
          find his voice

          the victrola record ends alma turns away from prew and goes
          to the victrola now that shots had her say with such
          certainty she deflates except for the fact that she looks
          like a girl who never cries she looks as if she might cry
          she lifts the record off the turntable

          medium shot holmes and karen
          at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen holmes is a mixture

           one thing i know i know its a

           pick an army man
                         
                          karen
           i dont think its any of your

                          holmes
           it is my business! im your
           husband! what do you think a
           scandal would do to my chances for

           of a divorce you can forget it!
                         
          karen stiffens she struggles to maintain her self
          possession she manages it keeps outwardly calm through the

                          holmes

                          karen
           not very nice but then theres the
           compensation of knowing youll have
           to live with me the rest of your
           life
                         
          her attitude makes holmes progressively sorrier for himself
          camera moves with him as during following he rises goes to
          stove pours himself another cup of coffee he spills a
          little and the liquid sizzles on the burner
                         
                          holmes
           you dont know how a man feels

          prew drives his attack at his opponents body he never
          throws a punch at the others head

          the american flag the generals flag and the division flag
          are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office
          colonel williams is reading from a typed report
                         
                          colonel williams
            in addition to inefficiency
           in administering his command and
           neglect of duty captain holmes has
           been guilty of indefensible cruelty
           to the aforesaid private prewitt
           this extended to instigating and
           encouraging wholly unauthorized and
           discreditable tactics to force the
           soldier to join the interregiment
           boxing team these findings are the
           result of personal investigation by
           the inspector general and are
           corroborated by numerous members of
           g company
                         
          colonel williams puts his report on the generals desk
          holmes face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he
          has really expected something like this for a long time he
          makes no move to speak the general is angry clear through
                         
                          general slater

           holmes the first thing i ever
           learned in the army was that an
           officer takes care of his men it
           seems to be the first thing you
           forgot its monstrous to think of
           anybody like you in command of
           troops and believe me you wont
           be for long my only regret is that
           we have to keep you in uniform
           until a court martial is concluded
                          more

          opposite direction from the jeep which passed before it is
          also manned by three mps there is a startled cry from prew

          looking toward the jeep blinded by the blazing light he has
          the appearance of a terrified animal there is a wildness a
          senselessness about him the blotch of blood oozes and
          spreads over his shirt he picks up a rock from the road
