                         can handle a blue letter

               dramatic track in on norville as hutchinson talks he thrusts 
               the blue letter into norvilles face norville looks at it 
               with terrific apprehension as hutchinsons speech ends we 
               are tight on norvilles sweating face

               complementary tight dutch angle on hutchinson

               we can see the veins in his eyes the veins in his nose the 
               hairs in his ears

                                     hutchinson

               elevator doors

               rocketing open we move in on the young elevator operator 
               who leers into camera he wears a brassbuttoned uniform 
               white gloves and a pillbox hat the name buzz is stitched 
               onto his breast pocket

               as norville enters the elevators

                                     buzz
                         hiya buddy! the name is buzz i got 
                         the fuzz

               he lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut then 
               lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his 
               head

                                     buzz

                         duzz!

               he holds out his hand but as norville reaches to shake it he 
               snaps it away and pats down his crewcut

                                     buzz
                         hang it up to dry

               with a powerful downshifting sound buzz brakes the elevator 
               to a sharp halt norville continues upward with the inertia 
               painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator

               buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter

               buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator 
               into its powerrise norville bracing himself now sinks 
               only a little under the gforce

               the door sweeps shut norville looks nervously around

               behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again

                                     buzz
                          youll need it!

               the elevator doors slam shut and we hear its engines scream 
               as it powerdives away

               norville turns toward the executive offices

               plush thickcarpeted silence

               norville starts walking

               a scraping sound stands out in the highpowered executive 
               quiet norville looks to one side

               a workman in painters overalls squats in front of a pair of 
               heavy oak doors with a razor blade he is scraping off the 
               name waring hudsucker

                                     norville
                         mr mussburgers office

               the scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at norville

               with a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction

               norville enters the adjacent office

               outer office

               two secretaries are in mussburgers outer reception office 
               the first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the 
               fg her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder 
               as she stares at norville with an amused and supercilious 
               sneer which stays pasted on throughout

               the second secretary  the receptionist  is seated behind 
               a desk in the bg that flanks the door to mussburgers 
               private office the receptionist sits with her hands clasped 
               on the desk staring at norville with the hunchshouldered 
               downfromunder look of a patient vulture

                                     receptionist
                         do you have an appointment

                                     norville
                         uhh no i 

               the filing secretary sneers

                                     receptionist
                         shall we look in the book hmmmmmmmmm

               she opens an enormous leatherbound book with yellowed crinkly 
               pages

                                     norville

                         we dont seem to be in the boooook

               norville is groping in his apron pocket

                                     norville
                         no maam ya see i dont have an 

                                     receptionist

                         the booook

                                     norville
                         i know but ya see i have this  
                         here it is this letter 

               a low unearthly wail fills the room the sound of a million 
               souls moaning in purgatory

               the receptionist looks up

               fast track in on sneering file secretary

               who is no longer sneering her mouth is stretched wide as 
               she wails and her finger points

               fast track in on blue letter

               that norville holds innocently at his side

               back to track in on wailing secretary

               as her wail becomes deafening and we track into her mouth 
               and the screen goes black and

               click

               the blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound 
               of a door opening we are

               int mussburgers office

               its door swinging open to admit norville

               in the bg in the outer office we can see the filing 
               secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag 
               draped across her forehead the receptionist is fanning her 
               with a towel

               the door closes behind norville

               we hear a rhythmic clickclickclick and the hum of 
               ventilation

               norvilles pov

               across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk behind which 
               is a large executive chair facing the window from above the 
               back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up a telephone cord 
               snakes around to the man sitting in the chair hidden from 
               us on the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large 
               swinging ball bearings clickclickclick

               a tickertape machine occasionally burps information in the

               hudsucker clock on the facade of the building  rumbles by

                         this better be good im in a bad 
                         mood

               norville clears his throat

                                     norville
                         well sir ive got something for 
                         you from the mailroom but first if 
                         i could just take a minute or so 
                         from your very busy time

               he reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper 
               across the desk to mussburger who stares frozen at 
               norville making no move to take the paper

                                     norville
                         to show you a uh

               norville undaunted holds up the paper since mussburger 
               will not take it mussburger doesnt even look at it his 
               eyes are locked on norvilles mussburger smolders

                                     norville
                         a little something ive been 
                         working on for the last two or three 
                         years

               mussburgers burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look 
               at the crudely drawn circle he looks back incredulously at 
               norville

                                     norville
                         you know for kids! which is 
                         perfect for hudsucker  not that i 
                         claim to be any great genius like 
                         they say inspiration is 99 percent 
                         perspiration and in my case id say 
                         its at least twice that but i gotta 
                         tell ya mr mussburger sir this 
                         sweet baby 

                                     mussburger
                         wait a minute!

               sudden quiet

               with one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings 
               abruptly stop

               as mussburgers eyes burn in on him norville stands mute 
               and paralyzed

               his eyes locked on norvilles mussburger circles the desk 
               he stands toetotoe with norville

               he thrusts his face into norvilles whose head moves 
               reflexively back mussburgers nose is almost touching 
               norvilles his eyes are burning searching studying 
               evaluating

               finally he draws his head back

                                     mussburger
                         hmmm

               with one hand he thrusts his cigar into norvilles gaping 
               mouth with his other hand he raises norvilles chin so that 
               his teeth clench it

                                     mussburger
                         ummhmm

               he steps back eyes still on norville

               he jerks his thumb over his shoulder indicating his chair 
               behind the desk

                                     mussburger
                         siddown

               norville his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger 
               looks bemusedly from the chair to mussburger

                                     mussburger
                         go ahead try it on

               norville obeys reluctantly stiffly

                                     mussburger
                         put your feet up

               norville is again reluctant

                                     mussburger
                         go ahead

               norville obeys mussburger studies

                                     mussburger
                         hmmmm lets get to know one 
                         another shall we

               norvilles eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing 
               from between his teeth mussburger seems to relax

                                     mussburger
                         lets chat!

                                     mussburger
                         you werent blessed with much

               he waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a 
               euphemism

                                     mussburger

                         hmmm

               norville sputters out some more cigar smoke

                                     norville
                         at the muncie college of business 
                         administration

                                     mussburger

               norville shakes his head

                                     mussburger

                                     norville

                         succeed!

                                     mussburger

                                     mussburger
                         get your feet off that desk

               as he struggles to comply

                                     norville
                         but 

                                     mussburger
                         get out of my sight

               norville squinting against the cigar smoke pulls the cigar 
               out of his mouth as he doubles forward feet still up groping 
               for a place to set down the cigar he sets it blindly on a 
               loose stack of papers

                                     mussburger
                         my god! the bumstead contracts!!

                                     norville
                         oh my god sir!

               the top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the 
               cigars live end

                                     mussburger
                         you nitwit! i worked for three years 
                         on this deal!

                                     norville
                         oh my god sir!

               norville runs across the office to a large water cooler

                                     mussburger
                         ill take care of it just get out!

               mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it 
               into a wastebasket he pats the fingertips of one hand against 
               his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange 
               circle on the top sheet of the contract

               at the other end of the office norville is wrapping his 
               arms around the glass water tank which he pulls off its 
               base he runs back across the vast expanse of office toward 
               the desk hugging the water tank whose water gloobgloobs 
               out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees

               as he reaches the desk the nearempty tank is now light 
               enough for him to hoist with one arm which he does and 
               cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water 
               he tosses the tank to the floor where 

               crash  it shatters and stands looking about for a place 
               to dump his handful of water

                                     mussburger
                         why you nitwit you almost destroyed 
                         the most sensitive deal of my career!

                                     norville
                         oh my god sir!

               he is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk 
               which mussburger cannot see

               it is sprouting flame at which norville ineffectually flecks 
               his remaining drops of water

                                     mussburger
                         now out of here! out!

               norville is already running to the window which he runs 
               both palms over desperately seeking a way to open it

                                     mussburger
                         not that way! through the door!

                                     norville
                         but sir!

               the windows do not open norville furiously stomps on the 
               flames in the wastebasket and  his foot sticks

               further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up 
               and down with his foot

                                     mussburger
                         right away buster! out of my office!

               norville has dropped to the floor trying to wrench the 
               flaming wastebasket off his leg

                                     mussburger
                         up on your feet! we dont crawl at 
                         hudsucker industries!

                                     norville
                         sir my leg is on fire!

               norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket 
               off his foot now the problem is what to do with it

                                     mussburger
                         get out of this office you dithering 
                         nincompoop!

               norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle

                                     norville
                         oh my god sir!

               he winds up and throws it through the closed window

               the glass shatters and the flaming basket plummets to 
               oblivion

               with the picture window broken a ferocious draft roars through 
               the penthouse office

               close shot  bumstead contracts

               on the desk the pages are sucked away by the draft

                                     mussburger
                         my god! the bumstead contracts!

                                     norville
                         oh my god sir!

               mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out 
               the window

               he runs jumps onto the sill grabs  his fist clenches 
               around one wafting page  he is about to fall 

                                     mussburger
                         eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!

                         jump out a window too!

               in the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper 
               fluttering down

                                                                    cut to

               we hear a loud tearing sound os mussburger drops a few 
               inches

                                                             quick wipe to

               back to mussburgers pants

               the tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops the rest of 
               the pants hold intact

               mussburger

               sighs with relief

               he looks up

               norville

               norvilles arms are wrapped around mussburgers ankles the 
               heels of mussburgers shoes are digging into his face

               mussburger

               looking thinking

               norville

               struggling to hold on

               mussburger

               calm contemplating

                                     mussburger
                         hmmm

               he absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks 
               it in his mouth he holds his lighter under the cigar not 
               noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way

               he looks at norville

               norville

               his face drawn with effort still struggling to hang on

               a pull back from the extreme close shot reveals however 
               that norvilles arms are now wrapped around  emptiness

               mussburgers legs are gone

               norville throws his head back and laughs it seems insanely  
               but continued pull back reveals that norville is merely 
               pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board 
               members including mussburger they stand around mussburgers 
               office laughing gaily all safe now no harm done this 
               inaugurates

               a norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of 
               the neardisaster mussburger is slapping him merrily on the 
               back

               angle

               pull back to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper 
               photo on the front page of the manhattan argus

               its headline reads untried youth to helm hudsucker

               the subhead reads stockholders wary the subsubhead reads 
               meteoric rise from mailroom

               the article is under the byline of amy archer

               continued pull back reveals that we are looking at the 
               newspaper over someones shoulder the person swivels around 
               and away  his face now to us we see that it is norville 
               looking at the newspaper he throws his head back and laughs 
               merrily

               as he laughs  thwock  a steaming towel is thrown onto 
               his face and he continues to swivel continued pull back 
               reveals that he is in a barber chair

               his head drops back and out of frame as the swiveling chair 
               is cranked down but immediately  still spinning 

                his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again

               still laughing norville is now freshly shaven and has a 
               slickedback haircut heavy with pomade

               freeze on norvilles laughing face

               angle

               pull back to reveal it is another front page photo next to 
               the headline hud board to street give man from muncie a 
               chance subhead has fresh ideas

               continued pull back reveals that the paper is lying on a 
               chair norvilles mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to 
               cover it

               pan to where the apron was tossed from norville stands on a 
               tailors stage laughing as the tailor also laughing takes 
               his measurements norville in shirtsleeves boxer shorts 
               hose stockings and garters

               the tailor rises laughing merrily throwing up his arms and 
               spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape

               norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide

               board member

               laughs merrily his arms thrown wide tickertape stretching 
               between his hands he joyously tosses away the tickertape

               floor

               where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged 
               tape

               pan up to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its 
               disastrous tale of good news for the board

               pan up further to reveal that the machine is in mussburgers 
               office at the far end of the room behind his desk 
               mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper

               track in towards him

               on his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing outside his 
               window the sweep second hand of the hudsucker clock rumbles 
               by sweeping a shadow across the floor evil prevails

               as mussburger opens the newspaper the continued track in 
               shows its front page headline hud stock dips subhead just 
               good is he

               chin propped in his hand

               photograph

               comes to life and norville unfreezes laughing

               we are now tracking back from him he sits behind a huge oak 
               desk newly coifed and tailored

               the brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the office 
               of the president

               track back continues through the large elegant office leaving 
               norville looking quite small in long shot

               his laughter echoes in the bright bare office

               norvilles laughter is just winding down leaving him 
               exhausted as if he has been laughing nonstop for several 
               days he finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye

                                                                  fade out

               fade in

               new york skyline  day

               in the skyline we can see the hudsucker building topped by 
               the hudsucker clock

               a cigar enters frame in the fg then the face of the man 
               smoking it staring contemplatively at the hudsucker building 
               he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his 
               mouth and waves it as if painting a headline

               for the staff meeting although they listen quietly they 
               are more bored than attentive

               through the glass walls we can see the furious activity of 
               an army of reporters editors and copy boys waging the never
               ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper

               the editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust

               without even looking in its direction the editor has slammed 
               down the lid of the cigar box on his desk towards which one 
               reporters hand had been idly reaching

               the reporter jerks his fingers away as the editor spares the 
               briefest moment to glare at him

                         in a period of transition for the

               and indeed she does faint dead away falling backwards on 
               the stool so that norville has no choice but to catch her

               norville holds her awkwardly looking around for help

               a waitress enters extreme fg to block our view of the

               facing the camera and the two os veterans the cropping 
               gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she 
               holds

               back of the waitresss torso in fg on either side beyond

               int norvilles office

               looking at its frostedglass door the sign painter is just 
               finishing lettering in norville barnes president

               the sign painter makes way as we see norvilles shadow 
               approaching even from inside the room we can hear that he 
               is wheezing heavily he is apparently carrying the girl 
               cradled in his arms he tries to reach down to get the 
               doorknob cant manage it turns to press his back against 
               the door and get the knob with his other hand

               the door opens as norville swings around to enter he is 
               wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode

               he swings around to kick the door shut we see that the 
               lettering on the door is now terribly smudged we also see 
               in wet ink on the seat of norvilles pants senrab ellivron 
               tnediserp

               weakly still cradled in norvilles arms

                                     amy
                         im sorry we had to take the stairs 
                         it was just that horrible little 
                         elevator boy

                                     norville
                         not at all youre light as a feather

                              pointing languorously
                         the couch please

               still wheezing horribly norville staggers over to the couch 
               and deposits her gently on it he straightens up and looks 
               at her

               norvilles pov

               she is smiling wanly at the camera the entire image pulsates 
               as the blood pounds behind norvilles eyeballs

               we hear the loud rasping of his breath resonating inside 
               his head amy is talking but her voice is barely audible as 
               if coming from a long way away

               back to scene

                                     norville
                         just a minute

               he perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his 
               head between his knees still fighting for breath

                                     amy
                         i dont know what came over me i 
                         suppose it was the shock of eating 
                         after so long without the enzymes 
                         kicking in after so long or whatever 
                         but then you couldnt possibly know 
                         what it is to be tired and hungry

               speaking into his knees as he wheezes

                                     norville
                         hungry anyway

                                     amy
                         i dont want to bore you with all 
                         the sordid details of my life its 
                         not a happy story

               norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her 
               head

                                     amy
                         suffice it to say that im jobless  
                         though not for want of trying that

                         that had you not come along at just 
                         exactly the moment that you did 

               she screams staring down at the couch

               norville jumps startled then looks where she is looking

               on the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is 
               printed in wet ink right side around norville barnes 
               president

                                     amy
                         norville i didnt know you were 
                         president here!

               norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion when the 
               nickel finally drops he spins around to try to look at the 
               seat of his pants

               distracted but still modest

                                     norville
                         oh its nothing really just 
                         determination and hard work

               he unbuckles his trousers

                                     norville
                         of course when i started in the 
                         mailroom last tuesday i thought it 
                         might take more time 

               buzz enters holding a brown paper bag

                                     buzz
                         say buddy heres the whiskey you 
                         asked f 

               he freezes taking in the scene amy reclining on the couch 
               norville standing in front of her with his pants around his 
               ankles still breathing heavily the bottle of whiskey in 
               his own hand

                                     norville
                              flustered

                         happy days buddy

               as he turns to leave

                                     buzz

                         not to be disturbed yowzuh!!

               he snaps the elastic strap under his chin

               after the doors shut behind buzz

                                     amy
                              shuddering
                         what a horrible little person

                                     norville
                         oh buzz is pretty harmless really 

                                     amy
                         at any rate i arrived in town not 
                         ten days ago full of dreams and 
                         aspirations anxious to make my way 
                         in the world 

               norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her

                                     amy
                         a little naive perhaps but  thank 
                         you  armed with determination a 
                         solid work ethic and an indomitable 
                         belief in the future 

                                     norville
                         i myself 

               he crosses back to the desk

                                     amy
                         only to have that belief that 
                         unsullied optimism dashed against 
                         the marble and mortar of the modern 
                         work place 

               norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box 
               on the desk and sticks it in his mouth

                                     norville
                         cigarette

                                     amy
                         no thank you seek and ye shall find 
                         work and ye shall prosper  these 
                         were the watch words of my education 
                         the ethics of my tender years 

               over norvilles shoulder

               he has been pushing the box towards her the box tilts lazily 
               forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk we 
               hear the thud of the box landing amid the pitterpatter of 
               cigarettes raining onto the carpet

               amys brow crinkles continuing

                                     amy
                          these were the values that were 
                         instilled in me while i was growing 
                         up in a little town youve probably 
                         never heard of 

                                     norville
                         mind if i join you

               he is pouring himself a drink

                         be my guest a little town youve 
                         probably 

               he tosses back his drink gags looks at amy with his eyes 
               bulging

               his pov

               once again her image pulsates there is a roaring sound and 
               an airy steam whistle as she silently moves her lips

                                     norville
                         he waves his arms and talks with a 
                         thick rasp as he staggers to his 
                         feet

                                     norville
                         excuse me  i  executive 
                         washroom

               he staggers out a side door

               on his exit amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his 
               desk at the top of her voice

                                     amy
                         are you all right

               she throws open the top desk drawer inside two lonely lead 
               pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer

               amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a 
               match off the desktop

                                     amy
                         is it your lunch the chicken a

               amy throws open another drawer empty except for an 
               appointment book as she hurriedly flips through page after 
               blank page an arctic wind whistles emptiness one page only 
               has a notation 1145 address wilkie grammar school junior

                         is the a la king repeating on you

               amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer

                                     norville os
                         im fine i you were saying

               she mutters

                         never heard of

               she hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to 
               disperse the smoke

                                     amy
                         muncie indiana

               she scurries back across the room as we hear the faucet being 
               turned off she restrikes her languid pose on the couch 
               just as the washroom door opens

               norville gapes one hand pressing a dripping rag to his 
               forehead

                                     norville
                         youre from muncie!

                         why yes do you know it

               norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and 
               loud syncopated grunting noises amy gapes at him

               he starts singing offkey

                                     norville

               amy lamely fakes singing along coming in louder on the last 
               obvious rhyme norville jumps an octave on it she quickly 
               follows sit also pumping her fists

               as norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of 
               his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers

                                     norville
                         goooooooo eagles!

               amy awkwardly imitates

               norville excitedly sits behind his desk

                                     norville

               fill the screen we glide among them and finally come to 
               follow one couple norville and mrs mussburger a large 
               middleaged woman of the margaret dumontmold in an 
               elaborately flowered and oldfashioned evening gown lowcut

               she throws her head back and roars with laughter

               angle  their feet

               as the large woman leans back to laugh her feet stay planted 
               on the ground and norvilles rise to be dragged with his 
               toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance

                                     mrs mussburger

               as amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown she 
               looks around the room then starts across the crowded floor 
               towards the punch bowl

               norville

               as mussburger introduces him to a tall imposing businessman 
               in a tuxedo and a tengallon hat

                                     mussburger

                         stockholders

               ignoring norvilles proffered hand

                                     cardozo businessman

               norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance

                                     norville
                         no need for concern sir its only 
                         natural in a period of transition 
                         for the more timid element to run 
                         for cover 

                                     cardozo
                         so im yella am i!!

               he starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket

                                     cardozo
                         well see whos yella!!

               his wife a small wiry woman steps in as mussburger starts 
               dragging norville away

                                     mrs cardozo

                         sech an ole grizzly

               as he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket

                         aww i wasnt gonna hurt the boy 
                         lorelei

               mussburger and norville

               as they make their way through the room norville is mopping 
               at his brow with a handkerchief

                                     norville
                         im sorry sid i thought maybe if i 
                         showed him the long view we might 

               thump! dabbing at his brow norville has walked square into 
               the back of a debonaire man holding a martini

               the drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him

                                     mussburger
                         norville this is thorstensen 
                         finlandsen who heads a radical 
                         splinter group of disgruntled 
                         investors

               norville nervously pumps findlandsens hand

                                     norville
                         hello mr finlandsen so sorry to

               findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at norvilles 
               handkerchief which he now holds himself apparently having 
               been given it during the handshake

               he hands it back to norville

                                     norville
                         thank you sir

               he stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as 
               findlandsen stares at him mussburger stands watching in the 
               executive atease hands dug into his pockets

                                     norville
                         i understand your concern about 
                         the downward you know but i think 
                         youll find under our strong new 
                         leadership

               as norvilles hand drops from his breast pocket the 
               handkerchief perhaps caught on his sleeve whips out of the 
               pocket and follows his hand down

               findlandsen looks down and norville follows his look and 
               stoops below frame to retrieve the hanky

               findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at 
               norville who continues os

                                     norville os
                         we anticipate in short order an 
                         upward

               in rapid fire norville straightens up into  crunch  
               findlandsen whose head snaps back eyes rolling a hand 
               pressed to his nose drink sloshing norville one hand 
               pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly 
               waving his hanky for balance takes a staggering step forward 
               onto the toe of an elegantlygowned mrs findlandsen

                                     mrs findlandsen
                         ahhh!

               there is a drum roll and as the lights dim

               emcee

               grabs the large oldfashioned microphone in front of the 
               band and grins

                                     emcee

                         of romance the incredible the 
                         unforgettable mister vic tenetta!

               vic tenetta takes the microphone from the emcee who backs 
               away applauding as tenetta starts to croon he wears a white 
               dinner jacket his jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead 
               in a roguishly pompadoured mat one forelock droops and 
               bounces across his forehead

                                                                    cut to

               several board members

               clustered in a dim corner of the room smoking cigars

               in the bg brilliantly spotlit vic tenetta continues his 
               song

               as mussburger joins them

               ext penthouse  terrace

               where the party noise is distant tenettas song just 
               filtering out

               we are on a full shot of the back of a man who stands facing 
               the twinkling cityscape but in an odd leanedback posture 
               with one hand reaching up to his hidden face his other hand 
               pressed against the small of his back like a man with a 
               stiff neck tossing back a drink

               reverse

               amy having just emerged onto the terrace squints at him

                         norville

               he turns and we see that it is indeed norville holding a 
               dripping icepack against one eye

                                     norville

                         previous life amy

                                     amy
                         oh i dont know maybe i was just a 
                         fasttalking career gal who thought 
                         she was one of the boys 

                                     norville

                         that kind of person would come back 
                         as a wildebeest or a warthog no i 
                         think it more likely that you were a 
                         gazelle with long graceful legs 
                         gamboling through the underbrush 
                         perhaps we met once a chance 
                         encounter in a forest glade i must 
                         have been an antelope or an ibex 
                         what times we must have had  
                         foraging together for sustenance 
                         picking the grubs and burrs from one 
                         anothers coats or perhaps we simply 
                         touched our horns briefly and went 
                         our separate ways

                                     amy
                         i wish it were that simple norville 
                         i wish i was still a gazelle and 
                         you were an antelope or an ibex

                                     norville

               as we track in on norville laughing there is a low 
               unearthly rumble and his face seems to dissolve into

               flames

               we pull back from the flame of sid mussburgers oversized 
               lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar

               he is sitting alone in the boardroom but its door swings 
               open and norville enters wearing plaid knickers a little 
               cap and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge 
               he has a full golf bag over his shoulder

                                     norville

                         the company

               he is shoving a file towards norville who opens it

                         out

               we track down the length of the board room table toward 
               norville who stares horrified at the file

                                     mussburger

               she looks hopefully for some effect but after staring at 
               her for a slackjawed beat norville can only bring out

                                     norville

               he lurches off his stool toward the door watching him 
               despair fights with confusion on amys face

               descending

               norville

               falling turning lazily in the air  and suddenly with a 
               great moaning sound  he stops suspended in midair head 
               down feet in the air

               it is much like the freeze frame on waring hudsucker that 
               the title of the film was supered over

               he waves his arms to no effect looks around

               people in street

               frozen in attitudes of laughter celebration snow sifts 
               silently down around their motionless bodies

               mussburger

               in his office frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his 
               face

               his perpetual motion balls

               frozen one ball swung out but suspended hanging at the 
               apex of its arc outside the great arched window snow falls

               norville

               he alone can move but doesnt fall he looks awkwardly about 
               his body in a divebomber attitude canted steeply down

               ext hudsucker clock

               its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep

               whining noises emanate from within

               close shot  great gear

               the broom handle has been jammed between two cogs stopping 
               them we pull back along the handle to reveal moses who has 
               thrust it there and who now turns back over his shoulder to 
               address the camera

               norville

               twisting back to look up over his shoulder there is a distant  
               very distant  singing

               looking up the length of the hudsucker building someone or 
               something wrapped in white is flying toward us coming down 
               from the stars

               we can make out a male voice accompanied by strumming

               rimless glasses in a white robe large feathery wings 
               sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes 
               to rest in midair he puts aside the harp he has been 
               strumming on a nearby windowsill

               presenting himself he spreads his arms and stamps his forward 
               foot forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to 
               stamp he lurches forward momentarily losing his balance

                                     hudsucker

               he lights the cigar off his thumb takes a puff

                         resignation boilerplate  go down 
                         to the second paragraph

                                     norville
                         many years uh i know that you 
                         will be wondering why i have decided 
                         to move on ending my tenure at 
                         hudsucker and here on earth you 
                         will be thinking why now when things 
                         are going so well granted from the 
                         standpoint of our balance sheet and 
                         financials sure sure were doing 
                         fine however sid these things 
                         have long since ceased to give me 
                         pleasure i look at myself now and 
                         no longer see the idealistic young 
                         man who started this company now i 
                         see only an empty shell whom others 
                         call a success how has this come 
                         to pass when and why did i trade 
                         all of my hopes dreams and 
                         aspirations for the emptiness of 
                         power and wealth what the heck have 
                         i done

               as norville reads hudsucker casually examines his fingernails 
               then pats down a yawn

                                     norville
                         looking back now sid i see 
                         that i allowed time and age to corrupt 
                         my dreams instead of fiercely 
                         guarding what was timeless inside of 
                         myself i let the hubbub of earthly 
                         commerce erode my character and 
                         dissolve my better self how is it 
                         that some manage to preserve 
                         themselves where i have failed 
                         sidney i do not know perhaps if 
                         others love you you may more securely 
                         love yourself  but i am alone i 
                         loved a woman once sid as you well 
                         know  a beautiful vibrant lady 
                         an angel who in her wisdom saw fit 
                         to choose you instead of i

               norville is interrupted by loud blubbering he looks up

               hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief

               he saws at his nose gives it a loud honk and urgently 
               quavers in a voice strangled with emotion

                                     hudsucker
                         skip this part

               he waves his hankie in getonwithit circles

                                     hudsucker
                         last paragraph last paragraph

               norville looks down the page

                         who may more energetically wage the 
                         battle against corruption 
                         accordingly in the spirit of hope

               he roars with laughter

                         thatll show the bastard!

               he merrily wipes his eyes

                                     hudsucker

                         closely with the new president and 
                         to keep giving hudsucker industries 
                         all your energies  but not your 
                         soul for while we must strive for 
                         success we must not worship it 
                         long live the hud waring 
                         hudsucker

               norville gives a musingly appreciative nod

                                     hudsucker

                         it gets delivered in the morning

               hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the 
               stars

                                     hudsucker

               mussburgers office

               mussburger still sits frozen in his chair outside the great 
               arched window hudsucker rises through the falling snow on 
               his way back to the heavens

                                     hudsucker

                         comes

               we hear a great wrenching sound from the gear room next door

               gear room

               moses pries the broom handle loose from the great gear

               with a low moan the clockworks start to shudder and turn 

               sweep second hand

               lurching forward 

               perpetual motion ball

               swinging down 

               ext pavement

               as norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face 
               with one last mighty bong of the hudsucker clock

               boom down

               from a tavern sign that says anns 440 down to the front 
               door which norville is entering

               int anns

               sitting halfway down the bar is amy staring morosely into a 
               coffee cup at the cut we are tracking back pulling away 
               from her

               norville enters comes up next to her and makes the go eagles 
               sign hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading 
               his fingers

               two familiar voices narrate the scene sounding a little 
               tipsy

                                     lou os
                         what the hecks he doin benny

               amy looks at norville startled after a moment she 
               reciprocates the sign

               our pull back ends looking across an elbow of the bar towards 
               norville and amy now in wide shot resting on the bar in 
               the extreme fg are two champagne glasses halffull of 
               fizzing champagne

                         it is beautiful benny

               almost weeping as norville and amy continue their embrace

                         saw

               a bartender enters to block our view of norville and amy

               he is youngish with a beat goatee wearing dungarees and a 
               sweatshirt with cutoff sleeves he looks to either side at 
               benny and lou

                                     bartender

               reverse angle

               we see benny and lou are sitting side by side at the bar

               lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long 
               flowing robe he holds a fake scythe on the bar next to him 
               sits a large hourglass

               benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper a baby 
               bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly 
               that says 1959

               he chucks himself in the heart cocks his head and sucks in 
               air then blows it back out

               blue letter

               lying on the boardroom table as a hand enters to lay a 
               wristwatch on the table next to it we hear the voice of 
               moses the old maintenance man

                                     moses vo
                         and so began 1959 the new year

               the hand reenters to lay down a wallet and then to deposit 
               a burning cigar in an ashtray

                                     moses vo
                         and the start of a new business 
                         cycle when he learned that norville 
                         owned the compny ol sidney was 
                         upset at first

               we tilt up to show that mussburger is walking toward the 
               boardroom window board members silently remonstrate with 
               him as he tries to wrench it open

                                     moses vo

                         bromfenbrenner was there

               doctor bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching brow 
               furrowed a pencil pressed to his lips

                                     moses vo
                         cause he was able to keep sidney 
                         from harmin his ol self

               we

                                                                    cut to

               barred door

               being slammed behind sidney who straightjacketed is puffing 
               on a cigar as he is led away

                                     moses vo
                         now norville he went on an ruled 
                         with wisdom and compassion

               boardroom

               again norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on 
               an easel under the heading brand new is a large circle the 
               side view is a flat line

                                     moses vo
                         and started dreamin up them 
                         excitin new ideas again you know 
                         for kids!

               the board members look at the design puzzled

               norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a 
               pedestal he has the boards complete attention

                                     moses vo

                         norville barnes climbed away up to 
                         the fortyfourth floor of the
