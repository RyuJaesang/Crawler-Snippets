fade in





ext istanbul  dusk

glimpses of an ancient city   almost motionless against
the tide of time
sea swelled along an endless wall billowing silk frozen
against the sky birds lighting on byzantine columns
final image is of an imposing structure beyond the trees




int prison for the criminally insane

corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite
darkness stale air hangs in the dim halflight like
atomized ether
there is whispering   and tangled voices
drift in past prison cells the size of closets brief
flashes of carved faces insanity  coming to rest on the 




final cell

a gaunt prisoner kneels on the granite head bowed to a
wall hung tapestry of christ but hes not just praying
hes digging with his arm under the tapestry he
scratches at the stone with a spoon after only a year
the spoon finally breaks through




int narrow channel

prisoner claws his way between ancient walls comes to a
dead end against a thick wooden door he nudges a
shoulder against it digs in and pushes door groans
open sucking air into the pitch black chamber




int prisoners cell

the tapestry covering the hole is pulled against the
wall then billows outward like a sail




int chamber  prisoner

pulls himself inside chokes in the heavy air he scans
the musty room antique furniture a few empty crates
and the remains of several deteriorating skeletons

                                             continued

he looks to the far wall sees a hint of light above
through the crumbling limestone a way out too high to
reach prisoner pulls an old chest out of a cobwebbed
corner and slides it under the light
he steps up onto the chest grabs the edges of the hole
and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives
way and his foot crunches through
prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees
something inside  wrapped in a red cloth he pulls it
out and as he unwraps it he discovers the cloth is a
nazi flag
at the center is a crudelyshaped iron relic eight inches
long stains on the edges could be the petrified tooth of
some prehistoric animal or maybe an ancient arrowhead
as he holds it feverish sweat starts to form on his face




mysterious pov

from behind as if hes being watched by someone else
prisoner spins looks back at us nothing




prisoner

starts toward the way out




int prisoner corridor

the guards flashlight beam probes the cell  one by one
 falls on the tapestry christ billows out from the
wall revealing the hole




int prison  various shots

alarms sound    lights blast on   guards with weapons rush
through




int narrow channel

prisoner squeezes toward light grips the relic tight




ext prison  night

sirens blare as spotlights sweep across the ominous
structure prisoner breaks from the darkness runs for
the trees on the other side of the wall

                                           continued

                            guards

                      in turkish
             stop!   stop!
prisoner spins griping the relic tight gunshots ring
out bullets streak toward him but never hit their
target guards check their weapons on the run




ext near a road  night

prisoner breaks from the trees runs into a road
headlights wash over him and tires screech prisoner
spins is right in the path of a car
brakes squeal  car locks up but too late  impacts
prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap
car slides to a stop driver jumps out sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires
he scans the area for a body spots the prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet uninjured
prisoner is just as amazed he glances at the relic in
his hand notes the wrist has reddened and an odd symbol
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh
driver calls out but the prisoner is spooked runs off
over this we hear  a childs scream




int apartment  day

father hennessey 50 stands over a young teen 13
jeanie splashes holy water on her body she screams
again

                           hennessey

             et separatur a plasmate tuo ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes!
her body convulses pulls against the bandages tying her
hands and feet to the bed frame notice her fingernails
drained of color almost black
her mother is off to one side completely hysterical
on the other side is a crowd of bewildered tenants all
crammed into the hallway outside the opened door

                                                continued

nothing can compare with an exorcism   especially one
thats gone bad
the rather obese priest tries to steady his hands and his
heart its obvious hes totally out of his league here
girl lets out another scream that echoes over 




ext aging apartment building

not in a third world country but smack center in one of
americas richest cities sparkling highrises tower in
the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest
fashions the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor

ext alley by the apartment

a faded yellow taxi pulls up and stops someone steps
out grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt




int apartment building  foyer

doors open flood the musty darkness with a brief relief
of sunlight a man  whose face we dont see  steps
inside his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of
a raven
he pauses pulls an ornate lighter and lights a
cigarette takes a puff and pushes on inside




int narrow staircase hall wall

lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the
unexplainable
the stranger pushes through suspicious faces step out
of his path the ones that dont he pushes aside  even
the gangbangers
the man has no patience for politeness no time for tact
no fear of anything
this man is john constantine
he arrives at his destination barges into

one scan of the situation is all it takes the bed 
the child  the panicked priest  who rushes to john

                        hennessey

                  whispering
          thank god youre here
john shoots him a disgusted look    hennessey gives him a
wide berth
john walks past the panicstricken mother without a
glance sets his cigarette on the nightstand the glowing
tip drooped over the edge he puts a gloved hand to the
childs face and it burns on contact his demeanor
instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of
the little girl and whispers 

                        john

          this is constantine john
          constantine asshole
the girl jolts bandages on her arms cut into her skin
eyes snap open  glare right through him

                          john

          how ya doing

                        jeanie

john whips out a key chain crammed with medallions

                        john

          lets see who we got here
he holds them up so they cast shadows across jeanies
face he flips through each of these sculptured saints
until the child suddenly reacts to one  tries to look
away
john stares at the saint responsible seems genuinely
puzzled he turns to the mother  very serious

                        john

          i need a mirror now
shaken the mother produces a small compact   john pushes
it away turns to the doorway crowd

                        john

          a large mirror at least 
                  sizes up the child
           three feet high

the bed around legs gouging hardwood all the way faces

four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror the
old woman follows begs them to be gentle they swing
the mirror around take out a chunk of banister she
freaks




int apartment 7b

hennessey can only watch as john threads the drapery rope
through the fire escape railing drapes it back through
the window and loops it over the ceiling fan
he climbs onto the bed leans over the child whose eyes
have closed and shes shaking badly her body seems to
be going into shock isnt strong enough for this
john has no choice  slaps her eyes pop back open
dark and dilated he yells down at her in aramaic and
english

                        john

          amar natash bow basar!  rescind
          from the flesh i command thee 
the girl chokes as if ready to spit

                        john

          thats it  time to go home
jeanie screams 

                        jeanie

          tiempo para morir!
her body suddenly pulses half again larger john recoils
for a beat odd he continues in aramaic 

                        john

          amar natash bow basar 
another pulse and this time a shape is clearly seen
expanding under the childs skin  as if the demon
inside were trying to burst right through
john backs off  watches as the shape ripples her flesh
like fingers caressing from the other side john glances
to hennessey what the hell
mirror arrives at the doorway bangs against the jam
john waves them in the four men heft it into the room

                         john

          lift it   over the bed   up

girl positions his head between her and the mirror above

                           john

             now close your eyes  all of you
              and whatever happens  do not
             look into the mirror
the men close their eyes        muscles tense under the

             amar natash bow basar!  rescind
             from the flesh i command thee!
jeanie reacts  that shape reappears contorts the young
body all out of proportion
john unblocks the mirror for a second and jeanie is
reflected inside its not just the image of a young
girl in there but something else the surface of the
mirror flexes in the hands of the men one starts to
look 

                             john

             no!
jeanie screams  breaks free of the straps she rises
up grabs john tight around the throat nails dig deep

john struggles puts his hands over her mouth  cutting
off her air supply question is whos going to pass out
first
jeanies body is racked by whatevers inside her she
goes into shock body collapsing  shaking  close to
death

medallion that caused the earlier reaction 

                           john

             goddamit  look!
 and presses it against her forehead eyes snap wide
and john unblocks the mirror jeanie locks on her
reflection and the image in the mirror changes
drastically

                           john

             smile pretty you vain prick
the childs reflection has now changed to a pissed off
demon one that knows it just got suckered in
mirror vibrates wildly in the mens grip demon
reflection ripples the glass  bending it outward into
threed space as the girl takes her last breaths 

                           john

             now hennessey now!
hennessey pulls the rope with all threehundredplus
pounds as john gives the demon face a full extended

finger


                             john

             for your boss
demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion
swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of
wood 

                             john

             no you dont
john jumps up and helps push the mirror free




ext apartment building  huge mirror

falls slow motion from the 7th story  tumbling end over
end sunlight beams glancing off the glass projecting
the image of the demon into the la cityscape onto
buildings sidewalks a passing truck  until all three
hundred pounds of iron and glass come crashing down on
the taxis hood

             shit!

demons image shatters on impact  glass splintering
into a million diamondlike fragments that choke the air
the groan of something evil reverberates into the city
beyond
chaz looks up sees he missed dying by three feet




int apartment  continuous action

jeanie gasps  takes her first breath as a child again
and cries mother pulls her in hugs her tight note
the girls fingernails no longer black
johns beat reclaims that stub of a cigarette still
burning takes a drag he pushes past hennessey who is
approaching the mother

                           hennessey

             now about the fee
john slips from view into the kitchenette hides the fact
that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance
he catches his breath looks up and is staring right at a
childs crayon drawing magneted to the fridge a drawing
of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick
this image is repeated over and over
john tugs it off the fridge tucks it away




int apartment building  stairwell  later

hennessey follows john down the spiraling stairs passing
the gathered tenants a few are freaked cross
themselves others horrified but many want to touch
them shake their hands
a shadowy figure several floors up stares over the rail
at the heroes below note the slick suit the polished
veneer
this is balthazar and he definitely does not rent here
he flicks an ancient coin between his fingers
john pauses gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing
something no one there balthazar is gone

angela peeks over the track     still no sign of her perp
the train is coming into view and its beam shoots through
the tunnel turning every particle of dust into a supernova
the sound is deafening

she grips her gun and in one burst of flatout bravado 
rises as she aims
and there he is  the man rising with his own gun
angela fires as both dive off the track his bullet
ricochets behind her hers finds its mark man goes
down right in the trains path

stops at a pearlwhite dazzler
he lifts it from the rack steps out into the prep
area  in front of one of the few lanes not in use
number 13
john snatches a grease pencil from the overhead
scribbles right on the ball  provisions depleted
he fluffs his trench coat back steps onto the polished
wood with his welltraveled oxfords
young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity
an attractive brunette is rather curious john gives her
a wink her boyfriend doesnt appreciate it
john bowls perfect hook ball strike! brunette grins

then reaches behind his neck 

                           john

             itll be like old times
 and unclips the amulet from hennesseys neck that
unnerves the big guy john drops it in hennesseys
pocket

the unthinkable
cityscape of lights are spread out below but angela is
seeing something else

reflected in her eyes 

is a city engulfed in red flames follow that tear with
the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek
and slips into her mouth
angela shudders rubs her wrist where we see the skin has
swelled and reddened just like the prisoners and
theres that same circular symbol in the flesh
she wipes her tears  tries to be strong takes a few
breaths for courage them simply steps off




int barrys room

barrys wide eyes follow her down

ext somewhere in istanbul  day

a pickup truck crosses a barren landscape
in the back bed are several goats and one prisoner
he grips the relic tight in one hand   that anxious fever
has returned
glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising
jetliner in the distance  dart back to the road theyre
on  heading the opposite way
prisoner clamps his eyes tight grips to the relic
tighter
eyes snap open and he turns thrusts his elbow through
the center window leans in and grabs the driver  jerks
his head back against the bulkhead  cracking it in the
process
prisoner latches onto the wheel takes control he
swerves the car off the pavement gets out and takes over
as driver
truck continues on bouncing through a shallow ditch and
into the field beyond aiming straight for the rising
airliners in the distance

coming to rest on a window covered with aluminum foil

every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum
foil a sober hennessey stands surrounded by decades of

in check
he instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet
but its not there oh yeah  in the pocket decision
made he reaches up starts tearing the foil from the
walls and the window

ext echo park downtown la  day

john sits at a park bench motionless taking in the
world clouds passing the sun shadows drifting across
the city leaves swirling after passing cars
john just sits there hearing every breath he takes
wondering which one will be his last

                         ellie os

          lung cancer   lung cancer!
john turns to see ellie 23 strutting up the sidewalk
uninhibited oozing sex appeal but dangerous in more
ways than you think

                        ellie

          thats funny as shit john

                        john

          on yourself

does

             you but to even ask that all

             soldiers sent back to him in
             chunks hes going to take all
             that out on you john and hes
             going to enjoy ripping your soul

             so i take that as a no

                           ellie

             here to collect and you know how
             much he despises this place

                           john

ellie sits back down strokes his arm

                           ellie

like scratching fingers across a blackboard     no way

in armanis best the other is father garret
john stands to the side and waits for their conversation
to end an attendant makes the rounds

                           angela

             so youre rude no matter where you
             are
john gives her a look the two men shake hands and start
to part john and angela make their move toward the men
both are surprised when angela goes for father garret and
john goes for 
 the snob officially known as gabriel       yes that one




father garret

and angela have retreated to another area for privacy

                           angela

             why is he stalling on this my
             sister needs a catholic funeral

                           father garret

             angela its still considered a
             mortal sin 

                           angela

             she didnt commit suicide

                           father garret

             the bishop has read otherwise

                           angela

             father david  this is isabel
                     meeting his eyes
             please
father garret stares at her tries to be compassionate

                           father garret

             ill talk to him again
but angela has just lost a load of faith




by the fireplace

gabriel sits in his chair watches the fire with
unblinking eyes john approaches from behind and against
the backdrop of flame sees the nebulous shape of wings
the ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat

                           gabriel

                     without looking back
             i know what you want son

                                                continued





                                                         38

john sits across from him

                           john

             been keeping your allseeing eye
             on me have you

                           gabriel

             i could offer how a shepherd leads
             even the most wayward of his flock
             but it might sound disingenuous

                           john

             so youre going to make me beg
angela pauses on her way out looks over

                           gabriel

             it wouldnt help youve already
             wasted your chance at redemption

                           john

             what about the minions ive sent
             back the souls that ive saved 
             that should guarantee my passage
             across 

                           gabriel

                     keeping it private
              no  passage requires faith
             and faith by definition is belief
             without proof you have proof
             and that means youre not playing
             by the same rules as everyone
             else your work has mostly been
             for selfish reasons im sorry

                           john

             this is bullshit  bullshit!
now hes really got angelas attention

                           john

             its like youve got some cosmic
             scale weighing everything we do 
             help an old lady across the
             street  put in a nickel kick a
             dog take out a dime  youre
             fucking nickel and diming us to
             death down here!

                           gabriel

             keep your voice down

                                                continued

john jumps up leans into his face

                           john

             and you know what youre the ones
             with the problem not us  you make
             these impossible rules to decide who
             goes up who goes down and you dont
             even understand us 
this more than anything gets under gabriels skin

                           gabriel

             each of you is born with the
             promise of salvation preordained
             the cost of your redemption is
             simple belief and yet you whine
             about impossible rules sometimes
             i imagine you hardly deserve the
             gift you have been given

                           john

             gift! more like a curse the way
             you manage things
gabriel stands and towers over john

                           gabriel

             i am taking your situation into
             account john but dont push me

                           john

             why me gabriel its personal
             isnt it i didnt go to church
             enough i didnt pray enough i
             was five bucks short in the
             collection plate why
gabriel moves right up to him makes this very personal

                           gabriel

             youre going to die because you
             smoked 30 cigarettes a day since
             you were 15 and youre going to
             hell because of the life you took
             or to put it in a way that your kind
             would understand youre fucked




ext theological society  minutes later

angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour
she hears a cough looks over to see john standing on the
other side looking equally frayed they share another
glance

                                           continued

john fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket        empty

                           john

             he has a rotten sense of humor
                     steps past
             and his punch lines are killers
john tosses the cigarette pack walks right into the
rain away from chazs taxi pulling up

                            chaz

                      shouting out
             john   its raining! hey!
angela watches john disappear in the rain looks down at
the empty cigarette pack

                                          dissolve to





int hennesseys apartment  a cigarette pack

lies on the floor next to food wrappers coke bottles and
stacks of newspapers hennessey sits amongst the
garbage slumped over but hes not sleeping
hes surfing the ether allowing his sixth sense to
guide him his hands move down and across the stacks of
newer periodicals fingers probing the layers of
information
left hand suddenly stops
hennesseys eyes open he removes the layers of periodicals
on top of his left hand leans close edges his fingers
away and sees an obituary a name  isabel dodson




ext la streets  evening

john walks the streets numb to the world a rat
scurries past near the curb then another several
crows fly by
above him is a billboard  your time is running out
doesnt matter that below it is  to buy a new chevy
the point is crystal clear john shakes his head breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit
he leans to a gutter another rat scoots past john
barely notices then a frog jumps past but its the
crab crawling by that finally catches johns gaze

                                                continued

                           voice of man os

             hey buddy you got a light
john turns settles on a silhouetted figure standing
behind him unlit cigarette butt in its mouth

                           old man

                     coughs
             we gotta stick together right
john gathers himself as he walks over to this old man
he rummages through his coat pocket retrieves a
matchbox
the box shudders as a highpitch fluttering filters from
inside old man winces as his entire body vibrates
john realizes  this is beemans matchbox the one with
the screech beetle inside and now he knows  a beat
too late
old man attacks
john is knocked onto his haunches as the old man closes
in hes revealed in more detail body and face are
actually an intricate puzzle an assemblage of city
vermin rats insects crows frogs crabs  all held
together in the shape of a man
john scampers backwards just inches from this beings
outstretched grasp he shakes the matchbox and the
screech beetle inside flutters again
old man/demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart
for a second then snaps back together he grabs onto
john with fingers of squirming vermin snake wraps
around his wrist crab snaps at his skin
john shakes the beetle box harder  causing the parts to
vibrate even further old man grabs johns head and
vermin of various leg count crawl right onto johns face
johns had enough  shakes the matchbox violently then
smashes it against the sidewalk
beetle lets out a death shriek and the old man
stutters  his parts vibrating so wildly you can
actually see the bg through the seams
john scampers loose grabs a road barricade and swings it
with all his might old man form shatters on impact

the entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of
scattering critters john starts stomping on them as
they scatter into the city
john stands there shocked and concerned      what the hell
is going on




int angelas apartment  day

that surveillance video footage from ravenscar plays
again theres isabel in her nightgown walking across
the roof
spread out on a cluttered coffee table is isabels case
file coroners report is opened lets see no drugs
in system and the biggie  cause of death  suicide
angela sits on the couch in her robe      disheveled and
distraught shes taking this hard

                           angela

             im sorry isabel
she lowers her head     and in that brief moment of

angela snaps back to the tv freezes in shock
theres isabel ready to jump but this time shes looking
right back at us  at angela then shes gone
angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence
again this time isabel doesnt look back this time
there is no name but angela did see it did hear it
she sits for a second     stunned

and cheerful and the dark and mysterious that abandoned

spider runs across the table john flips an empty glass
traps it underneath he takes a drag on his cigarette
tips the glass and blows smoke inside spider cant
escape the poison air bumps the glass trapped dying

                           angela

             she was a patient at ravenscar
             then last tuesday she just decided
             to step off the roof

                           john

             i thought you said she was murdered

                           angela

             isabel would never take her own life

                           john

             youd be surprised at what people
             will do

                           angela

             look i know im not making much
             sense  hell im not really sure
             what im doing here i just
             feel  the circles you travel
             in  the occult demonology
             exorcisms
john just stares at that spider in the glass       trapped

                           angela

             i believe someone got to her mr
             constantine brainwashed her into
             stepping off that roof some kind
             of legion or cult

                           john

             sounds like a theory   good luck

                           angela

             well i thought with your
             background and experience you
             could at least point me in the
             right direction

                            john

             yeah okay   sure
john points  toward the exit      angela is not amused
but shes not giving up

                           angela

             my sister always talked about a
             world better than this heaven as
             some call it she wasnt afraid
             of dying because she knew it was
             waiting for her what everyone
             fails to grasp is that if she had
             really taken her own life

                            john

              she would have committed a
             mortal sin and her soul would have
             gone straight to hell where it
             would never feel love or
             compassion or anything but pain
             again as the master himself rips
             her apart over and over for the
             rest of eternity
                     beat
             that about right
the words have hit so hard that angela is speechless
john sees the hurt in her eyes would like to take it
back  but its too late
she turns and starts out slows 

                           angela

             youre not the only one afraid of
             hell
john tries not to let that get to him she leaves he
glances out the window watches her pass by so long
good riddance
but somethings not right those deep shadows on the
buildings seem to be moving john watches confused
realizes theyre heading in angelas direction

                           john

             oh shit
he stands gains his bearings as he walks out he flicks
the glass over spider runs free




ext 20 lanes bowling alley  night

cars are lined all the way down the street angela walks
along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her
its joined by another in the trees  both closing in
with each step

                           john os

             detective!
angela looks back sees john in the street

                           john

             how open is your mind

she doesnt answer continues walking what she doesnt
see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes but
john does he starts walking toward her

                           john

             do you believe in heaven and hell
                     off no answer
             how about what comes out of each
angela keeps walking      he catches up with her

                           john

             hey!

                           angela

             you mean like angels

                           john

             and demons
angela stares at him continues walking       he keeps up

                           john

             see you dont have the mindset
             for this kind of work
they walk together down the lonely street

                           angela

             look i see terrible things every
             day a mother drowns her baby a
             tenyearold shoots his father
             but its not demons its the evil
             that men do
behind them a streetlight blinks out then another
theyre not looking back so they dont see it

                           john

             youre right were capable of
             terrible things but we usually
             justify it with motives like money
             and power and jealousy
another light fizzes blinks out

                           john

             then sometimes something comes
             along and gives us just the right
             nudge and we do truly evil things
             just for the kick of it

                                               continued

                           angela

             i dont believe in demons

                            john

             you should   they believe in us
they pass another streetlamp as it goes bright then
blacks out both look up
the next lamp flares then fizzes out
angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind
them she looks to john but hes staring straight
ahead because now the light in front of them is flaring

bright


                           john

             we should go
second later it blinks off         john grabs her hand 

                             john

             fast
angelas confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural
wind races toward them
john jerks her into action they run towards the next
light it blinks out right when they reach it
they race to stay in the light aiming toward the safety
of the brightlylit statue of the good shepherd




ext holy cross cemetery

they make it through the gate pass through an alley of
overhanging trees something ripples through the
branches  flitters right past angelas face she swats
at it manages to get a branch across the cheek
they near the good shepherd and the floodlights flicker
fade out statues of saints become dark monoliths
john stops in an open area between trees and a mausoleum
a lit cross on the wall provides the only illumination
angela feels the scratch on her cheek sees a trickle of
blood now she hears sounds in the darkness like
leather rubbing surrounding them

                             angela

             what is that

                                                  continued

john is just as surprised hes saying this

             wings

                           angela

             wings
john rummages through his trench coat  fishes out that
cloth beeman gave him the one supposedly wrapped around
moses

                           john

             and maybe talons
the cross is getting dimmer and dimmer

                           angela

             are you kidding of what

                           john

             something thats not supposed to
             be here
john quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand
angela spins eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get
closer  ghastly sound of movement in the fringes of
light
the cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with
every second the circle of light gets smaller and those
sounds get closer john takes out his special lighter

                           john

             close your eyes
they are now standing in pitch darkness

                           angela

             why

                           john

             suit yourself
john flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion 
sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand
sacred cloth catches fire  then ignites with a
brilliant retinasearing flash  blinding angela and
illuminating a 
 circle of winged demons  a roiling broth of
reptilian death  right there  ready to pounce

red flame radiates from the cloth and demons shriek as
they are instantly vaporized
john tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket
extinguishes the flame he leans down to a rubbery stain
left from one of the burnt demon carcasses shakes his
head in disbelief

                           john

                     to himself
             i accidentally crossed over    i
             dont think so

                           angela

                     coming up behind
             what was that i saw wings  and
             teeth  they were flying what
             the hell were those things!

                           john

             they werent angels
john scans the area trying to think this through

                           john

             seplavites actually scavengers
             for the damned
                     off her lost look
             demons

                           angela

             what you cant be serious
             this is impossible

                           john

             yeah
                     to himself
             and i dont think they were after
             me
john looks at her with renewed interest

                           john

             you really believe she wouldnt
             commit suicide

             never in a million years

not exactly an inviting place
hennessey steps off the curb looks up at his
destination




int angelas apartment  night

john stares at a photo of angela and her father in police
uniform obviously happier times
angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box
that gray cat follows close to her heels

                           angela

             these are all isabels things

                             john

             yeah why
john ignores the box of items picks up the cat he
studies it a bit then sits back in a chair with it

                           angela

             dont you need candles and a
             pentagram for this to work

                           john

             i need you to step outside now

angela wants to stay

                            john

             angela   please
angela reluctantly moves toward the exit john holds the
cat stares into its huge unblinking eyes theres a
moment where animal and man seem to connect
the water around johns feet begins to boil
angela pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on
its way to latch
bulbs pulsate as current ramps down the room flickers
is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim halflight and john
has now crossed over into 




apartment in hell

same layout different decorator john takes a deep
raspy breath slowly stands he turns to the wall behind
him which is torn away looking like some halfbombed
structure in beirut
beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a
nightscape but a sickly sepia glow not quite day not
quite night
john steps over the crumbling wall into 




ext hell los angeles

john walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze
of intersecting freeways burntout husks of long
forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock a low drone
penetrates the silence

                             john

             is she here
on the horizon is a dying red sun    it strains to cut
through the putrid brown haze

                             john

             is she here!
his voice reverberates to infinity

                                             continued

john cautiously steps closer to the railing looks down
to the ribbons of twisting streets below theyre
crammed with teeming masses of the damned all walking
down in silence faces numb with sorrow and grief

                              john


             is she here!

that low drone rises in pitch and john now spots a huge
blanketlike blackness crawling over the cityscape
rapidly closing in on him you get the feeling this
isnt a safe place for the living

                            john

             its a simple question!    is she
             here or not!!
john suddenly locks on something far off
on top of a distant skyscraper is a female figure in a
sheer white gown john cant make out her face but knows
shes looking right at him

                              john

             isabel
she lifts something and tosses it john watches as a
small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing
darkness

in that same motion we left her in  angela finishes
pushing the door closed as it latches 

                           john os

confused angela pushes the door back open cat bolts
out angela catches her breath moves inside




int living room

john sits slumped in the chair drained steam rises off
his skin angela sees the water in the bucket has almost
all boiled out she walks in kneels down to him

                              angela

             john     what happened

sweat drips off as he looks up he opens his palm 
reveals to angela a simple hospital band the name
isabel dodson is typed on it
even as a semiconvert this news completely floors
angela she takes the plastic band  grips it tight 
tries to hold herself together the adrenaline and pain
overwhelm her knee buckle and she drops to the floor
john watches isnt sure how to help he finally reaches
out a single hand  slowly rests it on her shoulder
the contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and
angela falls right into his arms john hasnt been this
close to anyone in a long time angela finally composes
herself

                            angela

             how   how did you do this
john tries not to stare into those eyes too long     fails




int la county morgue  night

body drawer slides open  reveals isabel lying in a
cold sterile room of death a hell of a different type
hennessey stares down at her looks around the room
again makes sure hes still alone
he reaches in rips open the protective plastic and
lowers his hand inside places it first on her forehead
nothing then on her chest nothing wrist is last
hennessey shudders this is it
he closes his eyes and opens himself to the void

something shivers up hennesseys leg and into his body
eyes glaze over and hennessey settles on a restaurant

             the world behind the world its
             crossing over thats the real
             trick thats why most demons can
             only whisper in our ears but
             even a whisper can turn your
             favorite pleasure into your worst
             nightmare




int late night restaurant

hennessey barges in squeezes past the maitre d

                           maitre d

             sir you need a reservation!
but hennessey is on a quest     for food   and its
everywhere
he starts grabbing meals right off of plates fish
pasta prime rib shovels it all in patrons are
yelling  screaming hes eating as if his life
depended on it and even though hes devouring anything
in sight this huge man is wasting away before our eyes
in the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly
eating his meal balthazar
hennessey hijacks a food cart  consumes everything on
it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside
gets thinner
he grabs a steak from a womans plate but she jerks it
back so he bites into his arm she screams as her
husband pulls her away
hennesseys strength is withering away desperate he
grabs a fork digs it into his own hand
a hispanic busboy rushes into the room grabs onto
hennessey

                           john vo

             but the worst demons are the ones
             that are allowed to be here  the
             ones that are halfhuman so they
             blend in
balthazar stands throws a few bills on the table and
starts toward the back exit

             angels touch living alongside of
             us the halfbreeds
that busboy lowers hennessey to the floor for a moment
we see him framed against the front doorway and in that
instant we get a brief glimpse of 




alternate los angeles

an incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light




back to scene

busboy looks up meets balthazars eyes bitter enemies
balthazar grins flips that coin between his fingers he
leaves out the back exit

             your way into heaven

                           john

             well what would you do if you
             were sentenced to a prison where
             half the inmates were put there by
             you

ext restaurant  later

the morgue is seen across the street     the guard that
chased hennessey is just outside

                           weiss os

             security guard spotted him near
             the body chased him out
we move past angela standing with weiss       around them is
a complete shambles of fine dining 

                           weiss

             he comes over here makes a run at
             the entire menu and pow 
             deflates like a fricken macys day
             balloon
 come to rest on johns shattered face he stares down
at hennessey now yards of loose flesh sunken over an
assemblage of bones only that ragged black tie he wore
is familiar now
john leans down to the remains of his friend a cop
starts to intervene but angela blocks him let him be
john has trouble taking this in reluctantly reaches into
hennesseys coat pocket  finds the protective amulet he
himself removed from his friend thats even more
crushing

                                               continued

             why didnt you call me you fat
             sonna bitch
john lowers his head then spots blood stains on one of
hennesseys hands he opens the fingers studies the
fork wound the blood is already drying over it
john reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube
he pushes it into hennesseys hand wiping away the dried
blood it quickly becomes apparent  this isnt random
stabbings this is a shape
john takes a napkin lays it on the palm and presses
residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin
its the same circular symbol we saw on isabels wrist
john doesnt know what it is but he knows its important

                           john

                     to hennessey
             rest in peace father

appears from around the corner walking with a boy its
barry the boy in the courtyard
he locks on angela and when she makes eye contact he
breaks away from the nurse runs toward her with arms
outstretched

                           john

             what would you leave her what
             would it be where would it be!
             where would it be
angela lashes out shoves john hard pushing him out of
her way she turns to the window almost hyperventilating
john stays back watches angela opens her eyes the
tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees 

                             angela

             the tree




ext courtyard  night

a lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard
john and angela approach it examine it nothing john
drops lower on the tree to a childs height   finally
sees something near the ground gestures to angela
she kneels down next to him sees what he sees
that same symbol the one hennessey carved into his
hand but this time theres more

                           angela

                     trying to
                      rationalize
             there must have been a tree in our
             backyard when we were kids
john may not be buying it but hes not saying anything
his fingers trace these words carved below the symbol 

                             john

             there is no 14h act in corinthians
johns face goes pale 

                           john

             i need a church




int hospital chapel  minutes later

several families sit in solemn prayer the pastor
comforts a man and wife john and angela slip through
head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall
they whisper

                           john

             corinthians goes to 21 acts in the
             book of ethenius its like a
             dark mirror of the bible it
             paints a different view of
             revelations says that the world
             will not come to an end at the
             hand of god but be reborn in the
             embrace of the damned

                           angela

             theres a difference

                           john

             depends on which side of the fence
             youre standing
john stops casually sticks his hand in the pastors bowl
of holy water near the altar

                           angela

             so why havent i seen this book
             before

                           john

             because it doesnt exist here on
             this side
john closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to

boil 


                           angela os

             what do you mean 
flickering candlelight slows to a stop catching angela
midquestion and the room in that dim halflight
john turns and is inside

same chapel  hell

the epitome of blasphemy  a church in hell only they
dont worship god in here and thats not christ on the
cross and those stained glass windows are now slate
black
john is now facing books with completely different
markings he searches as a drone rises in pitch and an
inky blackness begins to flow down the walls getting
closer to john with each heartbeat
he finds the book steps back as he closes his eyes

int 20 lanes  behind the lanes

beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp the narrow
alley of machines stretches out behind him he stares
into the scrolls  an ancient book with a single page
folded a thousand times turns another page




bowling area

amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when its
closed rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness
the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of
beasts

                           beeman os

             oh my




behind the lanes

beeman has stopped turning pages thats because hes
now staring at an etching of the same symbol below are
ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body
but its whats above the beast that is most troubling
a figure on a cross  his arms outstretched  seemingly
welcoming the beast into this world

                           beeman

             this is not good
bowling ball hits a lane     beeman spins to the sound
ball rolls round and round closer and closer until it
clangs dead against the back wall of one of the lanes
beeman gets up starts down the corridor of dormant pin
machines
he stops at lane 13 leans way way down past the
machinery and peeks out the pin hole

                           beeman

gets her up to speed

           the myth says mammon was conceived
           before his fathers fall from
           grace but was born after




int suv


                         john

           but unlike his old man hes never
           been in the presence of the creator
           so he has no fear of him no respect
           either that goes double for us 
           gods most prized creations mammon
           would be the last demon wed ever
           want crossing over

                         angela

           but demons cant come and go
           thats what you said

                         john

           unless they found a bridge
                   off her look
           some psychic with the chops to
           reach all the way to hell and the
           grit to withstand whatever shit
           shed pull out

                          angela

           isabel

                         john

           but even a bridge wouldnt help
           mammon because to cross over the
           myth says hed still need the one
           thing he could never get divine
           assistance the help of god
angela sits back letting that sink in

                         angela

           so its impossible

                         john

           impossible sure its impossible
           thats what makes it so dangerous
           these things exist to break the
           rules to find the loopholes if
           the past is any indication then
           the future isnt on our side

             herself but it doesnt make
             sense

                           john

             makes sense to me

             john she sacrificed herself to
             beat him
john nods     your point

                           angela

             why is she in hell
one of those rare moments where john has no answer




int 20 lanes bowling alley

something small and shiny is rolling down the alley      it
lands in the trough spins round and round 
beeman leans out to try and see what it is      the silver
object keeps spinning
he waits for it to stop swats a fly near his face      then

john leans closer spots a hand protruding from the
mound

                           john

             oh jesus no 
he rips his coat off flings it at the mound and million
flies scatter  revealing the body of beeman ravaged
flies pouring out of his mouth his ears

angela lies there and panic sets in she starts to
surface but john pushes her head back to the bottom
holds it firm her eyes dart about air is running out
she cant hold her breath much longer its not
working 
but the rooms lighting begins to pulsate  as if the
current were ramping down it slows to that dim half
light as 
johns eyes  close     a single blink
angela is lying in now boiling water screaming for all
of her life water muffles the sound but not the fury
huge tub shudders hard  snapping out of the hold down
bolts john is stunned  how powerful is this woman
another scream and the inchthick tub cracks     water
starts streaming onto the tile
john lunges grabs angela and pulls her up from the
water  her muffled screams shattering the air as her
mouth breaks the surface she slams hard against his
chest  arms wrapping tight  fingers digging into his
back  leaving marks that might just scar
tub gives way and the damn breaks john and angela go
down  hit the tile as one  water washing over them
both
angela lies there on top of john trembling      she looks
up him eyes filled with revelation

slightly the demon in him he touches his face does a
vowel stretch his face distorts even further

in motion rippling as if liquefied and just when he
sees the surface of the mirror blistering and starts to

john swings the flame aside so he can kick balthazar
against the wall but now his weapon sputters shit
charcoal hand thrusts out bats away the shotgun and
grabs john by the throat
balthazar rises from the ashes     he may be burned but
hes one tough son of a bitch
balthazar slides    john up a wall by his neck john cant
break his hold     hes choking frantically rummages
through his coat    pockets comes out with those sacred
gold knuckles on    his right hand
balthazar tightens his grip and john swings clocks him
across the face the enhanced punch sends a dizzying
ripple throughout balthazars body
but he doesnt let go john is choking starts whaling
on him again and again  each punch weakening this
demon more
john finally gets him against the wall right arms
tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand
and with extreme pleasure  continues punching away
drives balthazar to the floor right to the brink of

                           ellie

             oh john this is embarrassing
             where is your pride
 right under a sprinkler head

                           john

             go to hell
ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger




series of shots

ellie and a room of halfhumans  all looking up as
water sprays from every nozzle john and midnite tense
because the first drops have no effect a beat  a
spurt in the waterlines and suddenly  shrieks fill the
room as half human skin begins to fry

                           ellie

             holy water!
emergency lighting has snapped on  throwing the room
into a strobing nightmare of action flashes of human
skin melting revealing snippets of the true demons
underneath its total pandemonium as their rage is
directed toward the only real humans in the room
john and midnite fling their coats open  draw their
weapons and starts firing away at the attacking horde
sacred bullets cause major damage  wounds that ripple
out through demon bodies
john and midnite slam back to back  spinning under the
protective shield of a showering sprinkler head 
shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture
into the column of spray
one reloads while the other fires its a hellish form
of a turkey shoot nothing sacred nothing spared
john goes for the double doors midnite covers him 
blows away another two disintegrating demons two come
up behind and he spins takes them down
john gets to the doors starts to open them when ellie
jumps onto his back  nails digging in

                           ellie

             im not going back there!

                                               continued

             we are what we are ellie 
john fires over his back loosens her grip he grabs
hold shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead
sprinkler head legs flail about
midnite comes out of the rain  grabs john

                           midnite

             lets go
john drops ellie to the floor no more pretty face  no
face at all  yet the screams still come
john and midnite get to the doors  shove through




int physical therapy room

angelas body and face are completely submerged now she
comes to sees barry above her  tries to rise but the
boy pushes her head to the bottom holds it there last
bubbles are floating up from her mouth barry places his
other hand on her arm closes his eyes




int corridor

holy rain has stopped in here a fine mist floats in the
air john and midnite make their way through only
their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence
another set of doors is ahead before they reach it a
faint shadow crosses in the mist both pause expecting
something to reveal itself but it doesnt




int physical therapy room

faint waves undulate barrys skin  ripple from his
chest down his arms and into a submerged angela every
muscle in her body tenses in stark relief




angelas pov

barrys image ripples above her in silence room
lighting starts to pulse  slower and slower and when
its caught in that dim halflight  angela jolts and
this time we cross over into

physical therapy room hell

angela is lying in a bonedry tank lifts her head up to
see a room not much different than the one she just left
except for the sound that low drone rising in pitch 
those demonic screeches scratching at the walls
and now those inky splotches begin consuming the color
and light from the walls moving in on angela closer
and closer  whatevers coming is just about on her

                         mammon os

          angela
angela spins and for a split second comes face to face
with the hideous form of mammon she screams




int normal physical therapy room  real time

john and midnite burst into the room spot barry standing
in the tank his hands in the water on angela

                          john

                    rushing toward him
          barry!
barry looks up sees the two men rushing toward him
guns aimed

                         john

          let her up!!   let her up!!
a beat as john meets barrys eyes  realizes hes
staring at a frightened child barry backs away as 
 angela sits up behind john    water rippling off
straps dangling free
john turns  locks on her black eyes

                         john

          shit 
john thinks fast  scans the area and sees every mirror
in the room has been shattered so much for the quick
fix
he jumps into the water with her grabs her face and
pushes her against the tank walls this is an exorcism
on the fly

                        john

          amar natash bow basar! rescind
          from the flesh i command thee

angelas eyes snap open  dark and dilated john sees
it  clasps a hand over her mouth  cutting off her air
supply

                           john

             back to hell asshole 
her body undulates as mammons shape tries to come through
pulsating through her arms her chest  her face
angela bites into his palm john recoils she shoves
him off and john hits the tile hard angela jumps from
the tank pushes past in a blur john spins to see
midnite standing right there  angela now firmly in his
sizetwelve grasp

                           midnite

                     to john
             finish it

intercut with





mysterious high pov

john coughs struggles to stand he tries to cover but
its obvious his end is nearing midnite positions
angela to face him braces her arms out from her sides 
crucifixionstyle she tries but cant break free john
puts a hand to her forehead 

                           john

             et separatur a plasmate tuo ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes

                           john/midnite

             rescind from the flesh i command
             thee  amar natash bow basar!
angelas body stops fighting the darkness in her eyes
and fingernails begins to fade its working
midnite is suddenly jerked backwards with an agonizing
yell angela is dropped slips into unconsciousness
john watches in horror as midnites 300pound frame is
lifted right off the floor by an invisible grasp slammed
into the ceiling then twisted and thrown with incredible
force against the floor
midnite glares at john tries to speak     but the words
die on his lips

                                                continued

enraged john scans the empty room sees a large shadow
on the ceiling that doesnt belong to any object
he holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves
and slams those tattoos together 

                           john

             into the light i command thee!
             into the light i command thee!
it takes every ounce of johns life force to keep this
spell alive and when hes about to drop from exhaustion
the shadow is brought fully into the light  becomes
that familiar shape of wings

                           voice of man os

             your ego is astounding
john strains to see the shadow become the real thing 
the majestic wings of an angel

                           john

rippling wings sliding up around her enveloping her 
pulling her in those eyes of his could melt dracula

cant even stand let alone save the girl     or humanity

bulbs flicker as current ramps down and time comes to a

complete stop

all were left with is a distant metallic drone like the
reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago
john lies in that dim halflight    motionless
something starts to swirl near him and just like that
john is no longer alone shadow falls over his pathetic
form

angela gasps  her first real breaths a strain
adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her
eyes 




ext that gorgeous sky

stretches out before us and here come those two swings
penduluming up in slow motion
young angela and isabel share that moment again but
this time isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing
her body sails up and away her fingers reaching out for
what seems so close so close
isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky

                           satan vo

             time to go

int corridor

john relaxes stops fighting the inevitable satan takes
his hand starts to pull him home but suddenly finds
himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass try
as he might he cant budge john an inch
and now johns other hand leaves his side and as if
weightless begins to rise toward something above
no sense in beating around the bush here john is in the
embrace of god
satan sees this and recoils in absolute rage 

                        satan

          the sacrifice!! no!!!!   this one

          belongs to me!!

johns rising hand drifts back down in front of satan
the middle finger fully extended final straw
satan goes rabid  turns to pure energy for a split
second his hands remain on fire

                        satan

          you will live john constantine
          you will live so youll have the
          chance to prove that your soul
          truly belongs in hell you will
          live!
satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into johns
body 
john screams in agony satan tears through his tissue 
collecting the cancer then ripping out a mass of
diseased tissue with one vengeful pull johns final
bloodcurdling scream echoes over 




int/ext ravenscar

 through every room every corridor rippling out
across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills
beyond




int corridor

on his hands and knees john takes that first breath
new lungs fill for the first time no cough not even a
wheeze face has renewed color wrists have sealed
tight

john is healed
he stands steps back inside the

john stops over the body of one sevenfoot african
warrior he stands immobilized wrecked with emotion          a
sound draws his attention to the one thing that could
cause him even greater rage 

gabriel 

is hunched over near a wall jagged cartilage stumps
protrude from his back a pattern of sinew and bone is
burned into the floor behind him its all that remains
of his once majestic wings
john approaches spots blood dripping from the former angel
he realizes what this means gets a kick out of it

gabriel looks up as john retrieves a gun from the wet
floor

             you dont deserve to be human

                           gabriel

             then pass judgment on me now
john raises the gun  puts it to gabriels forehead

                            gabriel

             do it   seek revenge   end my
             life
johns finger nudges the trigger

                           gabriel

             kill me! pull the trigger!     be
             the hand of god!
john pauses realizes whats happening here

                           john

              and ill be condemned again

                            gabriel

             do it!

                                                 continued





                                                      117

it takes everything john has not to pull that trigger
he lowers the gun shaking his head

                           john

             youre even worthless as bait
john starts to turn away 

                           gabriel

             deny your true nature today but
             what of tomorrow of the tomorrow
             after that it is only a matter
             of time before you end up right
             back where you belong it is who
             you are constantine damned
johns fist starts behind his back gains momentum the
entire arc until it ends abruptly against gabriels face
the exangel is propelled all the way to the wall 
slams hard against the concrete body crumples on
impact slides down to the muck you know this hurt like
absolute hell

                           john

             thats called pain    get used to it
john turns toward the double doors  stops cold
huddled in the doorway covered in grime is angela and
barry the experience has obviously left them both
drained
john walks across the room kneels down to them

                           angela

             thank you john
he nods beat wipes a trace of blood off her brow puts
a hand on barrys shoulder hold a beat on this gritty
family tableau




int johns apartment  midnites universal orrery

moving slowly past the inoperative device past
strangelyshaped objects of platinum and gold with names
and symbols that make a bit more sense now




ext africa  day

huge sun beats down on a lone figure walking across a
stretch of the most barren landscape on earth he stops
kneels to the heavilycracked soil starts digging




                                                       118





int johns apartment  the orrery

a hand comes in affixes an unseen object to a protruding
rod its weight causes it to drop out of frame but a
moment later it rises back into view and finds a balance




ext africa

john pulls back the protective hood from his face
healthy and tan with a new lease on life he pops a
nicorette tablet then unwraps rolls of cloth from around
the spear of destiny he drops it in the hole stares at
it a long beat




int johns apartment  the orrery

the entire mechanism shudders and now miraculously
every globe every moon every obscure object in this
miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete
sync
as it does the defining object finally slides into view
johns lighter   angela watches it rotate past nods in
approval




ext africa

john sighs finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred
relic he stands nods job done
a breeze blows past and john senses being watched he
spins and finds  nothing for a hundred miles he
starts walking

                        john vo

          some people are born to make a
          difference i had to die twice

ext 20 lanes bowling alley  angela

walking right in step something is closing in on her
a new taxi pulls up chaz is driving angela gets in

                        john vo

          god does work in mysterious ways




                                                     119





ext africa

john continues walking as something closes in on him at
incredible speed

                        john vo

          some people like it
our view rises over him and gliding across the barren
landscape are the shadow of wings

                        john vo

          some people dont




                                         fade out
