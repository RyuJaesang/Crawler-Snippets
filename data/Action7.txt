                              synopsis

     en route back to earth from a far part of the galaxy the crew of the
     starship snark intercepts a transmission in an alien language
     originating from a nearby stormshrouded planet

     mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe  they decide to land and investigate  their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
      it is dead and abandoned  inside they find among other strange
     things the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers

     certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization  beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts  lying dormant in the tomb are centuries
     old spores which are triggered into life by the mens presence  a
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the mens faces  and
     cannot be removed

     an examination by the ships medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat which is depositing
     something inside him  then it is discovered that the parasites blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal  they dare not
     kill it on the ship

     ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship
     and they blast off from the hellplanet  however before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victims body  it has been
     growing in him deposited there by the parasite and now it is loose
     on the ship

     a series of ghastly adventures follow  they trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower  it tears
     a mans head off and runs away with his body  a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm  another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature  and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the aliens
     bizarre life cycle

     finally there is only one man left alive alone on the ship with the
     creature and only six hours till his air runs out which leads to a
     climax of horrifying explosive jeopardy the outcome of which
     determines who will reach earth alive  man or alien
