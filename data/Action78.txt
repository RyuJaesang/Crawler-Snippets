        fade in

1       405 freeway  los angeles  early evening              1 

        christmas tinsel on the light poles  we are looking east past
        inglewood into the orange grid of la at night when suddenly
        we tilt up to catch the huge belly of a landing 747  the
        noise is deafening

2       int 747  passengers  same                           2 

        the usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh
        of relief that youve made it in one piece  as the plane taxis
        to its gate they stir gather personal belongings

3       on john mcclane                                        3 

        midthirties goodlooking athletic and tired from his trip
        he sits by the window  his relief on landing is subtle but
        we notice  suddenly he hears 

                                 salesmans voice
                  you dont like flying do you

        mcclane turns looks at the babbit clone next to him  caught
        he tenses holds his armrests in exaggerated fear

                                 mcclane
                  no no whered you get that idea

                                 salesman
                         smiling
                  ya wanna know the secret of successful
                  air travel  after you get where youre
                  going ya take off your shoes and socks
                  then ya walk around on the rug barefoot
                  and make fists with your toes

                                 mcclane
                  fists with your toes

                                 salesman
                  maybe its not a fist when its your
                  toesi mean like thiswork out
                  that time zone tension
                         demonstrating
                  bettern a cup of coffee and a hot
                  shower for the old jet lag  i know
                  it sounds crazy  trust me  ive
                  been doing it for nine years

        the plane stops  passengers rise start to take down overhead
        luggage  mcclane does this but as he opens the door above
        the businessman blanches seeing

3a     his pov  mcclanes baretta pistol                  3a 

        peeking out from his jacket

3b     back to scene                                          3b 

        recognizing the look mcclane smiles reassuringly

                                 mcclane
                  its okay
                         showing badge
                  im a cop
                         pause
                  trust me  ive been doing it for
                  eleven

        the businessman relaxes moves off  mcclane now wrestles down
        the biggest teddy bear fao schwartz had to offer  balancing
        this he moves down to another overhead takes out a topcoat
        and an overnighter  barely managing all this he turns
        colliding with

3c     a pretty stewardess                                    3c 

        she bumps noses with the bear gives a look

                                 stewardess
                         smiling about the bear
                  maybe you should have bought her a
                  ticket

                                 mcclane
                  her

        he scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear shrugs

                                 mcclane
                  she doesnt complain

                                 stewardess
                         eying him
                  neither would i

        mcclane smiles with just enough of a sigh to know hes as
        wistful about thingsthatmighthavebeen as she ismoves
        down the aisle

        beautiful and  on first glance  deserted  finally a
        sound in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a
        security guard hidden until now behind a massive desk
        mcclane goes there signs in

                                 mcclane
                  holly mcclane

        the guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console

                                 guard
                  just type it in there

                  off at the noise

        mcclane nods moves off  he moves to the elevators and as he
        does his experienced eye takes in

        patrolling a different area

14      int elevator  night                                  14  

        mcclane hits 30 and reacts to the hyperpowered speed with
        which he rises  he rotates his head getting out the travel
        cricks

        as he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous thumping
        throbbing noise  mcclane stops and listens before he
        realizes  its the party  as the doors open the noise
        attacks us

15      30th floor  same                                      15 

        mcclane moves around the edge of the party gradually
        spiraling inward  he grabs a glass of mimosa champagne punch
        from a passing tray sipsscowls  spotting open beers in
        an ice bucket he tosses the punch into a potted plant even
        burying the plastic glass  sipping the beer he moves through
        the dense party  people he doesnt know throw streamers over
        him

        a woman kisses him  he grins  a man kisses him

                                 mcclane
                         to himself shaking
                         his head
                  california

        finally he queries a dancing woman  the music drowns out their
        words but she nods points off in some generic direction

        mcclane heads that way cuts around a christmas tree loses
        his bearings  he sees

         they lock eyes for a moment but its an intense moment that
         says a lot about how they still feel about each other

         just then a man and a woman both a little tipsy open the
         door to the office see that its occupied and beat a hasty
         retreat  the interruption temporarily dents the mood  holly
         tries to smile  but for mcclane its the last frustration

        searching the offices on the hall one by one  they open a door
        look in from the hallway and move on quickly to the next

        mcclane looks across the corridor and sees the stairwell door
         too far to reach without being seen

        and mcclane a few minutes before now in the throes of
        passionate lovemaking on the desk  the two terrorists smile
        at each other then enter the office

        a moment later the man trying desperately to pull up his
        pants and the woman buttoning her blouse are pushed out
        into the hall and toward the larger group by fritz  the other
        terrorist franco goes to ellis office and opens the door

        suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head
        his look drops to the wall and focuses on a small red fire alarm
        switch by the door

75      int main floor  la fire station  night           75 

        an alarm sounds  quickly firemen move to their machines as a

        suddenly we see the flashing red lights of four engines in
        traffic two miles away

        mcclane stands silhouetted against the window  in the distance
        he can see another fire truck swing off santa monica onto
        avenue of the stars

        suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out then on the
        second  mcclane watches in disbelief  the trucks slow and
        turn down separate side streets heading for home

                                mcclane
                        realizing
                 son of a bitch

        just then the elevator bell rings and we hear the elevator doors
        open  a figure tony slips into the shadows  his machine
        gun drawn  we move with him from the elevator area until he
        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire
        floor  mcclane is gone

80      on mcclane                                            80  

        under a desk  he takes in his options

81      his pov                                            81  

        the feet of tony  they move slowly in his direction  mcclane
        looks down the aisle next to the windows  it leads to a series
        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path
        if he can make it past tony

82      tony                                                  82  

        he moves steadily toward the area where we saw mcclane

                                tony
                 the fire has been called off my
                 friend  no one is coming to help
                 you  you might as well come out
                 and join the others
                        fingers the trigger
                        of his machine gun
                 i promise not to hurt you

        moving more confidently he steps up to mcclanes desk then
        around it and fires a blast into the space  it is empty  as
        the sound of the machine gun fades he listens and hears another
        sound  a noise coming from the other end of the room near
        the cubicles

        tony heads toward the noise  sensing a trap he moves past
        each cubicle carefully checking each office until he reaches
        the doorway of the last one  the sound is just around the
        partition  he tenses then spins into the cubicle

        grins at his nervousness  he moves to turn it off not
        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of mcclane
        steps into frame behind him mcclane shoves his pistol barrel
        against tonys temple

                                mcclane
                 freeze policedont move or name

        calmly

                 you wont hurt me

                                mcclane
                 yeah  why not

                                tony
                        smug
                 because you are a policeman  there
                 are rules for policemen

                                mcclane
                 yeah  my captain keeps telling
                 me the same thing

        mcclane suddenly pistol whips tony across the head  tony
        reels then swallows worried for the first time

                                mcclane
                 lets go

        suddenly tony spins to the side and mcclane fires but the
        big mans momentum slams mcclane into a filing cabinet and sends
        his pistol into the hall

        tony fires his machine gun but mcclane kicks him into the desk

        he locks his arms around the big mans neck in a hold that
        sends tony reeling into the hall  mcclane holds on as they
        slam through several plastic board partitions  they careen
        across the hall into the stairwell door opening it and crash
        into

85      stairwell landing                                     85  

        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below
        for a moment both men lie still  mcclane still holding onto
        tonys neck releases it and the mans head flops sickeningly
        to the side

        for a moment mcclane just looks at the dead man  then slowly
        methodically he begins to search him  he turns all his pockets
        inside out looks at his clothing labels stares long and very
        hard at a california drivers license with tonys picture on
        it  he expertly examines the machine gun when a hissing sound
        coming from somewhere attracts his attention

        he rises moves cautiously to the source

        the struggle  mcclane stares at it formulating a plan

        pan from tonys now shoeless feet to mcclane who sits on the
        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorists
        boots on his own feet  he ties the last lace and tries to take
        a couple of steps

        he winces in pain goes off balance  quickly he starts taking
        the boots off

                                mcclane
                 a million terrorists in the world
                 and i kill the one with feet
                 smaller than my sister

        he yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage  then
        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretarys chair
        he starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to

86a    a desk                                                86a

        where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper
        then his eyes fall on some xmas decorations nearby  he smiles

        camera adjusts as mcclane pushes the buttons for the 31th and
        30th floors

        we notice hes got the dead mans machine gun and that a wooden
        desk ruler protrudes from mcclanes back pocket

        the elevator doors close and the car starts down  after its
        dropped only half a floor mcclane forces the doors open with
        his fingers  stopping the car between floors

        using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors then opens the
        outside doors of the floor above 31st with his fingers and
        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor then up onto the roof
        of the car  once on the roof of the car he reaches over the
        edge and removes the ruler closing the inside doors and setting
        the car in motion again

        camera adjusts from fritz in the bg to hans and france just
        below

        mcclane is writing in his weatherbeaten cops notebook  the

        greasecoated cables to keep his balance  already his clothes
        are soiled his face and feet arms and hair are dark from the
        dirt and sweat  the car speeds up the shaft  passing the car

        burst and mcclane ducks back stopping at the exterior door
        to the pump room he used before  it is locked from the inside

        he blows the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and
        slips into the darkness of the

        coming quickly out of the pump room mcclane picks his way
        over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door
        to the elevator shaft  the dimly lit shaft yawns before him

                 if you lock him in hell be neutralized
                  now do it!  karl  karl!

        karl turns off his radio  in the light of their flashlights
        the two other terrorists look at karl in stunned disbelief
        he opens the door to the elevator shaft

        hearing karls approach mcclane thinks fast looks down at
        his narrow confines and then at

118a   his weapon                                            118a  

        and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides

118b   back to scene                                         118b  

        quickly mcclane lets out all the slack in the sling  then
        he braces the weapon across the outside opening of the air
        shaft door and lowers himself into the

119     air shaft                                             119  

        meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent
        over it like a kid doing a halfasses skinthecat on a swing
        set

        his feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they
        reach the top of the air duct then dangle in the open space
        he straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch
        the bottom edge of the duct

        suddenly he feels something give above him and looks up

120     close on the sling                                    120  

        it was designed to carry a gun on a man not vice versa  the
        few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips
        when theyre gonehe will be too

121     karl                                                  121  

        he moves silently toward the corner

122     close  mcclanes toes                                122  

        now only inches from the bottom edge  mcclanes arms are
        fully extended now  he hears karl on the metal catwalk  his
        muscles strain and quiver

123     the sling                                             123  

        one of the canvas end slips through the clip

124     on mcclane                                            124  

        falling  he grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and
        his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing boom
        above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside
        the door

        around the corner karl freezes unsure of the sound

126     on mcclane                                            126  

        holding onto the ledge by his hands  with every ounce of
        strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct
        clawing for a hold

127     on karl                                               127  

        he rounds the corner and sees mcclanes rifle lying beneath
        the doorway  he moves to the small door shines his light and
        aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire

128     his pov                                            128  

        the shaft is deserted  moving his light around he sees the air
        duct  without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump
        room door

129     int air conditioning duct  on mcclane  same        129  

        he lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space  he
        awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and
        thumbs it on

        the flickering glow shows him this aint no place for
        claustrophobics  its a long long long dark and narrow
        corridor full of weird shadows  the far end if there even
        if one is black

                                mcclane
                 whewfor a moment there i was
                 worried

        he turns out his lighter and starts crawling

130    out                                             out   130

133a   int machine floor                                    133a  

        the three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit
        karl leading the way through the door  karl points quickly to
        the left and right where there are a series of rooms  the
        others checks these while karl approaches the camera trigger
        finger itching  almost immediately the others return

                                franco
                        a whisper
                 nothing

        karl looks puzzled  then he thinks mentally retracing mcclanes
        few options  karls eyes scan the architecture here and then
        suddenly he looks up

133b   out                                             out   133b   *

        the ceiling is crisscrossed with air ducts  he fires a      *  
        burst into the ducts

135     int air duct  same                                  135

        mcclane remains motionless in the air duct  three quartersize
        holes inches from his face show how close karl came to nailing
        him  sweat covers his face drips silently onto the aluminum

136     machine room                                          136

        karl listens patiently for sound  just then the two other
        terrorists return

                                franco
                 nothing

        karl hesitates a moment fighting his instincts before finally
        turning to go  suddenly the duct mcclane is in groans slightly
        under his weight  karl stops and looks up at the matrix of
        aluminum duct work trying to single out the source of the
        sound  he steps back into the room and raises his rifle
        holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly
        of mcclanes air duct feeling for weight  the weight of a
        body

137     inside the air duct                                   137

        mcclane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the
        aluminum fifteen feet away  there is a pause and another
        three feet closer  he can hear karls footsteps on the
        concrete  moving slowly below the duct

138     on karl                                               138  

        his eyes are fixed above him on the air duct  he presses the
        barrel up again  still nothing

139     on mcclane                                            139  

        silently he moves his hand slowly draws his beretta  the
        next indention presses up six feet away  mcclane points his
        gun downward and waits

140     karl                                                  140  

        stops directly below him  the barrel starts up and just
        touches the duct under mcclane when franco returns to the
        door and calls

                                franco
                 karl!  police!  come on

        karl hesitates then lowers his gun and leaves

141     close  mcclane                                       141

        he hears the door close and lowers his head

141a   int 33rd floor  safe room                           141a

        the large led window in the front of the safe beeps and letters
        creep by  access code accepted  we hear a clunk

        camera adjusts to show theo who grins  now his computer
        screen reads lock #1 disabled  do you wish to proceed

        theo puts goggles on his eyes holds out his hands towards
        kristoff like a doctor requesting a scalpel  kristoff gives
        him a giant drill

                                theo
                 you bet your ass im gonna proceed

        he turns on the drill

143     ext century city  avenue of the stars  night       143

        the street is empty quiet  a lone police blackandwhite
        pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow
        cruise toward the nakatomi building

144     on powell                                             144

        driving alone  he starts up at the tower  it seems calm
        its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday
        decorations on the streets  powell slows to a stop and
        scans the premises  in the lobby we see eddie sitting behind
        the desk  powell reports to his radio

                                powell
                 guard inside  no signs of disturbance
                 im going up for a closer look

        he pulls in and parks in the front

145     int machine room  same                              145  

        mcclane punches out a ceiling vent and drops down into the
        machine room  for a moment he stands listening for sounds
        of movement  the floor is quiet  he goes to the stairwell

146     ext roof  same                                      146

        the edge of the roof  suddenly a tall terrorist james
        moves along the wall and looks over at powells car

147     int 3rd floor  same                                 147

        the elevator doors open on karl franco and fritz  they      *
        step out onto the darkened floor  we see large number 3
        painted on the doors of this floor

        they move quickly toward the windows on the avenue of the stars
        side where a terrorist alexander with a bar rifle has set up
        a machine gun nest under a halfopened window  directly below
        him we see powells car

        alexander pans the police car with his weapon finger on the
        trigger  this is clearly a man hungry for action

148     30th floor hans office  same                      148  

        hans watches from above  he raises his cb

        eddie is a little startled but he moves quickly

        also hears this and his eager expression fades  but orders
        are orders

150     ext front door of nakatomi  same                    150  

        powell tries the front doors  locked  eddie comes hustling
        across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card

        mcclane goes to the windows and looks down at the street

        mcclane waits expectant  five seconds  ten seconds  but
        no commotion no shouting  he frowns

        monitor screens

                                eddie

        he makes up his mind  he lifts one of the big chairs and
        swings it at the window  the tempered glass whitens on the
        first blow

153b   ext roof                                            153b

        heinrich hears the radio and shouts to marco who grabs his
        machine gun and runs

154     int lobby                                           154

        eddie watches confidently as powell moves through the lobby
        looking for signs of trouble

154a   around the corner from powell                        154a

        mcclane draws the chair back for the final hit when a terrorist
        marco appears at the door  both men react but marco already
        has his gun up  he fires a round at mcclane  the bullets rip
        into the table top and the chair and mcclane goes down behind
        the table

156    out                                             out  156

157     int 34th floor  board room                         157

        marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table
        but finds no one  he looks around frantically than squats
        beneath the table and sees

158     mcclane                                              158

        lying prone his pistol trained on him

159     board room doorway                                   159

        just then heinrich the terrorist steps into the doorway sees
        the situation

                                heinrich
                 marco duck!

        marco dives sideways but heinrich still isnt quick enough
        mcclane fires twice and heinrich drops sprawling in the hallway
        machine gun firing blindly until he hits the floor

159a   hostage floor                                         159a

        all powell can hear here is let it snow let it snow  he
        stops just a yard from seeing the armed terrorist turns back

                                powell
                 screw this

        he turns back

        marco springs on top of the huge table  mcclane rolls on his
        back so he can cover either angle but it is clear that marco
        is in the more enviable position

        aims directly above him and fires twice into the underside
        of the table  the bullets rip through the table and marco
        who drops beside mcclane

        powell check in on his radio  unconsciously he begins to

        keeping his head low and praying he doesnt hit anything
        as the bullets follow him digging into asphalt  a half block
        away his car runs off the pavement and down a slope finally
        bouncing to a jarring halt in a parking lot which is destined
        to become police hq a few pages from now  powell sits up
        and clutches the mike

        an unmarked police car pulls up across the street from
        nakatomi building and a man in a sportcoat climbs out
        stocky his hair a little too perfect the very fact that
        he is the deputy chief of police operations on a christmas eve
        gives some evidence to his position in the pecking order  his
        name is dwayne t robinson and he moves brusquely past police
        technicians and goes to the forward group of officers

                                robinson
                 whos talking to them

                                robinson
                        puzzled
                 then who the hell have you been
                 talking too

                 killed one of the terrorists for sure
                 and claims he capped two others

                                robinson
                        exasperated
                 he claims  powell has it occured
                 to you he could be one of the
                 terrorists pulling your chain
                 or some kind of nut case who

                 lapd but definitely a badge

                                robinson
                 how do you know

                                powell
                 a hunch  things he said  like

                 powell he could be a fucking

        the camera pulls back and we see the nakatomi building rise

                 some two hours ago when an
                 unidentified party of men took over
                 the building and sealed off all of
                 its entrances and exits

                 been cut the only contact with the
                 building had been through the use of
                 cb communicators which the terrorists
                 brought with them  strangely enough
                 so far the terrorists have not
                 communicated directly with the police
                 but an unidentified man has had
                 several conversations which seem to
                 indicate

        argyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front

                        as the picture
                        stabilizes
                 of the nakatomi building
                 sources say that the terrorist
                 leader hans may be this man

                 from the organization and is operating
                 on his own

        ellis looks at hans and shrugs well i tried hans nods
        understandingly  he takes the cb presses the talk button and
        in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the walther up to
        ellis forehead and pulls the trigger

                                mcclane
                        calling out
                 al  al you here  

        the crowd eddys and surgessuddenly powell is there and
        mcclane knows its him  they stare at each other ten feet
        apart and then theyre grinning extending their hands  but
        somehow a shake isnt enough and theyre embracing each other
        like men whove lived through combat togetherwhich in fact
        is the truth

                                mcclane
                        emotional
                 al  man you were my rock  i
                 couldnt have made it without you

                                powell

                 holly gennero

                                holly
                        taking powells hand
                        correcting
                 holly mcclane

        hearing this mcclane grins pulls her close                 *

                                powell
                        to her
                 a pleasure  i guess john doesnt
                 need me to give you that message
                 anymore

                                holly
                        puzzled
                 message

        mcclane begins to make silent ixney gestures in powells
        direction

                                powell
                 you know about him being such a
                 jerk  and how hes really sor 
                        seeing mcclane
                  eeuh im sure hell fill
                 you in

        just then robinson barges forward

                                robinson
                 i want you for debrief mcclane
                 youve got some things to answer
                 for  ellis murder  property
                 damage  interfering with police                    *
                 business 

        a scream causes mcclane to turn

400     his pov                                            400

        there in the doorway is karl clothing and body scorched
        easily as crusted in dirt and blood as mcclane he holds his
        machine gun

401     ext building                                         401

        as the crowd panics trying to escape karl locks eyes with
        mcclane and levels his gun  mcclane throws holly to the
        ground and grabs the dumbstruck robinsons sidearm

        but he doesnt get off a shot  a lone gunshot stops karl 
        knocking him back through the doorway  mcclane looks back to
        see powell still sighting down the barrel of his 38

        his hand is rock steady  he sees mcclanes look

                                powell
                        shrugging
                 you were right  you couldnt have
                 made it without me

        they smile  suddenly mcclane and holly squint as lights pan
        onto them  thornburg pushes his way forward mike extended
        like a weapon

                                thornburg
                 mr mcclanemrs mcclaneany

                 what are your feelings now that its
                 all over

        without a beat holly punches him in the chops  he falls
        dropping the mike with an electronic squeal  mcclane looks at
        his wife amazed  behind them thornburg sits on the ground *
        nurses his lip turns to his camerman

                                thornburg
                        eager                                       *
                 did you get that

        mcclane and holly continue on turn towards                  *

402     argyles limo                                         402

        its a little smashed up but still running  argyle is
        standing beside the open door  mcclane and holly get in and
        argyle closes the door

                                argyle
                        getting in the
                        front
                 if this is their idea of christmas
                 i gotta be there for new years

        camera adjusts to show the read window where mcclane and
        holly are kissing  as they drive off we

                                                    fade out

                             the end
