              hello i grew up in pakistan and people
              are always asking me what was that like
              really not that different from here i
              mean we played cricket which is just a
              spicier version of baseball and we
              prayed a lot well not a lot just five
              times a day and we marry someone our
              parents find for us arranged marriage
              you know for me it was probably that we
              got episodes of the ateam a little bit
              later and by a little bit later i mean
              we just got episode two but other than
              that it was exactly the same

                           kumail
              um my name is kumail

                           emily
              yeah we know

                           jessie
              we saw you perform

                           kumail
              yeah now that the niceties are out of
              the way i have to tell you that when
              you yelled at me it threw me off you
              really shouldnt heckle comedians its
              so rude

                           emily
              i didnt heckle you i just woohooed
              you it was supportive

                           kumail
              okay thats a common misconception
              yelling anything at a comedian is
              considered heckling heckling doesnt
              have to be negative

                           emily

              bed that would be a heckle

                  kumail
     so maybe ill run into you at the club
     sometime and we can grab a drink

                  emily
     im not really  i know this sounds
     like a line  but im not really dating
     right now i have a lot of school and
     work and just a lot on my plate

                  kumail
     thats perfect because im not really
     dating right now either i actually
     have a pretty strict twoday rule where
     i cant see someone more than two days
     in a row so since we hung out for two
     days if i were to see you again which
     i wont because youre not dating im
     not dating i wouldnt be able to see
     you until monday

                  emily
     we havent hung out for two days weve
     hung out for about five hours just to
     like be totally clear

                  kumail
     yesterday and today cause its after
     midnight today is actually tomorrow
     earlier tonight was yesterday so two
     days

                  emily
     you see i dont date time nerds so that
     really takes you off the table

                  kumail
     that works out because i am a hard
     core time nerd

                  emily
     yeah i can tell

                  kumail
     im like very strict about am/pm
     stuff

                  emily
     so wait just to establish what did we
     just decide

                  kumail
     we decided we arent ever going to see
     each other again

                  emily
     um because i was pretty unhappy in my
     first marriage and i drank a lot and
     one way to cover drinking is to know a
     lot about wine

                  kumail
     im sorry wait what did you say

                  emily

                  better

     the doctor walks in

                              dr cunningham
                  hello

     beth and terry stand to greet her

                  please sit im dr cunningham emilys
                  attending ill be coordinating all the
                  doctors and orchestrating her treatment
                  strategy

                               beth
                  all the doctors how many are there

                              dr cunningham
                  five

                               beth
                  five why so many is that normal

                               dr cunningham
                  yes its standard with patients in the
                  icu we come at it from different
                  angles
50


     when we cut back it is a different person now dr
     lewin terry kumail and beth stay but the doctors
     change

                            dr lewin
               we immediately initiated orotracheal
               intubation thankfully it hasnt affected
               her heart at this point

                                                         cut to

                            dr whelan
               we dont know the exact nature of the
               infection yet but weve got her on a
               broad spectrum of antibiotics

                                                         cut to

                            dr platt
               critical infections centering around
               the costodiaphragmatic

                                                         cut to

                            dr spellman
               our theory is methicillinresistant
               staphylococcus aureus

                            terry
                     taking notes
               hold on is staphylococcus with an f
               or a ph

                            dr spellman
               ph

     montage of doctors babbling unintelligibly as beth and
     terry visibly panic



     int waiting room moments later

     terry beth and kumail sit surrounded by kids with
     coloring books adults with magazines various chargers
     plugged into the wall these are the people who wait

                            kumail
               that was very reassuring wasnt it
               apparently there are good and bad
               comas and the kind that they put her
               in the medically induced ones are
               definitely the good kind of coma
                            more
51

                            kumail contd
               like you know how there are good and
               bad carbs gremlins those can be good
               or bad

                            terry

               at the airport you quit comedy and never
               did comedy ever again

                            chris

                            cj

               wouldnt have to look at your face or
               hear your words

     kumail interjects

                            kumail

                            chris
               he put his girlfriend in a coma you
               know the way you do

                            mary
               he signed a paper that allowed doctors to
               put her

                            cj
               he suggested it

                            kumail
               shes gonna be fine shes gonna be fine
               they said shes gonna be fine doctors
               know medical stuff thats what doctors

               is a medically induced coma this is
               their specialty

                            mary
               maybe

                            chris
               it might be a good thing she might wake
               up with a new skill like my cousin
               blacked out once and when he came to he
               thought he knew a different language

                            cj
               did he

                            chris
               no it was just gibberish that he made
               up it was brain damage

     cj and mary shake their heads kumail looks freaked out

               awake theres no need to do it when
               shes unconscious

                            kumail
               its more complicated than that

                            beth
               is it because i know about the twoday
               rule i know about the headshots and the

               im just gonna stay for a second is this
               seat 

     kumail gestures to the empty seat next to beth but she
     throws her sewing on it and turns away

     kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down
     facing emilys parents beth watches him intensely for a
     few beats before kumail turns to the woman sitting next
     to him

                            kumail contd
               is that lady still looking at me



     int hospital cafeteria later

     kumail carries his tray spots terry and beth together
     having a hushed conversation he sits at a different
     table terry waves at him kumail heads over to them

               its called thoracentesis its a very
               common procedure were going to go in
               between the ribs and remove the

               to relax

               they couldnt find out what the disease
               was or where the virus came from or
               the bacteria or whatever

                            kumail
               but they took out the infection so it
               shouldnt matter

                            terry
               i know thats what i said but her
               vitals didnt normalize and now they
               say that the infection is continuing to
               spread its in her kidneys

                            kumail
               but the kidneys are so far from the
               lungs

                            terry
               i know its an aggressive infection
               and they said what they gotta do now is
               figure out what this mystery disease
               actually is

                            beth

               process of elimination

               northwesterns #1 and its not because

               still hadnt gone down even after
               several days in bed which is strange
               stills disease is when the body thinks
               healthy tissue is an infection so it
               tries to fight it its like a big
               biological misunderstanding

                             terry
               yeah yeah

                            dr cunningham

               stabilized within hours shes gonna
               take time to recover but shell be
               fine

               living condition is a potential health
               risk and youre not that funny but
               youre probably not suited to do
               anything else either so thats
               troublesome

                            kumail
               you really made it sound like you were
               going to say something positive there

                            terry
               i guess i did didnt i you know i

                            kumail
               so you gonna hang around chicago for a
               while

               have your daughter go through physical
               therapy
                      beat
               its so strange that we could go
               through one of the most intense
               experiences of our lives together and
               just never see each other again

                pictures of the pakistani women i
                thought this was a good idea but it
                feels a little stupid

      kumail puts the items down and kneels before emily

                through this experience but you have
                to understand that all that happened
                while i was asleep like you felt one
                way a few weeks ago and now youre
                saying you feel the total opposite way
                and the only thing thats changed is
                that i was in a coma honestly i look
                at all of this and i just think i
                cant do it again i cant be the
                reason that you dont have a family it
                just feels totally different now and i
                cant do that again do you understand

                             kumail

                wont let you kick me out of the
                family since i am a member of the
                family it would stand to reason that i
                would get a vote in whether or not i
                get kicked out and that vote would
                have to be unanimous standard
                parliamentary procedure so all those
                in favor of not kicking kumail out of
                the family raise your hand

      kumail raises his hand everyone else stares silently

                okay youre giving me the silent
                treatment i figured that was what was
                going to happen i have a solution

                i admit this one is designed to stir up
                some controversy its interesting how
                you cant really kick someone out of your
                family because theyll always be your
                family i agree with that one its a
                good one so im gonna leave these here

                             kumail
                so the first time i came to america i
                was fourteen and i was just visiting my
                uncle in new york and it just happened
                to be thanksgiving on my first day in
                america my uncle took me to the macys
                thanksgiving day parade and i was like
                this is every day in america! as
                advertised every day they have a party
                celebrating garfield no day has lived
                up to that day so i was lying to my
                parents i was telling them i was gonna
                be a lawyer and theyre very
                disappointed cause they wanted me to be
                a doctor and you guys are like why
                didnt you just tell them that you
                wanted to be a doctor
                             more
113

                            kumail contd
               its a lie anyway and im like well it
               has to be believable if i told them i
               want to be a doctor theyd be like
               bullshit if i say lawyer theyre
               like oh ok thats something cause
               theres a strict hierarchy doctor
               engineer lawyer hundreds of jobs
               isis then comedian

      a very loud whooooo emanates from the crowd kumail
      looks out to the crowd to see emily beaming at him he
      is taken aback

                            kumail contd
                     stumbling
