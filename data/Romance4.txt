rocket catapult failed and dr lizardo got sucked half in half 
outwhen they hauled him back he wasnt the same guy  his hair was

wearing glasses practically fill their cups with cubes of sugarone 
of their arms elongating 1 for more sugarthe strange move 
unnoticed

enter penny priddy beside himthe glamorous couple surrounded by the 
hong kong cavaliers

john oconnor and john gomez those two nearsighted redheads with the 
sweet coffee applauding only politely

	143
buckaroo taking penny onto the dais with him the cavaliers assuming 
positions of security as

buckaroo sits next to professor hikita who shields his remarks from 
what must be easily fifty microphones

prof hikita
rawhide tells me dr lizardo escaped

buckaroo banzai
nodding
im assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock 
just in case

professor hikita removing the oscillation overthruster from his 
battered briefcase and laying it on the table  buckaroo taking a sip 
of water

secretary of defense
thank you for coming  before i answer any questions i think buckaroo 
owes us all a few explanations for yesterdays antics

buckaroo banzai
mr secretarysenator cunningham ladies and gentlementhirty years 
ago nearly to this day my mother and father and sir alan motley all 
former colleagues of professor toichi hikita at the texas school of 
mines gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane 
notion the possibility of contacting alien life not on another 
planet but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid 
matterlife which before the war professor hikita had actually 
glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with 
doctor emilio lizardo

1st reporter
the same doctor lizardo that just

prof hikita
one and the same

	144
someone elses nearsighted pov peering at the back of professor 
hikitas head through a crack in the curtains behind the dais

	145
john oconnor and john gomez at the refreshment table now adding 
several packs of sweet n low to their thick coffee as

on the dais	146

buckaroo banzai
i dont wanna go get too technical here ladies and gentlemen but im 
talking twister physics  quantum mechanics  now you see now you 
dont  this table im sitting behind  it appears to be solid matter 
right

buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass dropping 
it splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces 
off the table

buckaroo banzai
but in point of fact the solid parts of this table the protons 
quarks your neutrons and electronsthey comprise only about one 
quadrillionth of its total volume

secretary of defense
which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into

buckaroo banzai
exactly  so the professor here way back in 1937 figured that if 
solid matter is mostly empty space a person oughta be able to discover 
a to travel inside things like tables  and mountains

prof hikita
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way an alternating 
gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its 
electroweak forces!

buckaroo banzai
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part right 
professor

2nd reporter
what about the pentagon  the possibility of war in the eighth 
dimension mr secretary

penny priddy
hey better there than here huh

some applause the secretary of defense eyeing penny critically as the 
lights dimas radar shield one slips into the room approaches the 
dais and the first slide is projected onto the screen

	147
the image a murky onebut the outline of a warship with us 
sailors aboard nonetheless unmistakable

close on	148

a whisper
the presidents calling you buckaroo

buckaroo banzai
the president of what

radar shield one
the president of the united states

	149
another slide even more graphic the number on the bow of the ship 
plainly visible7541

everyone captivated	150

buckaroo banzai
is he still delirious

radar shield one
shrugging
cant tell its real fuzzy i patched him through to a pay phone down 
the hall

prof hikita
in 1942 a us navy frigate number 7541 disappeared on a clear day 
in the north atlantic long thought to have been torpedoed these 
pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the eighth dimension

secretary of defense
now wait a minute here

prof hikita
next transparency please

a loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector 
proves to be a remarkable image

of an upside down seventeenth century pirate vessel	151

buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by penny	152

penny priddy
buckaroo dont forget your thruster

handing him the oscillation overthrusterbuckaroo declining it

buckaroo banzai

more noises the sound of telephone switching equipment

int  corridor  afternoon	155

back at a pay phone in the corridor buckaroo trying to figure out why 
the president doesnt answer 

radar shield one
seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus  but they used the 
code

buckaroo banzai
mr president  some kind of interferencei cant

nothing from the other end except odd sounding computer beeps and the 
staticladen voices of several operators

rawhide
maybe its just a prankster some computer whiz kid

reno
whoever it was they used the blue code alpha clearance

buckaroo banzai
to radar shield one
go back to the bus and reroute the call

rawhide
and try the presidents private number at the hospital  make sure this 
is on the level were busy people here

	156
when suddenly eerie inexplicable things begin to occurall having 
to do with electricitythe telephone book scooting closer to 
buckaroos fingers as if drawn by a magnet the pages then turning 
faster and faster

	157
buckaroo amazednow the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming 
shut the phone simultaneously emitting a bizarre buzz

	158
and then buckaroo gets literally the shock of his lifea mighty 
electrical current passing through the telephone

and hurling him out into the cooridor!	159

buckaroo banzai
pencil!  quick!  pen!  anything!

reno complying the lights returning to normal buckaroo dazed his 
hand moving automatically writing on any surface available

a spark flying when he touches the metaltipped pen to metal!	160

buckaroo finally settling for his hand scribbling numbers on his palm
	161

int  conference room  afternoon	162

prof hikita
let me ask you to imagine the oscillation overthruster as a 
sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a 
targetin this case a mountainand the jet car as a giant super
conducting magnet

the secretary of defense fascinated	163

secretary of defense
sure sure but what about the fourth fifth sixth and seventh 
dimensions

penny priddy
thumbing through her paperback
i dont guess they matter  its like cheesecloth i think  minkowiski

as all eyes turn to see a still woozy buckaroo banzai returning 
pointing dramatically at john gomez and john oconnor in the 
audience

buckaroo banzai

buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room those two astonished 
red aliens racing for the nearest exit!

	167
the hong kong cavaliers rushing to help buckaroo when suddenly the 
piercing scream of penny priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and 
look toward the dais

where yet nother redhead called john bigbooté in glasses and dark 
suit a bandanna over his face has just stepped from behind the 
curtain and seized professor hikita pointing a revolver at the old 
mans headthe cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais 
outraged

john bigbooté
okay wise guys! 

the masked john bigbooté firing once wounding reno in the 
shoulder

john bigbooté
let those gun belts hit the floor! and nobody follows or the prof is 
history! 

the pistol stuck in professor hikitas ear convincing the cavaliers to 
obey to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the 
curtain and out of sightas new jersey administers first aid to reno 
and penny strokes the fallen cavaliers hair berating the idle 
bystanders around them

penny priddy
is this the kind of society you want  a society of weakkneed 
jellyfish wallowing in selfpity prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us 
off like flies

senator cunningham
or a society where we stand strong take charge of our own destiny 
with the cry so far and no farther will we be pushed!
