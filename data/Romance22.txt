	they are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now the barking of the dog segues into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds tweeting twittering cawing as melanie 
	and mrs macgruder go to the counter at the far end  there 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room and the walls 
	are lined with wiremesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds contained 
	birds to be sure the birds are quite beautiful mostly exotic 
	birds small splashes of color behind the wiremesh cages 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages as they walk

	with the pencil there is no menace in the birds surrounding

	bars and mesh of their cages off screen the puppy begins 
	barking again as the front door opens melanie looks up

	the birds are startled into scarlet flight

	two shot  melanie and mitch

	as they pass each other in the aisle he gives a polite little 
	nod and she gives a polite little smile but as he passes

	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner

	med shot  melanie

	looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with mitch again

				mitch

		thank you

				annie
			sitting opposite her
		it gets a little chilly here at night

	melanie nods and sips at the brandy there is a long pause

				annie
		well howd your evening go

	melanie shrugs

				annie
		did you meet lydia

	melanie nods

				annie
		or would you rather i changed the 
		subject

				melanie
			with a tired smile
		i think so

				annie
			nodding
		how do you like our little hamlet

				melanie
		i despise it

				annie
			laughing
		well i dont suppose it offers much 
		to the casual visitor unless youre 
		thrilled by a collection of shacks 
		on a hillside it takes a while to 
		get used to

				melanie
		where are you from originally annie

				annie
		san francisco

				melanie
		howd you happen to come here

				annie
		oh someone invited me up for the 
		weekend a long time ago

	there is an awkward pause annie shrugs

				annie
		look i see no reason for being coy 
		about this it was mitch brenner

	melanie nods

				annie
		i guess you knew that anyway

				melanie
		i suspected as much

				annie
		you neednt worry its over and 
		done with a long time ago

				melanie
		annie  theres nothing between 
		mitch and me

				annie
		isnt there
			she shrugs
		maybe there isnt maybe theres 
		never anything between mitch and any 
		girl

				melanie
		what do you mean

				annie
		i think ill have some of that too
			she pours brandy 
			drinks sighs
		i was seeing quite a lot of him in 
		san francisco you know
			she smiles weakly
		and then one weekend he asked me 
		up to meet lydia

				melanie
		when was this

				annie
		four years ago of course that was 
		shortly after his father died  things 
		may be different now

				melanie
		different

				annie
		with lydia
			pause
		did she seem a trifle distant

				melanie
			smiling
		a trifle

				annie
		then maybe it isnt different at 
		all you know her attitude nearly 
		drove me crazy i simply couldnt 
		understand it

				annie
		when i got back to san francisco i 
		spent days trying to figure out just 
		what id done to displease her

				melanie
		and what had you done

				annie
		nothing! i simply existed so what 
		was the answer a jealous woman 
		right a clinging possessive mother
			she shakes her head
		wrong with all due respect to 
		oedipus i dont think that was the 
		case at all

				melanie
		then what was it

				annie
		lydia liked me you see that was 
		the strange part of it in fact now 
		that im no longer a threat were 
		very good friends

				melanie
		then why did she object to you

				annie
		because she was afraid

				melanie
		afraid youd take mitch

				annie
		afraid id give mitch

				melanie
		i dont understand

				annie
		afraid of any woman whod give mitch 
		the only thing lydia can give him 
		love

				melanie
		annie that adds up to a jealous 
		possessive woman

				annie
		no i dont think so shes not afraid 
		of losing her son you see  shes 
		only afraid of being abandoned

				melanie
		someone ought to tell her shed be 
		gaining a daughter

				annie
		she already has a daughter

				melanie
		what about mitch didnt he have 
		anything to say about this

				annie
			apologetically
		i can understand his position he 
		went through a lot with lydia after 
		his father died he didnt want to 
		risk going through it all over again

				melanie
		i see

				annie
		so it ended not immediately of 
		course i went back to san francisco 
		and i still saw mitch every now and 
		then but we both knew it was 
		finished

				melanie
		then what are you doing here in bodega 
		bay

				annie
		you get straight to the point dont 
		you

				melanie
		im sorry forgive me

				annie
		no thats all right i dont mind  
		i came up here for two reasons to 
		begin with i was bored with my job 
		in san francisco i was teaching at 
		a private school there well you 
		know you probably went to one 
		yourself

				melanie
		i did

				annie
		then you know little girls in brown 
		beanies deadly here i have a life 
		ill go into that classroom on monday 
		morning and ill look out at twenty
		five upturned little faces and each 
		of them will be saying yes please 
		give me what you have
			pause
		and ill give them what i have i 
		havent got very much but ill give 
		them every ounce of it to me thats 
		very important it makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time
			she sighs
		thats the first reason

				melanie
		and the second

				annie
			simply
		i wanted to be near mitch
			pause
		it was over and i knew it but i 
		wanted to be near him anyway
			she smiles
		you see i still like him a hell of 
		a lot thats rare i think i dont 
		want to lose his friendship ever

	there is a moment of silence into the silence the telephone

	melanie rises and goes to the phone the camera follows annie 
	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following recording her reactions as melanie 
	talks to mitch in the background

	annie is not devastated by this call and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing mitch to another girl

				melanie
			at phone coolly
		hello yes this is melanie fine 
		thank you no no trouble at all  i 
		simply followed the road its a

	startling them both

				annie
			rising
		who can that be at this hour

	melanie goes to stand beside annie puzzled annie unlocks

		for the travelers aid at the 
		airport

				mitch
		helping travelers

				melanie
		yes

	she hesitates for a moment thinking she has never really 
	considered before what she does with her time and now that 
	she is accounting for it it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant

				melanie
		and on tuesdays i take a course in 
		general semantics at berkeley  thats 
		not a job of course i just take it 
		because

				mitch
		what about thursdays and fridays

	she leans over and whispers in his ear they both burst out 
	laughter but then suddenly a very serious look comes into 
	melanies face

	close shot  melanie

				melanie
		thats silly isnt it  teaching a

	full shot  melanie and mitch

	as she moves abruptly away from him and starts toward where 
	the children have begun playing blind mans bluff mitch 
	stares after her for a moment moved by this sudden glimpse 
	of character and then follows her down the dune the children 
	are all in a circle annie is busy changing the blindfold 
	from michele to cathy

	camera pans  melanie and mitch

	the camera is now on the lawn pointing up toward dunes we 
	see mitch and melanie descending they are coming down by 
	way of a short cut and are not on the zigzag path as they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes they are absorbed in each other the camera pans 
	off them and bring into the picture annie surrounded by the 
	children she is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	michele to cathy she hands michele her glasses back  during 
	this and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of cathy she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching mitch and melanie

	camera moves a little to her left camera right at this 
	moment in the background lydia is emerging with the birthday 
	cake the candles on it are unlit lydia immediately also 
	catches sight of mitch and melanie and she slows up somewhat 
	as she walks to the long table her eyes still on the couple 
	during this we see annie in the foreground sending cathy 
	off

				annie
		all right then here we go
			she spins her
		once!
			she spins her again
		twice!
			she spins her again
		three! go get em cathy!

	she says all this while still looking toward the couple she 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face she twists completely around to look at lydia as 
	though she were wondering if lydia sees what she sees

	mitch grins

				melanie
		it all started several months ago 
		with a peasant sparrow up in the

		telling all the other sparrows that 
		human beings werent fit to rule 
		this planet preaching wherever anyone 
		would listen

				mitch
		growing a beard

				melanie
			delighted
		yes of course he had to have a 
		beard! birds of the world unite! 
		he kept saying over and over

				mitch
		so they united

				melanie
		not at first oh yes a few sparrows 
		out for kicks

				mitch
		well theyll go along with anything

				melanie
		sure but eventually even the more 
		seriousminded birds began to listen  
		why should humans rule they asked
		 themselves

				mitch
		hear!

				melanie
		why should we submit ourselves to 
		their domination

				mitch
		hear hear!

				melanie
		and all the while that sparrow was 
		getting in his little messages  
		birds of the world unite!

				mitch
		take wing!

		wherever they can get it

				melanie

				mrs bundy

		birds

				salesman
		yeah birds all they do is make a 
		mess of everything who needs them

				mrs bundy
		we need them

				salesman
		not if theyre starting a war

				mrs bundy
		they are incapable of organized

				melanie

				mrs bundy
		i have seen jays doing everything it 
		is conceivable for jays to do  
		ornithology happens to be my 
		avocation miss daniels youre 
		talking about preservation of the 
		species a hen protecting her young  
		theres a vast difference between

				melanie
		maybe theyre all protecting the 
		species maybe theyre tired of being 
		shot at and roasted in ovens and

				mrs bundy
		are you discussing gamebirds now  
		all birds are not gamebirds you 
		know

				melanie
		i dont know anything about birds 
		except that theyre attacking this 
		town

				salesman
		then fight back get yourselves guns 
		and wipe them off the face of the 
		earth

				mrs bundy
		that would hardly be possible

				deke
		why not mrs bundy

				mrs bundy
		because there are 8650 species of 
		birds in the world today mr carter 
		its estimated that five billion 
		seven hundred and fifty million birds 
		live in the united states alone the 
		five continents of the world

				sholes

			his mind
		actually those gulls must have been 
		after the fish

				mrs bundy
		of course

				sholes
		makes a lot more sense than well 
		an attack

				mrs bundy
		of course it does if we believe 
		that birds are attacking why why 
		next well believe that grasshoppers 
		and cockroaches are capable of

				mitch
			sighing
		were going to need more wood for

				announcer
			continuing as drone

		the goal of a peaceful world of free

		transcending the hates and fears 
		that rend our age  we will not reach 
		that goal today or tomorrow  we may 
		not reach it in our lifetime  but 
		the quest is the great adventure of 
		our century  we sometimes chafe at 
		the burdens of our obligations the 
		complexity of our decisions the 
		agony of our choices but there is 
		no comfort or security for us in 
		evasion no solution in abdication 
		no relief in irresponsibility
			pause

		of you in the congress and of me as

		we did not start in a world we did 
		not make but the pressures of life
