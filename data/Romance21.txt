     we hear a clock ticking

                                                      fade in

1    int riggans dressing room  theater  day                  1
     close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug the
     center of what seems to be a makeshift meditation space

     we slowly tilt up to discover the back of riggan thomson 55
     he is in the proper lotus position dressed only in tight
     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply and if all
     this seems a little odd it becomes all the more so when you
     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor
     his breath is calm and measured in and out in and out

                         man vo
               how did we end up here
                   beat
               this place is a fucking dump

     we begin to slowly move toward riggans back while his measure
     breathing continues we see a clock on the wall ticking

                         man vo
               smells like balls

     a slight twitch in riggans neck

                         man vo
               we dont belong in this shithole

     a skype call shatters the silence close on his back we follow
     riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call
     on the computer screen appears sam 21 in a pair of levis
     and a led zeppelin tshirt she has simple and striking good
     looks with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes she
     stands in a korean deli among the flowers talking to riggan
     through her iphone

1a                                                                1a

     the korean store owner 50 stands in the background screaming
     at her the whole time

                         riggan
               sam i cant



                                                       continued

              wanted

                        riggan
              alchemillas or something soothing that
              smells nice listen i cant
                        sam
              it all smells like fucking kimchi!

                        riggan
              then whatever looks nice anything but
              roses no roses

                        korean
              flowers dont need you touch! they need you
              buy!!!

                        sam
                  close into the screen
              i hate this job

    and the skype call is over riggan closes the laptop and leans
    forward trying to regain his calm his reflection appears in
    the mirror and for the first time we see his face he has a
    dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant there is a
    piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase a
    thing is a thing not what it is said of that thing

                        annie on speakers
              riggan theyre starting scene
              five we need you on stage

                        riggan
              shit
    riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks he
    hurries out

    through the narrow corridors of the theater there is a lot
    of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
    disappear carrying equipment and scenery as riggan descends the
    stairs a stage hand· passes by in the opposite direction

                        stage hand·

    riggan continues on until he arrives backstage he runs into
    jake 42 his producer and friend

                        jake
              hows it going buddy

    the stage suddenly we are in the midst of an americana style
    kitchen

    around the kitchen table sit lesley 35 plain and no nonsense
    her simple hairstyle and makeup cant hide how attractive she
    is laura 35 dark exotic the kind of woman who makes every
    person she meets feel like shes seducing them and ralph 40
    slightly handsome slightly balding slightly invisible

    a half empty bottle of gin on the table they drink from
    highball glasses as they chat

                        lesley
              he loved me

                        ralph
              yeah he loved her so much he tried
              to kill her

                        laura
              he tried to kill you

                        lesley

              beat me up one night he dragged me
              around the living room by my
              ankles yelling i love you i love
                        more
                                                       continued

                    lesley contd

          love like that

                    ralph
          how is that that is not love and you know
          it why do you insist on calling it

                    lesley

          it was
                    ralph
          what about you nick does that sound like
          love to you

riggan arrives at the table and sits

                    riggan

          know the man ive only heard his name
          mentioned in passing youd have to
          know the particulars but i think what
          youre saying is that love is absolute

                    ralph
          yeah the kind of love im talking about
          is the kind of love im talking about
          you dont try and kill people

                    lesley
              sadly
          it was love mel to eddie it was i dont
          care what anybody says he was ready to die
          for it

                    ralph
          ask her what he did after she left him

                    lesley
          he shot himself in the mouth but he
          screwed that up too poor ed

                    ralph
          poor ed my ass the guy was dangerous

                     laura
          howd he screw it up if he shot himself in

          he used to carry this twentytwo we lived
          like fugitives those days i never knew
                                                    continued

                    riggan
              breaking character to direct
               exasperated
          okay fugitives are on the run ralph how
          many times do i have to fugitives are
          scared give me more of that

ralph nods he takes a breath and dives in once again

                    ralph
              the same but louder
          we lived like fugitives those days

extremely frustrated riggan stares out into the auditorium
from his pov we see jake who is now sitting in the third row
his head buried in his hands tortured by ralphs performance
riggan turns back to ralph

                    ralph contd
          i never knew if he was going to come out
          of the bushes or from behind a car and just
          start shooting

riggan watches ralph act and sees his whole production headed
down the drain ralph is just that bad

                    ralph contd
          the man was crazy he was capable of
          anything

the actors all wait for a cue from riggan who is now staring
up into the lights above the stage laura finally picks up
riggans cue

                    laura
          christ what a nightmare

                    ralph
          he used to call me at the hospital and
          say
              over the top
          son of a bitch your days are numbered

silence ralph looks over to riggan

                    ralph contd
          too much little bit i just wanted to give
          you a range so you could

and with that a light comes barreling down from its perch and
crashes into ralphs head making him hit the floor like a rag
doll silence

                       laura
          holy shit
                                                    continued

sight of a poster from a movie called birdman 3 the
superhero birdman a younger riggan in a bird costume wings
widely spread stares directly back at him a hand written
note on the top of the poster reads thomson break a wing!
from the boys at local 1 riggan tries to calm himself with a
mantra

                                                    continued
                                                  10/29/14     /   11

                         laura
               so far no fun

     riggan closes the door and looks at the birdman poster

                         birdman vo
               fun you know what would be fun getting
               the fuck out of here before we humiliate
               ourselves that would be fun

     riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at
     his hair as it comes off his head we discover it was a wig
     he turns away from the mirror trying desperately to stay
     calm something catches his eye a vase of roses on the end
     of the table a card in them says they didnt have the
     whatever you wanted  sam enraged riggan focuses on the
     vase it begins to shift then with a surge of anger
     without ever touching it he sends it crashing against the
     wall on the other side of the room

     the camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor it
     hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room
     until it finally settles on riggan now dressed in a casual
     blazer

a5                                                                 a5

     it is later the same day he is sitting on the sofa and on three
     chairs in front of him are three journalists

     gabriel a geeky theatre journalist wearing thick glasses and
     a thin tie clara a reporter from an entertainment blog and
     han a polite obese japanese journalist who sits next to his
     translator another japanese guy

                         gabriel
               why does somebody go from playing the lead
               in a comic book franchise to adapting
               raymond carver for the stage

     riggan tries to remain calm

                         gabriel contd
               i mean as youre probably aware barthes
               said the cultural work done in the past
               by gods and epic sagas is now done by
               laundry detergent commercials and comic
               strip characters its a big leap youve
               taken

     riggan shifts nervously
                                                          continued
                                                10/29/14   /   12

                    riggan

                    gabriel

          youre doing this play to battle the
          impression that youre a washedup super
          hero

          until you feel comfortable

                    mike

riggan tries to hide his excitement he grabs the script from a
nearby table and walks it over to mike

                    riggan
          take a look at page twenty

                    mike

riggan drops the script and begins the scene

                    riggan
          im the wrong person to ask i didnt
          know the man ive only heard his name

          youd have to know the particulars but
          i think what youre saying is that love
          is absolute

mike stares at riggan hyperfocused

                    mike
              ruminating

    she turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression

                        sam
              dude seriously

    moving by her into a dressing room

              this is the theatre honey dont be so
              selfconscious

mike takes off his shirt and hands it to sam she doesnt budge
and it hits the floor he begins to unbutton his pants

                    mike
          you gonna stand there

                    sam
              glancing at her cell

          holy what is happening where are
          your underpants

                    mike
          at home under the bed i think

sam glances at mike for a second then returns to her phone
larry begins to help mike into some pants which given the
situation is very awkward

                    larry
          okay everything is too small

                    sam

lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a
naked mike she doesnt notice sam who is partially hidden by a
clothes rack she just goes about trying a costume shirt
                    lesley

     see the stagehands ready to do their jobs we can feel the
     electricity of a first preview

     on stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible annie
     stands at her podium calling the cues for the show

ice and a bottle of gin he goes to the opposite side of the
stage and takes his place in the wings he peeks out at the
audience who seem to be watching with interest

then we pan to the stage to find mike lesley and laura
performing the scene we saw at the beginning around the table
mike looks comfortable sipping at his drink a half empty
bottle of gin on the table

                    mike
          the maniac shot himself right in front of
          us i rode with him in the ambulance to the

          right before he did it his eyes they
          were so sad lonely

                    laura
          did you have to treat him

                    mike

              pouring another drink

          up to like twice the size of a normal
          head id never seen anything like
          it and i swear to god i hope i
          never do again

          see her through the eye holes can you
          imagine im telling you the mans heart
          was breaking because he couldnt turn his

                     riggan
              startled

painful silence

disappears into his dressing room riggan begins walking
again we follow him into

          remember why we broke up
silence then as if he hasnt heard what she said

                    riggan
          the last time i flew here from la george
          clooney was sitting two seats in front of
          me with those cuff links and that
          chin we ended up flying through this
          really bad storm the plane started to
          rattle and shake and everyone on board
          was crying and praying and i just sat
          there sat there thinking that when sam
          opened that paper it was going to be
          clooneys face on the front page not
          mine a beat did you know that farrah

                    sylvia

                    sylvia contd
          and one hour later you were
          telling me how much you loved me

          ridiculous comedy you did with goldie
          hawn didnt mean i did not love you
          but thats what you always do you
          confuse love with admiration

she turns back to riggan

     martini and scribbles in a notebook with a sour expression

              ordering mike

          and handsome!

she kisses riggan hard on the mouth then gets up giddy and
takes her son by the hand as the couple leaves husband shoves
a five dollar bill into mikes hands

                    husband

                    riggan

mike places the dollar under one of the shot glasses and begins
to walk away but then stops and turns curiously

                    mike
          why raymond carver you never told me

riggan looks at mike for a second than reaches for his wallet
and produces an old cocktail napkin with some writing on it he
slides it to mike

                    riggan
          a long time ago i did a play back in
          high school in michigan he was in the
          audience he sent this backstage after

                    mike
          thank you for an honest performance ray
          carver what is this

riggan looks vulnerable he is trying to make mike understand
the importance of the napkin to build a bridge between them
                    riggan
          and thats when i knew i was going to
          be an actor

mike cant stop himself from smiling

                    riggan contd
          why is that funny

                    mike
          he wrote it on a cocktail napkin


                                                    continued
                                                   10/29/14     /    46

                          riggan
                so

      mike slides the napkin back to riggan

                          mike
                he was drunk

a17                                                                 a17

      he walks away and we follow him as he passes by the bar next
      to tabitha dickinson the critic

                          tabitha
                you headed to hollywood mike

      mike stops

                hollywoods headed here tabby

                          tabitha
                    a devilish smile
                good luck with that

      mike looks directly into her eyes

                          mike
                a man becomes a critic when he can not be an
                artist in the same way that a man becomes an
                informer when he cannot be a soldier
                flaubert right

      he flashes his own devilish smile she stares back if she
      werent so much older than him youd swear there was sexual
      electricity between them

                          tabitha
                hes a hollywood clown in a lycra bird
                suit

                          mike
                yeah and at 8 oclock tomorrow hes gonna
                get on stage and risk everything whatre
                you gonna be doing

                dont you ever worry that ill give you a
                bad review



                                                         continued

                         tabitha
               mr shiner

     mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous riggan he
     goes toward the exit but we stay with tabitha scribbling on
     her notebook suddenly she raises her eyes and with a dark
     expression looks at riggan who is passing by

     we follow riggan toward the exit through the window we see him
     leave the restaurant then we pan to a wooden wall and this
     wall takes us to

19   int hallway  theater  later                               19

     the theater hallway riggan walks through the quiet corridor
     until he arrives at

20   int green room  theater  continuous                       20
     the green room sam sits listlessly drawing some lines
     across a roll of toilet paper

                         sam

                         sam
               means something to who you had a career
               before the third comic book movie before
               people began to forget who was inside the
               bird costume youre doing a play based on
               a book that was written 60 years ago for
               a thousand rich old white people whose
               only real concern is gonna be where they
               go to have their cake and coffee when its
               over nobody gives a shit but you and
               lets face it dad its not for the sake
               of art its because you just want to feel
               relevant again well theres a whole
               world out there where people fight to be
               relevant every day and you act like it
               doesnt even exist! things are happening
               in a place that you willfully ignore a
               place that has already forgotten you i
               mean who are you you hate bloggers you
               make fun of twitter you dont even have a
               facebook page youre the one who doesnt

               youre right you dont its not
               important youre not important get used
               to it

     silence riggan seems devastated and sam can see that

               dad

     she looks at him sympathetically but not knowing what to
     say exits

     after a moment riggan gets up and heads for the trash can he
     digs out the roach grabs some matches and lights it music
     begins to sound he inhales deeply and holds the smoke for a
     few seconds and finally exhales he coughs tosses away the
     joint and heads out of the kitchen we follow him

     as he slowly walks until he disappears into the darkness of
     the corridor we keep moving forward until we end up
                                                   10/29/14   /    51

      backstage we are in the middle of the second preview the
      music continues it belongs to the play

      laura is by herself on stage performing the end of a scene she
      stands in the middle of a surrealistic forest set at dusk
      there is fog and trees a strong artificial wind blows
      through lauras hair desolate music

                          laura
                    to the audience as soliloquy
                in the days before nicks depression really
                started to eat away at him he had no idea
                i was pregnant and i never intended on
                telling him i guess we make choices in
                life and we choose to live with them or
                not i didnt want that baby

      three dancers on stage pass by in front of laura we follow
      the dancers backstage where we find mike and lesley wearing
      pajamas
                          laura os contd
                not because i didnt love nick and not
                because i didnt love the the idea of
                it but because i just wasnt ready to
                love myself theres a certain distance to
                it all now a wistful distance
                underscored by a gentle breeze and the
                sound of the birds laughing at the
                whimsy of it all

      a stage hand helps mike and lesley into a double bed the
      camera slips under the covers with them and stays there

                          mike
                    whispering
                hey les

moment he is somewhere else

a moment of tension

                     mike
               looking at the street
           theres a bald guy about to walk by down
           there spit on his head

                       sam

                       mike
           too late

she stares into mikes eyes knowing shes being tested she
leans over the railing and spits down toward the street
                       sam
           happy

                     man oc
               from the street

first time weve seen a genuine smile from him

                     sam
               nervous pretending
           do you want to fool around with me

a pause

           if you werent afraid what would you want
           to do to me

he carefully considers it then moves his face close to hers
                     mike
           i would want to pull the eyes out of your
           head

           and stick them in my skull and then
           look out at this street and see it the way
           i saw it when i was your age


                                                     continued

      mike turns and stares out at the street once more sam stares
      at the mystery that is mike

                          sam
                gnight mike

a29                                                                a29

      mike stares out into the night we move to his pov the street
      night turns to day pedestrians begin to walk below


b29                                                                b29

      we crawl down the wall until we arrive at riggans dressing
      room window we push in to find

30    int riggans dressing room  theater  day                  30
      riggan siting with his feet on the window frame staring at
      a manila envelope in his hands that reads r malibu
      refinance docs sign and send asap j riggan sighs and props
      the letter up against the mirror

      with a soft knock laura enters she stands in the doorway with
      an odd expression on her face

                            riggan
                what now
      laura lays the arts section of the new york times down in front
      of riggan

                          laura
                dont kill the messenger

      riggan picks up the paper his expression immediately changes
      laura watches him sympathetically

                          laura contd
                hes an asshole

      now we see the cover of the arts section there is a picture
      of mike lounging on a black sofa his bare feet on a table as
      he sips a glass of wine the title of the article reads
      carving out his place in theater history shiner says raymond
      carver is the reason he became an actor riggan involuntarily
      squeezes the paper as he reads on filling with rage

                          birdman vo

                                                        continued

          this cant be it
                    laura
          page twelve

riggan searches desperately for page twelve when he gets
there he finds a huge ad of the new toyota camry that almost
fills the entire page and down in the left corner a tiny
press release with the title

from birdman to carver an aging action hero grasps for his
youth

                    riggan
              reading

               humiliated

                         laura
               youre an asshole
     she charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns
     back to riggan

                         laura contd
               by the way im not pregnant so theres
               one thing you dont have to worry about

     she leaves slamming the door behind her

     riggan remains still mike seems to be smirking at him right
     through the cover of the arts section

                         birdman vo
               that pretentious little theater fuck is

31   int hallway  theater  continuous                          31

          to his tool shed

mikes expression changes

                    riggan contd
          that sonofabitch would smile and say do
          you want to kneel down and unbuckle my
          belt or do you want me to take it off and

riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket

                    riggan contd
          working with riggan thomson is like
          waltzing with a monkey

he smacks mike in the head with the paper and begins to jump in
front of him ready to fight

                    riggan contd
          lets go put your hands up



                                                     continued

                         mike

               your

     riggan punches him on the face mike needs a few seconds to
     understand what has just happened then they begin to wrestle
     in the hallway mike breaks free from the headlock

                         mike contd
               what are you gonna do you gonna get rid of
               me huh what do you think my friend
               tabitha is going to write in the times
               after you get rid of me

     riggan stares at mike paralyzed by the truth finally he
     turns and marches to his dressing room and we follow him

34   int riggans dressing room  theater  continuous             34

     riggan slams the door shut and paces in a rage he glares at
     a makeup box on the table and points his finger at it and
     sends it flying across the room

                         birdman vo
               you are lame riggan rolling around
               with that third rate actor in an 800

                         riggan
                   whispering
               breathing in i feel my rage breathing
               out i embrace my mental formations

                         birdman vo
               youre going to let that poncey theater
               fuck threaten you

     riggan continues breathing deeply with his eyes tightly closed
     he smiles a tiny artificial smile

                         riggan
                   whispering
               breathing in i am calm breathing out

     riggan looks down at the poster on the floor


                                                          continued

                    riggan
              whispering

                    birdman vo
          you were a movie star remember
          pretentious but happy

riggan opens his eyes slowly a sad expression on his face

                    riggan
          i was not happy

                    birdman
          ignorant but charming now you are a
          tiny bitter cocksucker

                    riggan

                     birdman vo
          yeah but fake miserable hollywood

riggan points his fingers at a lamp and sends it flying

                    birdman vo
          what are you trying to prove huh that
          youre an artist youre not

                      riggan

riggan points his fingers at a chair and sends it flying

                    birdman vo
          fuck you coward! and fuck those critics
          that made you quit our franchise

          chest this! totally exploding im

          fucking trivial pursuit question

riggan sits down exhausted



                                                     continued
                                                  10/29/14    /   72

                         riggan contd
               what part of that dont you get youre
               fucking dead

               not you im riggan fucking thomson

               no youre birdman because without me all
               thats left is you a sad selfish
               mediocre actor grasping

     riggan points his finger and sends the poster flying spearing
     it on a coat rack piercing birdman right through the heart
     finally silence until

                         birdman vo
               what the hell did you do that for i liked
               that poster

     a confused riggan looks over to the wall where the lamp on the
     floor is creating a shadow of his figure only in the shadow it
     appears as if riggan is wearing the birdman costume stunned
     riggan slowly lifts one arm and in the shadow we see a wing

                         birdman vo
               its always we brother

     the television turns on by itself playing an episode of the
     original birdman cartoon riggan points his fingers at the tv
     and sends it hurling at the shadow then he proceeds to
     destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers

     we slowly pan to see that behind riggan jake stands on the
     other side of the halfopened door we push in on jake
     watching in shock the camera turns and becomes jakes pov

35   int hallway  theater  continuous                          35

     and now from his view we see riggan yelling at the shadow

                         riggan
               fuck you! fuck you!

     he picks up a chair and throws it down he then picks up the
     newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around and now we
     understand that he is not using telepathy he has been using
     only his hands completely mad as riggan turns to pick up
     something else he spots jake on the other side of the door he
     immediately calms himself and walks over
                                                          continued

finds laura and lesley theyve been listening to his
conversation with riggan

          a strip joint near the airport

laura leaves we follow lesley up to riggans dressing room
she knocks on the door nothing silence she halfopens the
door and from behind her we see riggan examining his right
hand he has blood falling from the palm to the wrist

                    lesley

     she looks at him with tender eyes then we follow her along
     the corridor until she passes by mikes dressing room mike
     halfopens the door and sees lesley walking by he has a
     black eye he waits for lesley to be completely gone and
     then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up

38   ext rooftop  theater  dusk                                  38

          laid out on a gurney we took the old
          couple up to the or they were a
          mess we worked like hell on them for
          most of the night

mike lesley and laura in the kitchen
                    riggan contd
          when we were done we wrapped them in
          full body casts the husband was
          depressed even when i told him his
          wife was gonna pull through he was
          still depressed so i got up to his
          mouth hole and asked him and he told
          me it was because he couldnt see her
          through the eye holes can you imagine
          im telling you the mans heart was
          breaking because he couldnt turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife

emotion

                    riggan
              taking this in
          yeah so i guess what we have to
          ask ourselves is what do we talk
          about when we talk about love

the lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some
scene change music plays as we follow riggan off stage the
lights are turned on again but now they have an orange mood
lesley is the only one on stage doing a monologue

                    lesley
          mel and i have been together five
          years been married for four but
          it was ed who taught me something
          no one else could he taught me
          what it felt like to really feel
          loved and the terrible thing is
          that if something happened to mel
          or myself if something happened to
          either one of us tomorrow i think
          the other one would grieve for a
          while you know but then would go
                    more
                                                    continued

           else soon enough all this all of
           this love were talking about it

           first one to admit it

a dresser waits in the wings to help riggan with his change

riggan looks proud things are finally going well he undresses
to his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins as the
stage begins to revolve laura in costume walks up beside
him over the following dialogue the kitchen gives way to the
extravagant garden set we saw before

               thought i could be a mom my body seems to
               disagree

     the lights come up and laura walks onto the stage

                         laura contd
                   back to him
               you were right this was fun
     riggan watches her go but something else grabs his attention
     we pan across the stage to see sam and mike on the other side
     they talk and laugh sam kisses mike softly mike playfully
     grabs her ass

     we pan back to riggan his expression morphs from broken
     hearted to rage he marches over to a stage hand
                         riggan
               you have a cigarette

     the stage hand holds out a pack riggan takes one

                         stage hand
               you need a light

     riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway
     and out the back door of the theater to

41   ext an alley way  outside the theater  continuous         41

     the alley down at the end we can see the tourists making
     their way about the streets riggan lights the cigarette and
     leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself

                         riggan
               breathing in i calm myself breathing out
               i ease myself

     but this is new york city a fluorescent light buzzes above his
     head taxis honk their horns the sound of pedestrians yelling
     at one another all fueling his agitation
     riggan checks his watch he pulls one last drag from the
     cigarette before he tosses it and turns to head back in only
     to realize the door has locked he tries to pull it open to no
     avail he begins to knock loudly on the door there is no
     response he knocks louder nothing

     he is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is
     caught in the door he checks his watch again and now is
     beginning to panic he tries to tear at the robe but the terry
     cloth is too strong for him to rip frantically he looks around
     for an answer no answer no time he pulls the robe off of him
                                                          continued

     he goes out one of the exits and we are left with the silence of
     the empty hallway after a few seconds the sound of the gunshot
     from the scene echoes through the theater the audience
     applauds the camera starts to move forward a few seconds later
     riggan takes over the pov with his bloody long wig and the fake
     gun we follow up to

46   int riggans dressing room  theater  continuous             46

     his dressing room he puts on a robe he walks to his
     refrigerator without acknowledging sam who is sitting on the
     couch scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again
     riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of
     mustard he sits in front of his dressing table peels open the
     bologna and opens the jar of mustard slice by slice he dips
     the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth

          have been a train wreck we havent been
          able to get through a performance
          without a raging fire or a raging
          hardon im not really sleeping you
          know at all and im pretty much broke
          oh and also this play feels like a
          miniature deformed version of myself
          that keeps following me around hitting
          me in the balls with a tiny hammer
              beat
          sorry what was your question

                    sam
              looking through phone
          never mind tonight wasnt bad it was
          weird but thats sort of cool people
          seemed to like it
                                                     continued
                                               10/29/14   /   88

silence riggan notices the toilet paper

                    riggan
          what are you doing some homework

                    sam
          no i dont when i was in rehab they
          made us do this

                      riggan
          really
                    sam
          yeah these dashes represent the six
          billion years the planet has existed
          each dash represents 100 years

she unravels the roll and we see that there are thousands of
black marks running along the toilet paper she takes the last
two panels and tears them off
                    sam contd
          and this hands them to him is
          supposed to represent the entire time us
          humans have been here one hundred and
          fifty thousand years thats it
              beat
          i guess they were trying to remind us
          that thats what all our egos and self
          obsession are worth

riggan stares at the paper and then at sam

                    riggan
              casually
          i was a shitty father wasnt i

                    sam
          no you were a she stops herself
          you were fine
he stops chewing and stares out

                    riggan
          fine youre right i am just
          fine adorably mediocre

he smiles to her sadly and then he wipes the mustard from his
face with the piece of toilet paper

                      sam
          dad!

                      riggan

                                                10/29/14   /   89

sam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands

                    riggan contd
          oh shit im sorry

                    sam
              smiling
          its okay you just destroyed the entire
          human race in one blow

riggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions
                    sam contd
          dad she hesitates do you know
          youre becoming a trending topic

                    riggan
          really what does that mean

sam searches for something on her iphone and then hands it to
riggan riggan looks at the phone and sees a handheld video of
himself in the streets in his underwear

                    sam
          350000 views in less than an hour
          believe it or not this is power

riggan looks at more footage seemingly confused after a
moment the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a
text message which reads truth or dare

                    riggan
          its for you

she grabs the phone and looks at the screen then at her
father riggan is staring at her she looks down

                    riggan contd
          go ahead

                    sam
              hesitant
          are you

                    riggan
          go

a sympathetic smile an understanding sam exits

riggan stares into the mirror absently his eyes locked on
his reflection trying to find himself in the image then he
spots a vase with dying roses the same roses he flung to the
ground previously


                                                     continued

     he gets up and goes into the bathroom he pulls off the long
     wig and the mustache he washes his face then he opens a
     small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee the
     dark dye begins to run out leaving only white hair for the
     first time we see that riggan has a white beard

     he puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom he grabs
     a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and
     into

47   int hallway  theater  continuous                            47

     the hallway as he passes by mikes door he can hear sam and
     mike theyre trying to be as quiet as possible but we can hear
     them flirting and laughing

     he pauses for a moment but continues on after a few seconds
     his phone vibrates he looks at it a text from jake reads
     have you seen this awesome!!! he clicks the attachment and
     sees the now infamous video of his underwear escapade in the
     street we zoom in until the image fills the screen when we
     finally pull away we discover that

48   int rum house  later                                         48
     riggans video is being played now in a television in the
     bar we see the mtv logo on the bottom of the screen and a video
     caption that reads birdman goes viral 930000 views and
     counting the camera pans to find riggan sitting at the bar
     drunk he is one of the few customers he polishes off his
     drink
                         riggan
               let me have another one

                         bartender
               you got it

     the bartender pours another whiskey for riggan a waiter steps
     up to the bar the bartender points to a martini

                         bartender contd
                   to the waiter
               thats going over to ms dickinson

     riggans head tilts at the mention of the name he looks over to
     see tabitha sitting at a table scratching in her notebook

                         riggan
                   hands the waiter a bill
               i got it shes a friend of mine


                                                         continued
                                              10/29/14   /   91

the waiter pockets the money and gives riggan the drink he
walks it over to tabitha and places it down in front of her not
looking up she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip

riggan sits down across from her she looks up and immediately
recognizes him he takes out the carver cocktail napkin and
pushes it in front of her she looks at him and then down to
the napkin she reads it in silence

                    riggan contd
              re the napkin
          that was twenty years before i put on that
          damned costume

a pause then she pushes the napkin back toward him

                    tabitha

                    riggan

          space in a theater which otherwise might

                    riggan
          but you dont even know if its

                    tabitha

          propaganda piece without going through me
          first so break a leg

tabitha goes back to her writing riggan sits for a moment

                    riggan
          what has to happen in someones life
          for them to end up becoming a critic

                    riggan contd
          whatcha writin you reviewin a play was

                    tabitha
          i will call the police

                    riggan

              he scans the notebook
          callow a label lackluster label
          marginalia sounds like you need
          penicillin to clear that up none the
          less label

               the notebook

tabitha wants to reach for the notebook but her pride wont
let her riggan takes a flower from a vase at the center of the
table

                    riggan contd
          you know what this is you dont do
          you you cant even see it if you dont
          label it you mistake those sounds in
          your head for true knowledge

          are you finished

                    riggan
              wrinkling one of the pages
          nothin about intention structure
                    more

          technique just crappy opinions backed
          up by crappy comparisons youre
          incapable of writing more than a couple
          of paragraphs and you risk nothing of
          yourself
              he tears out the page and tosses
               the notebook
          well im an actor and this play has
          cost me everything so you can take
          your cowardly malicious shittily
          written reviews and shove them up
          your showing her the wrinkled
          page wrinkly tight ass

riggan wears a proud smile and suddenly tabitha begins to
smile with him

                    tabitha
          you think youre an actor
              calls to the waiter

tabitha looks over at riggan picking the perfect verse

                    tabitha
          the scottish play act five

                    waiter

          creeps in this petty pace from day to
          day to the last syllable of recorded
          time and all our yesterdays have lighted
          fools the way to dusty death

he is brilliant the monologue is perfectly played and powerful
riggan being mercilessly reminded of his mediocrity by eddie

                and fury signifying nothing

      a few drunks clap at the beautiful performance then a powerful
      silence rings out for a moment until

                          tabitha

      over and gulps down tabithas entire martini gin pouring out
      the sides of his mouth unaware he slams the empty martini
      glass on top of the carver napkin and gets up we follow him
      out onto

49    ext street  continuous                                    49

      the street where he walks through the theater district
      tired drunk empty neon lights all around him a crazy old
      homeless man passes by in the opposite direction shouting
      furiously riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench
      with a tree behind everything is quiet riggan sits on the
      bench lost we begin to tilt up slowly toward a tall tree
      we move closer into the branches and the green leaves
      silence

a49                                                               a49
      night turns into day the sounds of the city disappear and
      birds begin to sing the branches now caressed by golden shafts
      of morning sun finally we tilt down slowly and find

      alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt birdman uses his
      powerful blow to send the alien flying away

                there you go you mother fucker! see
                gravity doesnt even apply to you

      the camera flies up with riggan as he floats above the street
      there is something magical in his ascension gently impelled by
      the breeze a beautiful backlight makes his body glow birdman
      flutters around him
                          birdman contd

                do this we have to end it on our terms
                with a grand gesture

      a strange light suddenly palpitates in riggans eyes something
      makes sense in what birdman is telling him

      the camera becomes riggans pov he looks down to see the
      people on the street watching him in awe

      and as the camera pulls away we discover birdman is gone and
      riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building the camera
      tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around
      and more cars has stopped and they all point at riggan
      worried about the situation

      a guy wearing shorts a bob marley tshirt and a robe opens his
      window one floor below riggan and looks up at him

                          guy
                dude what are you doing

      riggan looks down at the people on the street far below

          is this for real or youre shooting a
          film

                    lady

she goes into her apartment

                    guy

the guy goes inside his apartment

                    riggan
          one more time

now from the door of the rooftop a good neighbor calmly
approaches riggan

                    good neighbor
          hi sir can i help you you should be
          careful

                    riggan
          sorry cant talk im late
              murmuring
          music

some underscoring music begins to sound the neighbor is now
close to him and helps riggan step down from the edge on to the
floor of the rooftop

                    good neighbor
          are you alright do you want me to
          call someone do you know where to go

riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
toward him he opens his eyes the music begins to swell riggan
stands up straight and proud and in a voice that sounds like
birdman

                    riggan
          yes i know where to go
                                                   continued

      he turns and begins to run on the rooftop the music is rousing
      as he runs he holds out his arms spreading them wide the
      camera runs behind him until suddenly


f50                                                                 f50
      riggan jumps and the camera jumps after him he rapidly
      falls toward the street toward the asphalt but in his face
      there is no fear no he spreads his arms again and


g50                                                                 g50

      he takes flight soaring high over manhattan the music becomes
      epic there is something beautiful about this broken man flying
      like a superhero we fly next to him and we can see below the
      spectacular sight that is manhattan until

51    ext theater  continuous                                     51
      he finally lands on 45th street and calmly approaches the
      theater an usher acknowledges him with a look of surprise

                          usher
                mr thomson i think you forgot to

                          riggan

                i beg your pardon

      riggan enters the theater

      the confused usher watches him go by as he points to the
      street we pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car
      running like a mad man toward us

      we stay with the usher and the taxi driver as they argue they
      take it inside the lobby but we remain out front

      day turns to night igniting the lights   of the marquee which
      reflect off of the lobby doors we hear   wild applause coming
      from inside the theater seconds later   the doors of the
      theater open and the audience files out   for intermission

          we begin to move up outside the theater we see the marquee of
          the play that reads what we talk when we talk about love
          above the title in smaller print riggan thomson and mike
          shiner below on a banner opening night

          gladly

                    riggan
          after you threw the guests out of the
          house and the furniture out of the
          window you locked yourself in the
          bathroom

                    sylvia

                    riggan
          i drove down to malibu i sat on the beach
          for a while just staring out at the
          ocean

                      sylvia
          riggan

                    riggan
          until i walked straight into the water
          and tried to drown myself

silence sylvia stares at riggan surprised

                    riggan contd
          i was in up to my chest when i felt the
          first one on my back like somebody was
          holding a frying pan against me and then
          my chest and my legs the water was full
          of jellyfish i fought my way out of the
          water and i started rolling around the
          sand like a maniac crying

sylvia doesnt know how to react

                    sylvia
          you said it was a sunburn

                    riggan

                    riggan
          i never should have video taped sams
          birth first of all because you and sam
          both look like shit in that video but
          mostly because i missed the moment i
          should have just been there with the two
          of you present in my own life so id
          have it but i dont i dont have any of
          it

          and she got one shamefully successful
          youtube video pretty pathetic

                    sylvia
              putting a finger on
               riggans lips
          shhh there are more pathetic things
          than that that mustache for example

                    annie on speakers
          places for act two places

          you should get back to your seat you

sylvia lingers for a moment and not knowing what to say she
exits riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case he
                                                   continued

     gently opens the lid inside a revolver he takes some bullets
     out of a box and one by one loads them into the chamber as he
     does his vocal exercises into the mirror

                         riggan contd
               twenty little leopards laughed at two
               lofty lions twenty little leopards
               laughed at two lofty lions twenty
               little leopards laughed

     he stares at the dressing room door and with his telekinetic
     powers he opens it he snaps the cylinder into the gun and
     exits out into

53   int hallway  theater  continuous                        53

     the hallway he paces deliberately gun in hand

                         riggan
                   brushing her off
               i dont need it

     annie doesnt seem to understand she stays there holding the
     device riggan takes his place outside the motel door we pan
     toward the audience the auditorium is full the audience in
     complete silence


     riggan knocks firmly on the door silence again then

for the first time riggan turns to face the audience he
smiles the most beautiful insane smile

                    riggan
          i dont exist im not even here i dont
          exist none of this matters

then he raises a trembling arm and with his eyes full of
tears he aims the gun at mike

                       riggan contd
          pum

but he doesnt shoot then he turns and aims at tabitha
dickinson who is sitting on the second row
                       riggan contd
          pum

again no shot slowly riggan raises the gun toward his own
head suddenly a frightening explosion blood sprays riggan
falls we stay with the shellshocked audience a moment of
tension of uncertainty until

                       man
          bravo!

the audience one by one jump to their feet applauding
wildly the sole exception is tabitha who remains seated a
dazed expression on her face we stay with the audience a few
seconds longer

                                           fade to black

the sounds slowly vanish after a moment of silence
                    birdman vo

          anymore

int waiting room  hospital  dawn

one of the old birdman films is playing on a small television
screen that hangs on a corner the scene ends and a morning
show host appears behind him a picture of riggan and a
caption that reads nation in shock a shot of a candle
vigil in central park

                    host
          what do we talk about when we talk
          about riggan thomson when we come
          back more on the actor who two
          nights ago shot himself during the
          opening performance of his new
          broadway play

we pan away from the tv to see that the waiting room is
filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen there is
almost no room to breath

we pan to see jake emerging from an elevator carrying a
newspaper under his arm he walks through the dense mass of
newsmen with a serious expression on his face we follow him
into


int room  hospital  continuous

a room jake peers in riggan lies on a bed the bandages
on his nose cover most of his face sylvia is looking out the

          and metaphorically by artist and
          audience alike red blood the
          blood that has been sorely missing

the bandages after a moment his gaze moves over her
shoulder sylvia turns and we discover sam standing in the
doorway holding a bouquet of flowers a bit of awkward
silence and sylvia decides to leave them alone

she kisses sam on the head and exits sam walks the flowers

              working on phone

          followers in less than a day and
          im about to scare the shit out of

          let me see
                      sam
          no done

a moment between them sam picks up the flowers and kisses
him tenderly on the head riggan is pleasantly surprised by
that kiss

                    sam contd
          now im going to find something to
          put these flowers in

she heads out of the room riggan lies there for a moment
tranquil after a moment he reaches up and touches his
bandages finally he climbs out of the bed we follow him
into


int bathroom  room  hospital  continuous

the bathroom he stands before the mirror he stares at
his reflection for a few seconds and slowly begins to remove
the bandages we can see that riggans nose has been
reconstructed it is a crooked incomplete nose like the one
javier bardem has

                    riggan
          i do look hideous

in the reflection riggan sees birdman sitting on the toilet
they look at each other but say nothing riggan puts the
bandages back on and we follow him out to
                                            10/29/14   /   112

int room  hospital  continuous

the room he looks around but sam is gone he ambles over
to the window his ass hanging out of the back of his
hospital robe he opens the window and feels the sun and the
breeze on his swollen face we just hear the sounds of the
people standing down in the parking lot media trucks fans
we stay with riggan who seems to be thinking about
something he sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky then
he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
step up onto the sill
the camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
propped on it one of he and sam when she was a child one
with sylvia and sam a copy of carvers what we talk about
when we talk about love laying on the surface

the camera continues to pan until it comes to the door sam
enters with a small vase she looks around

                    sam
          dad

she goes to the bathroom and peers in nothing

                    sam contd
          dad

she spots the opened window and registers the sounds from
outside tentatively she walks toward the window she gets
there summons her courage and looks down nothing slowly
confused she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky a
smile filled with pride begin to wash over her face
