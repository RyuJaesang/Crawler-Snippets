		jack looks downtheres a womans head resting on his 
		chest

		a look of confusion crosses his facetrying to 
		remember did he meet a woman last night

		he turns his head to find a large mutt sitting 
		faithfully beside the bed wagging his tail

		did she have a dog

		he looks down at the woman again craning his neck to 
		get a look at her face  and then he sees her

		kate reynolds

		now 34 and even more beautiful a look of utter 
		contentment on her radiant face sleeping soundly

		his head darts around the room  its cramped and lived 
		in clothes and toys are strewn about family photos on 
		the dresser laura ashley curtains a tiny poster bed 
		and a charming little bay window

		he instinctively reaches for his franck mueller watch 
		on the night stand but its not there  its a timex 
		indiglo and it reads 757 am

		jack looks back at katehe rubs his eyesmaybe its 
		a dreambut nothing changes  then kate stirs

					kate
			   mmmmten more minutes 
			   jack its christmas

		jack jumps as he hears kate talk for the first time

		suddenly the door bursts opena six year old girl 
		annie in a little nightgown walks into the room 
		carrying an 18 month old boy josh singing at the top 
		of her lungs

					annie

		everybody else and leaving very little room  annie 
		starts jumping

					annie contd
			   riseandshine!

					kate
				stirring

					annie

			   need to open the 
			   presents

					kate
				groggy
			   mommy needs five more

		josh crawls directly up to jacks stomach climbing 
		on

					annie
			   cmon dad  get up!

		she said dad

		thats it  jack moves the baby gingerly over then 
		gets out of bed stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
		next to it

		he picks up the batthe same willie mays autograph 
		bat that was encased in glass in his ny apartment

		frightened jack drops the bad looking down at himself 
		for the first timehes naked

		a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on

		rubbing his hands together to warm them up

		chapter eleven  home movies

		he goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
		scotch taking a sip letting the alcohol warm him

		he strolls through the room looking at some of the 
		family photos framed and hanging on the wall focusing 
		on his own face in the pictures studying the 
		expressions

		he moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf 
		marked with titles like trip to yosemite 96 and 
		joshs 1st birthday  he runs his fingers along the 
		tapes stopping at one marked jack singing  his

			please lets just go have 
			a cup of coffee thats all 
			im asking for im sure 
			theres another flight to 
			paris tonight

					kate
			what do you want from me 
			you want me to tell you 
			everything that happened 
			was okay

		jack just stands there unsure

					kate contd
			well it is yes i was 
			heartbroken but i got 
			over it i moved on 
			people change jack i 
			changed i dont know 
			why you suddenly feel the 
			need to revisit that time 
			in our lives but i assure 
			you its over

		kate turns her back to jack leaving him standing 
		there

		he watches her walk to the podium realizing shes 
		right

		he sees kate reach the podiumhand her ticket to the 
		attendant

		finally a look of determination crosses his face

					jack
				at kate
			we have a house in jersey!

		kate turns to him with a look that could kill

					kate
			dont do this jack
			but he continues

					jack
			we have two kids annie and 
			josh

		kate looks at him halfmortified half
		interested

					jack contd
			annies not much of a 
			violin player but she 
			tries really hard shes a 
			little precocious but thats 
			only because she says whats 
			on her mind and when she 
			smiles

		jack shakes his head remembering fighting back the 
		tears

					jack contd
			and joshhe has your eyes 
			he doesnt say much but we 
			know hes smart
				lost in the memory
			hes always got his eyes 
			open always watching us
			sometimes you can look at 
			him and just know that hes 
			learning something new
			its like witnessing a 
			miracle

		kates expression has sifted from annoyance to 
		curiosity

					jack contd
			the house is a mess but 
			its ours
				chuckling
			well after a hundred 
			twenty two more payments 
			it will be

		jack begins walking slowly toward katethe world of 
		the airport going on around him jack not caring

					jack contd
			and youyoure a non
			profit lawyer thats right 
			completely nonprofit but 
			that doesnt seem to bother 
			you

		kate raises an eyebrow its something shes thought 
		about

					jack contd
			and were in love after 
			thirteen years of marriage 
			were still unbelievably 
			in love
				with a chuckle
			you wont even let me touch 
			you until ive said it

		jack gets closer and closerkates spellbound now 
		imagining the picture jacks painting

					jack contd
			i sing to younot all 
			the time but definitely on 
			special occasions

		jack walks into a piece of carryon luggage sitting by a 
		row of passengers

					jack contd
				off hand to passenger
			excuse me
				to kate
			we made a lot of sacrifices 
			dealt with our share of 
			surprises but we stayed 
			together

		jacks nearly there

					jack contd
			you see youre a better 
			person than i am

		not in this life and kate knows it

					jack contd
			and it made me a better 
			person to be around you

		kate is perfectly still jacks words echoing in her 
		ears

					jack contd
			maybe it was all a 
			dream maybe i went to 
			bed one lonely night in 
			december and imagined it 
			all but i swear 
			nothings ever felt more 
			real to me

		hes right in front of her she cant take her eyes 
		off him

					jack contd
			and if you get on that 
			plane right now itll 
			disappear forever

		silence jack and kate in their own little 
		worldairport business going on around them

					jack contd
			i know we can both go on 
			with our lives and wed 
			both be fine but ive 
			seen what we can be like 
			togetherand i choose 
			us

		jacks words resonate in her ears he gently touches a 
		hand to her arm

					jack contd
			please kate one cup of 
			coffee you can always go 
			to paris just please not 
			tonight

		she stands there frozen staring into jacks eyes 
		searching for the answer

					kate
			okay jack

		dissolve to

	131	int airport  late night

		jack and kate framed in the window of a nearly empty 
		airport coffee shopthrough the window we see snow 
		falling outside

		from a distance we see themtalking and laughing over 
		a cup of coffee

		fade out
