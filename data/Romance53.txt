    as all things do it begins in the dark eyes blink
    open blue eyes the first thing they see is a woman
    near 40 standing looking out a window watching the wind
    blowing rattling a window

    now we see were in a hospital room with layers of white
    enamel paint trying without success to hide the years
    an old woman past 80 withered still regal with a green
    turban around her bald head is propped by pillows her
    blue eyes looking out at us from her bed shes
    connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
    drip her name is daisy fuller she speaks with a
    southern lilt

                            daisy

              wouldnt have a hurricane season

                            caroline

              can be like here ive lived with
              four seasons so many years now

    we see a young black woman a caregiver dorothy baker
    in a corner thumbing a magazine with one eye at the
    window

                            dorothy baker

              firewood to close a hole in a
              levee

    but daisy has other things on her mind murmuring

                                                                    2

                 it all runs together like a
                 fingerpainting i feel like im
                 on a boat drifting

                               caroline
                      tenderly
                 can i do anything for you mother
                 make anything easier

                                daisy
                 hmmm there is nothing to do
                 caroline this is what it is
                 im finding it harder to keep my
                 eyes open my mouth all filled
                 with cotton

    and agitated feeling confined she scratches at her
    nightgown as if it were sticking to her she starts to take
    it off dorothy gets up and straightens it for her

                               dorothy baker
                 there there miss daisy youll
                 scratch yourself to ribbons
                      to caroline
                 its their way of letting go
                      the finality
                 probly today

    caroline is well aware of it but the words her
    admonition of death being so close at hand makes
    everything even more present

                               caroline
                 do you want more medication
                 mother the doctor said you can
                 have all you want

    daisy is quiet looking into the distance caroline
    seeking closure sits on the bed with her and starts to
    cry daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter
    comforting her

                               caroline contd
                 a friend told me she never had a
                 chance to say goodbye to her
                 mother
                      grateful to have the
                       chance
                 i wanted to thank you mother for
                 bringing me into this world for
                 raising me so well
                               more

                                                      continued

              i wanted to tell you how much
              youve meant to me im going to
              miss you so much

    they hold each other for some time they separate
    and theres an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
    about nothing left to say to each other a hole in
    their relationship caroline fills it with the eternal
    question

                            caroline contd
              are you afraid

                             daisy
              curious   what comes next

    she winces at some physical pain

                            dorothy baker
              the pains coming more steadily
              her breathing will falter soon
              no need for her to suffer

    she raises the morphine level daisy closes her eyes
    drifting with the morphine and a thought a dream a
    sound crosses her mind and she says

                            daisy

     of the clock politicians citizens and pickpockets
     alike

     and we see the distinctive figure of theodore roosevelt
     in overcoat and hat the war heavy on his shoulders we
     watch mr cake with the aid of an assistant climbing
     the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape
     he stands for a moment and with a simple tug releases
     the purple swath people gasp at the magnificent
     clock mr cake winds the clock which chimes a
     glorious chime pushed by an angel the secondhand
     begins its eternal journeygoing around everyone
     cheers until they realize the clock is going the wrong
     way traveling backwards in time a man shouts its
     running backwards!

                                monsieur gateau
                  i made it this way so that
                  perhaps the boys who were lost in
                  the war might stand and go home
                  again

     and we see just that bullets leaving mens wounds
     sailing back into the rifles from whence they came
     limbs whole again cannon balls rocketing backwards
     into the cannons breech fallen come to their feet to
     live and breathe again

                             benjamin buttons vo
               the war to end all wars had ended

     we see the streets of new orleans are filled with
     drunken singing revelers cars jamming the
     cobblestones people kissing shouting joyful another
     burst of fireworks

     and we see in the fireworks light a young man in his
     early 30s thomas button running up to the gate of a
     fashionable town home he nearly collides with a priest
     who arrives there at the same time thomas runs past
     him up the steps

20   int button house new orleans  night 1918                20

     he runs past a solemn maid and up a long staircase
     barging into the master bedroom

                                                                    10



21   int master bedroom button house  night 1918                 21

      where we see a young woman is lying on a bloody bed
     frantically being administered to by a doctor with the
     help of the small domestic staff the priest enters

                             thomas button
                    seeing him
               why are you here

                             the doctor
               thomas im afraid shes not going
               to survive

     and the priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
     young woman and the maids bringing bedsheets
     futilely start to change her bloody linens

                             thomas button
               thats enough! all of you!

     they move out of the way and thomas kneels beside his
     wife shes pale white fear in her soft brown eyes
     he takes her hand

                             thomas button contd

                             his young wife
               promise me thomas

     and she is interrupted by the sudden cry of a baby    but
     thomas cant take his eyes from his dying wife

                             his young wife contd
               promise me he has a place

     he doesnt understand she looks up at him holds his
     hand tight then she slips away the doctor listening
     for her pulse he covers her its quiet the
     priests murmured incantations the housemaids
     crying



                                                      continued

                                                                 11

                  she gave her life for me and
                  for that i am forever grateful

     thomas still holding her hand is unable to let go
     when we hear again the baby crying the babys cry is
     not quite right it is not an infants cry for succor
     or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs its a
     deep haunting cry from some primal soul they all
     turn and the room stills listening as the baby
     continues its mournful wail only thomas goes to
     answer the baby in a basket swaddled in a thick
     blanket its face covered with cloth thomas goes to
     lift it to see his sons face

                                   maid
                  mr button!

     he lifts the cloth anyway he recoils for he has
     seen some kind of horror he makes the smallest of
     sounds a whispered ohhhh and then he suddenly
     snatches up the swaddled baby  running with it out of
     the room downstairs outside

22   ext new orleans  night 1918                              22

      thomas tears on his face carrying his crying baby
     through the streets pushing through crowds

23   ext a bridge new orleans  night 1918                    23

      he comes along an old bridge over a waterway the
     air heavy with the haze of fireworks the water dark
     brokenhearted he lifts the baby to throw it into the
     black water he is just at the apex of this throw when
     despite his sadness he cant bring himself to do it
     instead cradles the newborn

                                thomas
                  im sorry im so sorry

     a lantern lights his face a policeman down the way

      porch voices from inside people talking and
      laughing the baby soothed by the soft yellow light
      by the music of the voices by the house itself  stops

      voices coming thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
      porch steps he takes out every last dollar he has
      tucking the money inside the babys blanket we can
      just see the figures of two people coming from inside
      thomas knocks on the weathered screen door and his
      decision made he turns moving away from the house

     old man

     and with that she puts the baby into the top dresser
     drawer with her unmentionables and shuts it
     leaving it open just a crack enough to breathe
     turning she sees an old woman looking very lost
     looking in the room

     closes the door and we stay behind for a moment
     inside queenies underwear drawer with the smell of a
     lilac sachet is the baby with the face of an old
     man looking up at the sliver of light coming into the
     dresser drawer

27   int parlor nolan house new orleans  night 1918        27

     done this longer than he cares to remember finishing
     examining one of the elderly boarders he puts his
     things into his doctors bag queenie comes beside him
     saying something

                  child so we need to take very
                  good care of him

     we see tizzys come out of the kitchen  watching with an
     air of strong disapproval and an old woman says

                                one of the women

     they all laugh their laughter makes the baby seem to
     smile the lonely smile of an old dying man

30   int queenies room  still later that night 1918          30

     we see queenie unable to sleep lying in bed looking

               golden years

     the boarders eating dinner queenie in a white
     uniform along with tizzy wearing a chefs hat and
     apron helping her serve we move across the ancient
     faces until we come to one particular face wearing
     eyeglasses now but the same wrinkled face weve come
     to know the face of a very old man



                                                    continued

     the face of benjamin button when he should normally be a
     sixyearold hes sitting in a wheelchair now small
     shrunken hunched with age legs and hands crippled with
     arthritis eyeglasses are just one addition a
     hearing aid a bulky apparatus of its time is in one
     ear but if we look even closer we can see there are
     sprouts of hair wisps of white what would be the
     last hair for some seem to be growing in as we
     watch him eat he uses his fork like a child might
     banging it just for the hell of it making noise

                                queenie
                  stop bangin that fork
                       fixing it in his

                  with and use your napkin

     the old men feeding him benjamin just another old man
     having dinner with his contemporaries

34   ext the porch nolan house new orleans  night 1925      34

     a line of old people in rockers benjamin like any six

                  whats there

     nobody says anything rocking benjamin eternally
     curious needing to know suddenly wheels himself
     precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
     is lower and he just sees the street children running
     on the street playing carriages dropping people off
     for a party he leans forward to get an even better
     view when queenie suddenly grabs him

                                queenie

     legs akimbo stands the people all applaud

     arthritic legs give out and he sprawls to the floor
     the aides in white nurses uniforms move to help but

                                the preacher contd

     and benjamin one crippled leg at a time hobbles across
     the stage the people urging him on a string of
     hallelujahs! queenie comes to join him urging
     him

                             queenie
               let the lord carry you 

     the preacher walking along with him more a dance
     than a walk shouting the name of the lord queenie and
     the preacher walking benjamin across the stage
     benjamin making it to the other end to a roar of
     amens!

59   int a room nolan house  late at night 1930                 59

     has come inside she slightly touches benjamin

                             daisy

     she doesnt say anything she leads him into the dining
     room where we see the wash has been draped sheets and
     pillowcases like ghosts over the dining room table and
     a smaller side table and a buffetto dry

                               daisy
               under here

                                 elizabeth abbott
                   married women dont usually sit
                   with strange men in a hotel in the
                   middle of the night i certainly

                   or dont do

                                 elizabeth abbott
                   lets get one thing straight i
                   love him very much i happen to
                   think he is one of the smartest
                   and most considerate men i ever
                   met it is not his fault i decided
                   to spend my life in his shadow

      and with that she gets up and leaves benjamin left

                   the war found us

      as they move through the water their propeller
      literally chopping up bodies to where they have to
      veritably shut their engines down

                   a transport carrying 900 men had
                   been hit by a torpedo we were
                   first to arrive at the scene

      and as the tug arrives at the scene we see a transport
      vessel with a gaping hole in its midships sinking
      quickly fuel oil burning on the water
                                                       continued

      water in the burning black oil the transport boat
      silently slips into the water disappearing under the
      sea

      and we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion
      and daisy dressed for the night glides out a man
      helping her and we see benjamin a step behind getting
      out of the car dressed to the nines hair slicked
      elegant but nonetheless a step behind and we hear
      daisys voice from somewhere else

                              daisys v0

                choreographer he said i had a
                perfect line they asked
                ballenchine to describe what he
                did he said im a carpenter
                isnt that amazing in one of his
                rehearsals a dancer fell he put
                it into the production can you
                imagine that in a classical
                ballet a dancer intentionally

      the door to the restaurant held open for daisy another
      man showing her inside benjamin forgotten for the
      slightest of moments at the door going after her

      a crowded new orleans restaurant daisy as a maitre d in
      slow motion is showing her to a table mens and even
      womens eyes following her

                              daisys v0
                they have torn up all the
                conventions the straight up and
                down style all the things that
                bound dancersits not about the
                formality of the dancethe
                classical structureits about
                what the dancers feelingthere
                are no rules the movement can be
                tense or relaxed abrupt or
                flowing carefree or somber it
                may suggest love or hate
                attraction or repulsion the
                unexpected shifts of weight or
                energy  not just to shock but to
                reinvent traditionputting the
                familiar form to new and
                unexpected uses its so basic
                just you alone with your body

      they reach a table a chair in slow motion swept out
      for her to sit another man in slow motion putting a
      napkin in her lap

                              daisy vo
                they understand americas vigor
                and physicality  they understand

                people at their most modern at
                their best

                and she told me about this world
                that she was so attracted to
                names that didnt mean a thing to
                mei didnt really hear very
                much of what she was saying

      we watch them at the table benjamin listening
      appreciating her her face aglow with the intensity and
      the passion of youth caviar is brought over
      vodka she screws up her mouth not wanting to eat we
      can sense hes telling her what hes learned from
      elizabeth abbott how to savor it he feeds her a
      spoonful they drink the vodka washing it down she
      laughs delighted and we now hear what she is
      saying

                   im enjoying listening

      she takes out a cigarette he instinctively looks for
      matches a man gets there first lighting her cigarette
      for her he watches the smoke curl around her
      appreciating her

      startled as a young man david suddenly grabs her
      kissing her a kiss thats not intended to be platonic
      daisy obviously involved with him but embarrassed by
      the intimacy in front of benjamin and not wanting to hurt
      his feelings she pulls awkwardly away from him

      and daisy comes back out with a drink for him and one
      of her own but before she can give him his drink a
      woman takes it from her and starts to dance with
      her but not with her the way dancers do and many
      of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like
      it david comes to dance with daisy benjamin
      standing watching daisy dancing with him as only
      dancers can in complete control of their bodies and

      years they embracefor some time and kiss as
      people who havent seen each other and have thought
      about each other for a very long time and it just
      isno big symphonies no endless skiesjust two
      people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives

      a kiss that has waited for thirty years a kiss that has
      waited a lifetime and yes there is passion and
      need but most particularly the awkwardness of people
      discovering each other for the first time while he
      gently tenderly kisses her undresses her

      acceptance that this is what her life is now he
      crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door
      behind him

      twelve years since weve last seen her 56 now her
      hairs cut short and its gone mostly gray and
      although her age is on her face she still has a dancers
      posture her head held high carrying herself with
      grace and one thing that will never change are her
      unforgettable blue eyes we hear the door opening
      daisy busy gathering saying her goodnights glances
      toward the door across the studio and she sees a young
      man has come in a young man in his twenties standing
      silently a stranger standing by the door daisy as
      she closes up the studio makes her way toward him
      saying goodnight to people she bends to pick up a
      ballet slipper

                   doctors who looked at him think he
                   may be autistic

      and just then we hear a piano playing as if it were
      being played by a child with no skill banging as
      much as anything and daisy follows the sound of the
      piano into the parlor

273   int parlor nolan house  day 1990                            273

      over trying to play the piano trying to play the
      tune the woman had taught to him

                                 daisy
                   benjamin

      indication he recognizes her at all

                                 benjamin at twelve
                   do you know this song

      and he tries to play what he thinks is the song but is
      nothing more than a child playing random notes

                                 daisy
                   you play really beautifully

      she comes and touches his back he shrinks from her

                   he doesnt seem to like to be

                   the doctors said if they didnt
                   know any better he goes in and
                   out of states of recognition as
                   if he had the beginnings of
                   dementia

      daisys looking at the boy who was once the man she
      loved who she still loves she looks into his

                                                                    183

                   planning to do

      daisy nods caroline goes out of the room its quiet
      daisys alone now looking out the window at the
      howling hurricane a hundred mile an hour fury and
      fighting against the wind trying to reach the window is
      a hummingbird it almost makes it and is pushed back by
      the gale but undaunted its wings doing a figure
      eight the symbol for infinity it fights its way
      through the wind to the window tapping at the
      window and the hummingbird flies away she watches
      it go and after some moments she says

                                 daisy
                   goodnight benjamin

      and she closes her eyes for the very last time and
      its dark where its peaceful even safe

301   int train station new orleans  day present                301

      we see the new clock high on the terminal wall running
      the right way going forward and as the clock
      turns people hurrying to their destinations living
      their lives

302   int storage room train station new orleans  day           302

      a storage room old track signs old waiting room
      chairs the discarded and forgotten and lying on its
      side under an old tarpaulin  is mr cakes clock
      the angel still pushing the hands running backwards
      forever

                                                        fade out
