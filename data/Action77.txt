          courier with them

          49 a german staff car 49
          approaches as its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle
          it slows and pulls off to the side 

          50 directly over the ditch 50
          where tuvia and zus are concealed from within the car we
          hear voices speaking german a young private gets out and
          walks up the road to investigate

          the pissing sergeant
          catches the flicker of movement below sees zus lying in
          the ditch stunned he tries to zip up his fly it catches
          zus leaps up brandishing the knife hes on the sergeant
          before he can get the gun off his shoulder stabbing him
          through his greatcoat the blade breaks off in his hand
          meanwhile the lieutenant drops his cigarette reaching
          under his coat for a pistol tuvia tackles him the gun
          skids away they roll around on the road clawing punching
          biting tuvia slams the mans head against the pavement

          52 up the road 52
          the private sees asael and peretz coming at him jacov
          follows with his rifle the private turns and runs down
          the road they give chase

          53 from inside the car 53
          another officer is in the back seat with a woman he reaches
          for his gun stands up in the seat and begins firing wildly
          at tuvia tuvia rolls under the car avoiding the burst
          meanwhile zus uses the handle of the knife to break the
          sergeants nose he rips the schmeisser away firing point
          blank into the man whose greatcoat catches fire

          inside the staff car
          the officer takes close aim at tuvia just as zus turns the
          machine gun on the car blowing out the windows killing the
          officer and the woman  and saving his brothers life

          54 meanwhile down the road 54
          jacov fires at the private misses the man keeps running
          jacov fires again misses again
          finally his third shot hits him in the leg the private
          keeps running limping now

          jacov
          i got him!
          peretz and asael can now catch up to the soldier

          from far away

          until jacov catches up to them and fires a final shot

          clear if they can make it into the woods a flare ignites
          overhead turning the wheat fields bright white in flickering
          incandescence malbin is almost paralytic with fear
          asael doesnt know which way to run he plunges into the
          wheat fieldbut on the wrong side of the road
          one of the trucks drives forward cutting him off using
          its spotlight to reveal him fifteen soldiers start after
          him

          hes going to go back after him instead he wedges the
          rifle into a treetrunk and takes careful aim

          the spotlight shatters
          plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out
          asael seizes the moment and dives to his knees disappearing
          from view and crawling now rather than expose himself
          an irrigation ditch is nearby frantically he digs into
          the soft mud on its banks as he scrapes his hands raw he

          away

          you are no longer commander sorry
          tuvia nods considering his remark for a moment

          and then takes out his pistol and shoots arkady in the chest!
          he then turns the gun on motl and the others  they
          literally cower in fear he raises his voice to those
          watching

          tuvia
          as long as i am the leader of this
          group you will obey my commands

          leave it for the wolves

          they have witnessed tuvia walks away
          behind them the group separates  staring at the lifeless
          body on the ground and then they look at each other their
          blood lust sated beginning to reckon with what they have
          done what they have become

          138 tuvia stands alone in the forest his face in shadow 138
          he sees aron squatting beside a tree crying silently
          tuvia kneels beside him cradling him

          his face is drawn and pale from what has just happened

          people and bodily drags them to cover
          strafing 20mm cannon chew up the ground
          several people are hit before they can reach cover lilka
          herds everyone she can into

          145 a bunker 145
          where people crowd in like sardines chaya and riva gather
          children around them they hear the whistle of an incoming
          shellboom! dirt from the roof rains down on them

          146 bombs begin to rain down 146
          dirt and debris everywhere an incendiary shell hits high
          in a tree its branches burst into flame
          an hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is blown apart

          147 meanwhile  in viktors camp 147
          zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping
          on his brothers

          148 back in the bielski camp  a direct hit on a zemylanka 148
          it explodes into a million pieces wood shrapnel everywhere
          where once was a bunker now there is only a gaping crater
          tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded

          an explosion knocks him down
          he tries to clear his head but he cannot focus all sound
          fades away to be replaced by a highpitched hum

          149 tuvias world is in slowmotion 149
          falling dirt and debris tumbling bodies exploding bunkers 
          a surreal effect

          150 in real time  the camp is being torn apart 150
          cowering in safety malbin sees tuvia lying in the open and
          gathers his courage  racing through danger to his side

          malbin runs off asael helps tuvia to his feet a nearby
          explosion showers them with dirt as they crawl to safety
          the world ramps back to normal speed at a dizzying rate

          asael contd
          we need to hold them offuntil

          152 others emerge from the bunkers 152
          young people holding hands with old parents with children
          on their backs tuvia urges lilka and bella to hurry them
          into the woods

          153 meanwhile  the assigned defenders men and women alike 153
          take up their assigned positions levine mans the heavy
          machine gun behind a log lazar miriam and rosa in the
          trees
          tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children
          to disappear into the forest

          a sudden silence descends  everyone looks to the sky
          tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack
          he knows the ground troops will soon follow
          he turns to asael grabbing his shoulders

          tuvia
          dont try to fight just slow
          them down then join us
          asael nods no need for more words they embrace fiercely

          tuvia
          come
          he forces her to join him and catch up to the others

          154 the camp 154
          is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle the defenders
          check their weapons with grim efficiency they are no longer
          inept innocents they have become warriors

          155 deeper in the woods 155
          tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on

          156 moments later  the defenders wait anxiously 156
          we study their faces beautiful in their stoic acceptance

          asael fires blindly into the murky shadows the sound of a
          man crying out
          then levine is hit miriam pushes him out of the way and
          takes over she expertly kills several assault troops who
          appear out of the woods
          the rest of the attackers take cover

          lazar runs from tree to tree keeping up a steady stream of
          fire he is surprisingly brave until a grenade flies out
          of the woods and lands at his feet killing him instantly
          the assault troops have begun to outflank them asael is
          suddenly in jeopardy sara sees the danger

          miriam keeps their attackers pinned down as the two men
          race for new positions then she is hit she keeps firing
          anyway her finger locked on the trigger even as she is
          dying
          more troops begin firing from their flank asael has no
          choice but to break off they race into the woods

          170 suddenly  up the riverbank 170
          trees begin to fall over  as if pushed by a dinosaur

          a panzer tank
          emerges onto the banks less than a quarterofmile away

          its turret begins to swivel
          the menacing gun turning in their direction

          171 the group is caught out in the open 171
          the tank roars fire the first round explodes among them
          several are killed

          tuvia
          back to the river!
          he pushes people down they cling to the banks cowering
          those with weapons take cover using the embankment as if
          it were the lip of a trench
          they return fire  old men young women even some children

          172 a squad of german infantry advances 172
          behind the tank using it as protection
          aron kills one but the germans are welltrained they
          direct a withering fire  forcing the partisans to keep
          their heads below the embankment

          but the tank is unstoppable
          it turns its attentions on the riverbank  its first round
          sails overhead sending up a huge geyser of water
          but the next round plows into the earth tearing a huge
          chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade
          tuvia grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades
          he throws the satchel over malbins head grabs his arm and
          races crouching low beneath the lip of the riverbank
          asael provides covering fire so do lilka chaya and the
          women alongside the men

          up ahead
          a stand of trees hides tuvia from view as he climbs out of
          the river and heads into the forest he pulls malbin down
          just as a squad of german infantry approaches and begins to
          set up a heavy machine gun

          advancing behind the tank  to devastating effect
          but now the tank turns its attention to tuvia its machine
          gun begins to chew up the forest forcing tuvia to take
          cover
          without pausing to think malbin grabs a grenade from the
          satchel and races toward the tank
          it falls pitifully short exploding harmlessly as malbin is

          it is only a matter of moments before he is dead

          when suddenly from out of the woods
          zus and the rest of jewish fighters emerge firing on the

          the german infantry is caught in a crossfire as the bielski
          brigade climbs out the river firing wildly
          zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun
          from the open hatch jumps onto the tank and drops a grenade
          inside an explosion of black smoke billows
          zus stands up amid the billowing smoke he sees tuvia who
          is staring back at him
