     nico in the point   leading fox and the three cit chemical
     interrogation team   men down an unmarked twisting trail
     we see from nicos   gait that he is athletic a born leader
     and totally at home   in the jungle
11   trail  late afternoon

     let us know these guys are way out in the boonies

12   ext jungle  night

     the sky glows from nearby bomb attacks
13   nico

     listening hard  and even sniffing the air  glances back
     at zagon who stands impatiently drawing on a cigarette
                                zagon
                  what are you looking at hotshot

                                nico

     irritably zagon ditches his smoke
                             zagon
               just drive the taxi ace

     as the party moves out fox flashes nico a look as if to say
     dont fuck with these guys

14   ext cambodian base camp  night

     a pocketfortified position armed cambodian lookouts
     several hooches radio equipment nico leads the party in
     through the perimeter zagon eyes the layout like hes seen
     100 of them fox indicates a hooch
                             fox
                      to zagon
               theyre in there

     the three cit men start for the hooch nico casts a concerned
     glance around at the base camp troops looking sloppy as hell
                             nico
               i dont trust these yoyos
15   full shot  base camp
     we see nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
     to another checking the perimeter we can vaguely hear him
     rousting the cambodian lookouts speaking in dialect

16   defensive position  nico
     hears a sound looks back toward the hooch
17   nicos pov  hooch
     two asian prisoners stripped to the waist babbling in
     coherently are dragged out the back by a pair of cambodian
     guards and hustled off into the darkness voices can be
     heard inside the hooch a single lantern glowing inside
     gives the hut a creepy frightening aspect

18   back to nico
     hes extremely uneasy about whats about to happen inside the
     hooch

19   int hooch  close on rickety card table  night
     on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes drug vials
     and surgical instruments zagons hand picks up a hypodermic
     squirttests it

                                                          4

20   two asian prisoners
     are on their knees shirtless handcuffed with heavy nylon
     tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
     hooch one of the subordinate cit men moves in grabs the
     first prisoner by the shoulders zagon injects the first
     prisoner instantly the man begins shivering convulsing
     zagon watches with professional satisfaction

                               zagon
                 thats the nice thing about modern
                 technology you dont have to wait
                 for results

     he moves close to the first prisoner
                               zagon
                        to first prisoner
                 where is it charley you got six tons
                 of our shit 
     the prisoner tries to speak but hes in such torment all
     that comes out is a bloodcurdling wail 
21   ext bast camp  nico

     hears this horrifying cry   he starts swiftly toward the
     hooch 
22   int hooch  interpreter

     has moved as close to zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
     referee to two boxers the prisoner is convulsing wildly
     zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair
                               zagon
                 dont you die on me fucker 
                               fox
                        from the side
                 what the hells wrong
                               zagon
                        throws the prisoner
                         down
                 this pussy cant hold his liquor

     the first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm

23   nico
     enters at this point he takes in the scene quickly moves
     to a spot beside the entrance zagon doesnt look at nico
     but its plain he is aware of nicos presence it is as if
     he wants to prove something to this muscular kid  and prove
     it to the others too

24   first prisoner
     dies in agony on the ground

25   second prisoner
     watches with eyes like flint he is in his midforties
     scarred missing several fingers probably a colonel or
     higher he looks like hes been fighting these roundeyes
     since the french in the 50s he is plainly one tough
     customer the second prisoner meets zagons eyes as if
     daring him to use the drugs on him too zagon eyes the
     prisoner with barely contained hatred the prisoner doesnt
     back down an inch
                             zagon
                      to second prisoner

               it to open your yap                                 *
     zagon reaches to a scabbard on his western belt pulls out a
     fearsome serrated blade  a cross between a bowie knife and
     a scalpel he steps toward the prisoner displaying the
     blade in the lantern light

26   nico
     watches impassively
                             zagon os
                      to prisoner
               wheres our load you sack of slime
               what did you do with my shit 
27   zagon
     punches  the prisoner full in the face holding the knife
     handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
     terrify  him with the proximity of the blade the prisoner
     crashes  sideways face bloody 
                             zagon
               im gonna teach you good im gonna
               teach you never to fuck with my
               opium 

28   fox and two cit men

     seem to know exactly what this is about
29   nico

     didnt know but the new kid on the block is catching on fast
     nico has difficulty containing his emotion zagon stands
     over the prisoner as if daring him to get back up

                                                    6

the prisoner gets back to his knees bloody eyes meeting
zagons with defiance 

                       zagon
                to prisoner
         youre a hard nigger arent you boy

         it from the french youll be fucked
         if some yankee peckerwoods gonna start
         your gums flapping 
nico watches zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner

                       zagon
          well youre gonna chirp for me
         tough guy youre gonna sing like a
         choir 

nico takes a step toward zagon
                       nico
         what the fuck does this have to do
         with military intelligence
                       zagon
         your orders are assist and observe
         cherry 
zagon turns to face nico 

                       fox
                to nico
         back off partner 
zagon turns from nico he moves close to the second prisoner
close as a lover displaying the blade in the lamplight
                       zagon
                to second prisoner
         im gonna start carving at your ankles
         well throw your feet in that box right
         over there then im gonna take off
         your arms 
one of the cit men yanks the prisoners leg forward clamping
it to the ground with his hands the prisoner still hasnt
flinched he seems as locked into this dance of death as
zagon
                         nico
                  cant take
                   much more

                       fox
         shut up nico

                                                         7

                             zagon
               you can disappear as easy as this
               slope kid 

     zagon starts for the prisoner here comes the blade
     suddenly  nico grabs zagons shoulder zagon spins with
     terrifying quickness cocking the blade to slash at nico
     before zagons blow even starts nico slams him with a
     ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw zagon literally
     comes off the ground nicos blow is so terrific zagon drops
     in an unconscious heap in a flash the two other cit men
     move to jump nico smash! the second cit man is swallowing
     his teeth fox leaps in the way of the third shoves nico
     out of the hooch 
30   ext hooch  night

     fox wrestles nico away from the hooch 

                             fox

                      as nico jerks free
               what the fucks the matter with you!!!
     nico is shaking with rage and fear he takes several steps
     away from the hooch then draws up abruptly nico pulls his
     45 from his holster pops the safety starts back for the
     hooch

     the cit man calls out to the cambodian troops in dialect
     pointing at nico the soldiers start toward nico as if to
     seize him fox too starts yelling to the troops in dialect
     apparently countermanding the orders of the cit men the
     troops confused hold up for a moment

                             fox
