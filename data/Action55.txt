               ext chicago  night to dawn

               thundering north through the glass canyons of the loop the 
               elevated train screeches through the city awakening as it 
               races north across the river past ancient factories giving 
               way to high rise splendor lights glistening against the 
               dawn we see the complex business of bringing a city to life 
               in the morning

               on the near north side an assortment of revelers are winding 
               up their night on the town

               the pressmen loiter outside the tribune loading docks and 
               fishing boats are outbound through the chicago river locks

               a streetsweeping crew moves through the fulton market 
               chicagos central meat and produce distribution center

               at the merchandise mart platform the elevated train picks up 
               two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas

               ext alley  day

               the el train rumbles north past the aging tenements of uptown 
               into the belmont avenue station

               and down below a garbage truck is slowly working its way up 
               the alley a garbage man in city overalls whistles to the 
               driver and the truck stops he rolls a can to the grinding 
               jaw as the driver sits tense and alert scanning the street

               theres something odd about this driver and the garbage man 
               too for that matter

               ext el platform  day

               spider a nervous looking black man steps out onto the 
               platform as the train pulls away we see him reach into his 
               shirt pocket and clicks his ball point pen a couple of times 
               he whispers into it it is a concealed radio transmitter

                                     spider
                         say hey cub fans i hope to hell

                         game today

               he heads for the stairs and the street below

               int truck cab  day

               the truck cab is equipped with a police radio the driver 
               rich donato adjusts the volume over the speaker heavy 
               with static we can hear the sound of the receding el train

               they also hear spiders transmitter the quality of the 
               reception improves as spider and his antennae clear the steel 
               support structure of the el platform

               set down the thermos and is nervously moving from leg to

               the resentment the other cops feel against partida is readily

               medic bandaging the wound

                                     partida

                              pointing
                         third floor rear

               grandmother

               the old lady is agitated jabbering in spanish and pointing 
               at the cops

               eddie sees this and then is pulled away as he helps one of 
               the medics lift donato and carry him to the ambulance

               eddie helps donato into the ambulance

                                     eddie

               fiveyear old chevy is wreckage the quarter panels are 
               rusted the radio antenna is a coathanger and when kosalas 
               pushes a tape into the cassette player the windshield wipers 
               start moving

               kosalas pops the cassette out the windshield wipers stop 
               he throws the cassette into the glove compartment but now 
               he cant get the door to stay closed

               eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane 
               passing directly overhead

               eddie glances at kosalas who looks uncomfortable

                                     eddie
                         you know its kind of interesting

               and now comes a mystery jet wearing no company colors 
               banking in over lake point tower and whistling low over the 
               planetarium to a touchdown

               the white learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field 
               as an undistinguished buick rolls down the ramp to meet it

               eddie and kosalas stand by their car parked across the runway

               eddie punches a button on the answering machine it spews 
               tape across the table

                                     pirelli
                         machines just dont like you

               pirelli grabs the machine unplugs it and carries it out 
               the door toward his own apartment

                                     eddie
                         maybe i dont like machines

               ext soldier field  day

               the machine in question looks like a miniature tank this is 
               the prowler a robot antiterrorist vehicle that is being 
               maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for 
               the citys law enforcement agencies

               the prowler is amazingly agile and its bullhorn voice 
               breaks everybody up

                                     voice
                              from speaker
                         arretez! halten zie! stop! do not 
                         move! no se mueve!

               the machines three video eyes searching the crowd 
               independently give it the appearance of an extraindustrial 
               bug one camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends 
               to give it the perspective of a giraffe the thing seems 
               almost alive

               commander kates is here leading a contingent of departmental 
               brass with them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of 
               city councilmen

               the prowler is being put through its paces by the factory 
               engineer he controls the machine with a pistolgrip device 
               that looks like a small tv camera

                                     engineer
                         after the gyros are locked any 
                         movement of the hand controller is 
                         duplicated by the prowler

               he turns his hand to the right and the prowler 50 yards 
               away sweeps its turret to the right aiming the twin 30 
               calibre machineguns at the politicians they move aside

                                     engineer
                         this simple control system means 
                         that even semiskilled employees can 
                         operate the unit with a minimum of 
                         training as they say even a child 
                         can operate it

               standing with chief kates eddie watches the demonstration

               eddie keeps walking seemingly oblivious to the prowler 
               suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the 
               prowlers sight

               he pops up with his gun pointed at the prowlers controller

                                     eddie

               pulls her up to his face and she stops wideeyed with terror

               samo jumps eddie and the gun goes flying it hits the 
               pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street

               in a staggering blur eddie takes out the comachos kicking 
               the last one end over end but angel and the girl have

               out onto the platform just as the train pulls to in angel 
               forces her onto the train

               eddie comes pounding up the steps and onto the platform just 
               in time to stop the closing train door with his foot

               angel spots him knife still in hand he pulls diana from 
               car to car past the terrified passengers until finally he is 
               cornered at the end of the train angel searches frantically 
               for a way out

               eddie enters diana sees him

                                     angel

               eddie takes another step

               out

               ext el train  day

               angel climbs up the back of the car onto the roof

               eddies right behind him

               the spectacular pursuit from car to car on the roof of the 
               speeding el train is witnessed by startled secondfloor 
               secretaries whose desks look directly out at the roof of the 
               passing cars

               very high angle

               angel and eddies figures appear as specks roaring through 
               the canyon of skyscrapers

               on train roof

               a low bridge forces both men to hug the roof of the train 
               eddie recovers first and grabs angel pulling him down they 
               roll from side to side on the roof nearly slipping over the 
               side with a desperate shove angel breaks free eddie points 
               his gun at him the train is now over the chicago river 
               angel dives into the water

               eddie reholsters his gun and dives in after him

               follows eddies decent with her eyes

               dozens of startled pedestrians line the bridge railing as 
               eddie swims toward angel bobbing in the middle of the stream

               a hotdogger in a speedboat is racing up the river and angel 
               is directly in his path the skipper showing off for his 
               passengers doesnt notice him until he hears the sickening 
               thunk under the keel the boats wake is suddenly red with 
               blood

               ext river bank  day

               eddie is helped from the water by a couple of passersby

               he stands there soaking wet looking around

               a crowd is gathering we hear sirens in the background then 
               he spots her

               diana is standing on the bridge watching him

               find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with eddie in 
               the other lane

               in the narrow concrete tunnel the two cars battle each other 
               like bulls in a chute each one trying to cut the other off

               circle until all the ammo is gone

               then silence

               eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg its not 
               serious

               it appears everyone is out of ammunition but a few comachos 
               are still hidden in the factory

               eddie is after them like a tiger victor shoulder still 
               bandaged never has a chance he goes down battered and 
               broken

               but luis has crept up behind eddie he jumps over a steel 
               plate hes going for diana a long knife in his hand

               eddie reaches for a reload puts it in his magnum aims and 
               blows luis away just as he reaches for diana

               int warehouse  day

               across the littered battlefield eddie escorts diana toward 
               the light streaming through the factory entrance he takes 
               off his jacket and wraps it around dianas shoulders

               ext warehouse  day

               the pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every 
               second

               a fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the prowlers 
               incendiary ammunition

               the bodies of the comachos lying everywhere astound the 
               arriving home team

               officer kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car 
               brennan and music are running down the dock donato a cast 
               on his leg hobbles after them

               ext warehouse  day

               emergency vehicles are arriving and more squad cars paddy 
               wagons and fire engines

               eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance now carrying 
               diana kates calls out after him

                                     kates
                         hey cusack!

               eddie stops slowly turns around

               there is a long pause

                                     kates
                         im glad you dont follow orders

               eddie hands diana over to the waiting medics who put her in 
               the ambulance

               we pull back further and further until we see the rest of 
               the home team the ambulance carrying diana pulls away 
               with its lights flashing

               eddie walks down the pier alone

                                         the end
