		theres an old joke  uh two elderly 
		women are at a catskills mountain 
		resort and one of em says boy the 
		food at this place is really terrible 
		the other one says yeah i know and 
		such  small portions well thats 
		essentially how i feel about life  full 
		of loneliness and misery and suffering 
		and unhappiness and its all over much 
		too quickly  thethe other important 
		joke for me is one thats uh usually 
		attributed to groucho marx but i think 
		it appears originally in freuds wit and 
		its relation to the unconscious  and it 
		goes like thisim paraphrasing uh  
		i would never wanna belong to any club 
		that would have someone like me for a 
		member thats the key joke of my adult 
		life in terms of my relationships with 
		women  tsch you know lately the 
		strangest things have been going 
		through my mind cause i turned forty 
		tsch and i guess im going through a 
		life crisis or something i dont know 
		i uh  and im not worried about aging  
		im not one o those characters you know 
		although im balding slightly on top thats 
		about the worst you can say about me  i 
		uh i think im gonna get better as i get 
		older you know  i think im gonna be the
		the balding virile type you know as 
		opposed to say the uh distinguished 
		gray for instance you know  less im 
		neither o those two unless im one o 
		those guys with saliva dribbling out of 
		his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria 
		with a shopping bag screaming about 
		socialism 
			sighing 
		annie and i broke up and ii still cant 
		get my mind around that  you know ii 
		keep sifting the pieces of the relationship 
		through my mind andand examining my life 
		and tryin to figure out where did the 
		screwup come you know and a year ago we 
		were tsch in love  you know andandand 
		 and its funny im notim not a 
		morose type  im not a depressive character  
		iii uh 
			laughing 
		you know i was a reasonably happy kid 
		i guess  i was brought up in brooklyn 
		during world war ii

int theater lobby

a linedup crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater alvy and 
annie among them  a bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing
scene

				man in line 
			loudly to his companion right 
			behind alvy and annie 
		we saw the fellini film last tuesday  
		it is not one of his best  it lacks a 
		cohesive structure  you know you get 
		the feeling that hes not absolutely sure 
		what it is he wants to say  course ive 
		always felt he was essentially aa technical 
		film maker  granted la strada was a great 
		film  great in its use of negative energy 
		more than anything else  but that simple 
		cohesive core  

alvy reacting to the mans loud monologue starts to get annoyed while annie 
begins to read her newspaper

				alvy 
			overlapping the mans speech 
		imimim gonna have a stroke

				annie 
			reading 
		well stop listening to him

				man in line 
			overlapping alvy and annie 
		you know it must need to have had its 
		leading from one thought to another  
		you know what im talking about

				alvy 
			sighing 
		hes screaming his opinions in my ear

				man in line 
		like all that juliet of the spirits or 
		satyricon i found it incredibly  
		indulgent  you know he really is  hes 
		one of the most indulgent film makers  he 
		really is

				alvy 
			overlapping 
		key word here is indulgent

				man in line 
			overlapping 
		without getting  well lets put it 
		this way 

				alvy 
			to annie who is still reading 
			overlapping the man in line who is 
			still talking 
		what are you depressed about

				annie 
		i missed my therapy  i overslept

				alvy  
		how can you possibly oversleep

				annie 
		the alarm clock

				alvy 
			gasping 
		you know what a hostile gesture that is 
		to me

				annie 
		i knowbecause of our sexual problem 
		right

				alvy 
		hey you  everybody in line at the 
		new yorker has to know our rate of 
		intercourse

		 its like samuel beckett you know
		i admire the technique but he doesnt  
		he doesnt hit me on a gut level

				alvy

				annie 
		stop it alvy!

				alvy 
			wringing his hands 
		well hes spitting on my neck!  you know 
		hes spitting on my neck when he talks

				man in line 
		and then the most important thing of all 
		is a comedians vision

				annie 
		and you know something else  you know 
		youre so egocentric that if i miss my 
		therapy you can think of it in terms of 
		how it affects you!

				man in line 
			lighting a cigarette while he talks 
		gal gunshy is what it is

				alvy
			reacting again to the man in line 
		probably on their first date right

				man in line 
			still going on 
		its a narrow view

				alvy
		probably met by answering an ad in the 
		new york review of books  thirtyish 
		academic wishes to meet woman whos 
		interested in mozart james joyce and 
		sodomy 
			he sighs then to annie 
		whatta you mean our sexual problem

		iii mean im comparatively normal 
		for a guy raised in brooklyn

				annie 
		okay im very sorry  my sexual problem!

the man in front of them turns to look at them then looks away

				alvy 
		i never read that  that wasthat was 
		henry james right  novel uh the 
		sequel to turn of the screw  my sexual 

				man in line 
			even louder now 
		its the influence of television  yeah 
		now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms 
		of it being aa high uh high intensity 
		you understand  a hot medium  as opposed 
		to a 

				alvy 
			more and more aggravated 
		what i wouldnt give for a large sock o 
		horse manure

				man in line     
		 as opposed to a print 

alvy steps forward waving his hands in frustration and stands facing the 
camera

				alvy 
			sighing and addressing the audience 
		what do you do when you get stuck in a movie 
		line with a guy like this behind you  i mean 
		its just maddening!

the man in line moves toward alvy  both address the audience now

				man in line 
		wait a minute why cant i give my opinion  
		its a free country!

				alvy 
		i mean d he can give you do you hafta

of the crowded lobby  he moves over to a large standup movie poster and 
pulls marshall mcluban from behind the poster

him

int rehearsal hall of a theater

an actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball  
they face each other  the actress resembles annie the actor alvy

				actor 
		youre a thinking person  how can you 
		choose this lifestyle

				actress 
		what is so incredibly great about new 
		york  its a dying city!  youyou read 
		death in venice

				actor 
		you didnt read death in venice till 
		i gave it to you!

				actress 
		well you only give me books with the 
		word death in the title

the camera pulls back showing alvy sitting with two men at a table set up 
near the actors  a mirror running the whole width of the wall reflects the 
two actors a script lying on the table between them  it is obvious now that 
they are rehearsing a scene that alvy wrote

				actor 
			in mirrored reflection 
		its an important issue

				actress 
			in mirrored reflection 
		alvy you are totally incapable of 
		enjoying life

the camera moves back to actual actor and actress

				actress 
		youre like new york  youre an island

				actor 
			rising with emotion 
		okay if thats all that weve been 
		through together means to you i guess 
		its better if we just said goodbye 
		once and for all!  you know its funny 
		after all the serious talks and passionate 
		moments that it ends here  in a health
		food restaurant on sunset boulevard  
		goodbye sunny

the actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair

				actress 
		wait!  imim gonna  go with you 
			the actor comes back they embrace 
		i love you

the camera cuts to alvy who turns and looks straight into the camera

				alvy 
			to the audience gesturing 
		tsch whatta you want  it was my first 
		play  you know you know how youre 
		always tryin t get things to come out 
		perfect in art because uh its real 
		difficult in life  interestingly however 
		i did run into annie again  it was on the 
		upper west side of manhattan

annie singing seems like old times  overlaps alvys speech and continues 
over the next scene where alvy standing in front of a manhattan theater 
shakes hands with annie and her escort  the theater marquee reads ophuls 
prize film the sorrow and the pity

				alvys voice
			over the theater scene and 
			annies singing 
		she had moved back to new york  she was 
		living in soho with some guy 
			laughing 
		and when i met her she was of all things 
		dragging him in to see the sorrow and the 
		pity  which i counted as a personal 
		triumph  annie and i  
			alvys voice continues over the 
			scene shot through a window of 
			manhattan cafe showing alvy and 
			annie sitting at a table laughing 
			and enjoying themselves 
		 we had lunch sometime after that and 
		uh just uh kicked around old times

a series of flashbacks following in quick succession while annie continues to 
sing

annie and alvy going up the fdr drive the day they met playing tennis annie 
driving alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich

annie and alvy in the hamptons house kitchen annie banding a live lobster to 
alvy who drops it in the pot on the stove

annie and alvy walking side by side by the shoreline

alvy at the tennis club packing his bag as he looks over his shoulder and 
sees annie hands on her face then clapping as she offers him a ride home 
in her car

annie opening the door to alvy the night he came over to kill the spider annie
and alvy in the bookstore buying the death titles annie and alvy in

house alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa annie and alvy playing 
tennis annie and alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college 
performance in annies hometown alvy bolding annie close the night he came

and continue annie carrying her luggage and clothes into alvys bedroom alvy 
following the day she first moved into his apartment  annie holding up her 
sexy birthday present from alvy then leaning over and kissing him annie and 
alvy walking down a city street holding each other close sitting on the park
bench observing the people and kissing on the fdr drive the new york city 
skyline behind them
the music stops

returning to the present the camera focusing through the cafe window shows 
annie and alvy across street  they look about at the city traffic  lunch is 
over its time

alvy and annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like  annie crosses 
the street alvy watching her go  then he turns and slowly walks down the 
street off screen  his voice is heard over the scene

				alvys voiceover 
		after that it got pretty late  and we 
		both hadda go but it was great seeing 
		annie again right  i realized what a 
		terrific person she was andand how much 
		fun it was just knowing her and ii 
		thought of that old joke you know this
		thisthis guy goes to a psychiatrist and 
		says doc uh my brothers crazy  he 
		thinks hes a chicken and uh the 
		doctor says well why dont you turn 
		him in and the guy says i would but 
		i need the eggs well i guess thats 
		pretty much how how i feet about 
		relationships  you know theyre totally 
		irrational and crazy and absurd and  
		but uh i guess we keep goin through it 
		because uh most of us need the eggs
