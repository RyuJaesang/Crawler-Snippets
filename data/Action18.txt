 in its simplest terms the end of mankind one asteroid one  
mile wide or bigger impacts the earth with the equivalent force 
of all the  nuclear weapons in the  world times a thousand half 
our population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and 
heat pulses the other half wont be so lucky in the  end it 
will be men  eating the flesh of other men 
beat
 its not the end of the  world general the world  earth  
will still be here but there will be no  life  maybe 
cockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria

off the phone  with the russians theyre just about to launch a 
new mars probe on the biggest  rocket in the world  golden and

 with the worst guidance system in the world their mars probe in  
96 was found by a pygmy tribe in africa 

temple theyre going to pull off the probe and replace it with 
four atlas  class iv nuclear warheads enough punch in their 
opinion  not to break it up   but to slow it down enough to 
miss earths orbit 

golden 
vo
 their launch date is set for next month

golden 
vo
 to when

temple sixteen hours from now

all the nasa technicians clamor at once

golden 
vo
 what are they gonna do glue spit and scotch tape it together  
even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid a surface nuclear 
detonation is not  going to work  the only way is to split the 
thing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us 

temple thank you for bringing up the impossible dan

colinswood people the presidents joining us mr president

president 
vo
 well this has been a tough day the medias all over this  
theyre going to get nothing telling the public we might all be 
dead in  eighteen days achieves nothing but panic 

golden 
vo
 mr president finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing  
to do unless you have the exact coordinates there are only 
twelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now youve 
got a full moon goin for four days   makes it all but

my sweet spot if i can get a clean hole in there shell blow in 
half 

golden and the two pieces will slide right past us you 
cannot shatter it  getting hit with 20 smaller asteroids is as 
bad as one big one you have to  drill plant the nuke  lift 
off and detonate  all before the asteroid reaches this  
position 
demonstrates position
 you have eight hours remember it you must  detonate by this 
point or  the two halves will hit us 

harry nods and walks off

sharp drill an eighthundred foot hole in eight hours is that

harry doesnt like to be questioned 

harry you just worry about getting me on that rock colonel let 
me worry  about the drilling

a moment of conflict between them

ext johnson cente  astronaut training  day

one of the armadillos complete with drilling arm sits at the 
bottom of the  tank harry and six roughnecks are already at the 
bottom in pressure suits and  helmets 

golden quincy clark sharp truman and all of the nasa 
brass observe

aj is the last to enter the tank

int nasa neutral buoyancy tank  underwater

aj descend to the tanks bottom harry chick bennie max and 
tito are in  bulky white pressure suits jimbo and bear wear the 
largest pressure suits ever  made they talk through their helmet 
radio links 

one drilling arm starts turning the roughnecks turn toward a 
stack of 20 foot  long stainless steel drilling pipes on the 
tanks bottom above water  side of  training tank

golden hits a stopwatch

golden 
into intercom
 go

int nasa neutral buoyancy tank  underwater

bear and jimbo grab a pipe string and handle onto the mockup 
drill arm they  clamp it on bennie and chick screw a drill bit 
onto the pipe string they are  good very good the work with 
the manic intensity of a pit crew at indy 

harry done!

above water  side of tank

golden hits his stopwatch smiles the nasa brass is 
impressed

golden these guys are fast harry interior gauge check

int nasa neutral buoyancy tank  underwater

harry were on aj

aj lets see what this baby can do

harry and aj move the armadillos airlock door it has an 
exterior open/close  button harry punches it the side door 
opens harry enters then aj 

int armadillo  underwater

harry and aj still underwater climb inside harry presses the 
pressurization  button simulating pressurisation in space the 
water in the cab is blown out  and air whooshes in 

harry and aj sit dripping in the watertight cab through the 
front window we  see the other roughnecks in the tank harry 
unlocks his neck seals pulls off  his helmet 

harry lose the helmet aj

aj snaps out of it his hands go instinctively to the helmet 
and in one  motionclick its off

harry 
clicks radio
 were in run the simulation

the interior pressure guge needles and monitors 
engine torque drill direction  etc
 start bobbing the drill starts to cut into a block of concrete 

golden 
vo
 hows she look

harry torque adjusters good fuel level good aj downhole 
pressure

aj we can do better im increasing the rpms to seven 
thousand we can get  more torque

golden 
vo
 negative aj dont exceed ix thousand not on this run

aj relax i built this thing shes got more in her increasing 
the rpms

golden 
vo
 negative aj aj increases the rpms the gauge starts to 
rise the nasa brass shifts  uneasily in their seats theyre 
not accoutomed to seeing their astronauts  disobey orders

contd
 aj shut the armadillo down now

aj we can push it further lets see what she can do

suddenly the rpms shoot into the red a red siren spins in the 
control room  the armadillo shakes violently the drilling bit 
grinds to nothing the  armadillo blows a tranny 

harrys eyes close hes pissed

in the control room

the nasa brass looks to golden one of them shakes their 
head sharp and  golden exchange a look sharp shakes his head 
inside the tank

aj presses a button and the cabin simulating 
depressurisation in space  begins to fill with water

everyone around him just watches as aj climbs out of the tank 
after a  minute aj looks up sees all the eyes in the room on 
him

contd
 when i was about your age i was in galveston texas i scraped  
together some money bought some old equipment a little land i 
set up a rig  and drilled my first hole then i sat there and 
watched her soak up the sun for six  months  waiting for this 
baby to pop everybody told me to quit i wouldnt  listen my 
wife ran off with a drillrigger left me with grace everybody 
in town thought i  was a fool but i stayed with it and in the 
last hour of the last day she  popped she spit out that black 
gold and i danced in it like a wild indian 
reflective 
 i  captured the magic 
holding medal

harry takes off the medal sets it on the table he grabs a 
cutting vice and  cuts the medal in two perfect halves he hands 
one half to aj

 ive been with nasa my entire adult life  eleven years as 
an astronaut another fifteen on the ground at mission control  
twentysix years ive had  to answer one question  why why 
more money why the race for  space why do we need to know what 
is up there

 when we come through  this ill take  comfort in the fact that 
i wont ever have to answer those  questions again you are our 
warriors up there you are our last hope god be  with you

freedom clears the ice boulder by a foot independence not so 
lucky clips the  ice boulder ripping her left thruster clean 
off with one thruster  independence careens out of control 
twirling and spinning

panicked
 i lost left thruster! no control! i have no control! 

in the independences cargo bay one of the armadillos rips free 
from its  moorings and plunges through the cargo bay doors

suddenly the independence with a ripped open cargo bay door 
careens directly  across freedoms path filling freedoms

hop down turning  on their progravity thrusters bear begins 
offloading 20foot long drilling  pipes 

harry takes readings from a seismic instrument pulls out a soil 
sampler a  small shovel on a telescoping shaft he digs it in

stabbing it into the ground clang  clang 

chick exchanges nervous looks with bear and max 

harry bedrock whole goddamn place is bedrock 

harry examines the ground not satisfied he finds a spot he

icy surface down  the drill pipe goes unimpeded 10 feet just 
like that it suddenly stops its  turning but not drilling 
bear and max approach the drill hole 

bear what in hells down there

harry chick bring er up!

chick throws it in reverse the drilling arm reverses out of the

harry i designed you i built you you are the enemy of all 
subterranean shit  you are the king its showtime 

harry passes it to bear who screws it onto the drilling pipe

harry approaches from the  shuttle 

harry how far 

chick almost 60 feet and startin to kick ass! 

suddenly grrrr clang bang the drill pipe stops harry walks 
over to the hole 



chick 
contd
 that did not sound good 

harry increase rpm 

chick throws the lever the drill pipe turns faster but still 
doesnt descend  harry and the guys crowd around the drilling 
hole 

max freaky man

bear i got one of those bigtime crappy feelings about this

harry we gotta get more power down to this bit 
thinks looks up at chick
  full throttle

chick you sure

harry yeah im sure

chick i dont think she can take it

harry shes gonna have to

chick the last time we ran her at full throttle we ripped her up!

harry i dont have time to argue chick now goddamn it throttle 
up or ill  come up there and do it for you

chick reluctantly throws the lever to full throttle the turbine 
engine roars  the drill pipe turns faster in the hole the 
turbine engine is shaking the  armadillo the drill pipe is 
descending again suddenly bang!! the clutch  rupture spewing 
the clutch plates and gears into space

harry stop!

chick throws it into reverse up comes the terminator chewed to 
shreds bear  and max look at it then each other very worried 
now 

bear the terminators terminated

chick the clutch is dead

harry were goin to the second rig

harry stalks off toward the shuttle

harry why dont we cut to the chase fellahs what the fuck is 
going on with  that other nuke

harry stares at the nuclear weapon

sharp stamper if you cant drill the hole were detonating this 
thing on the  surface

chick and the guys eye each other harry walks off pissed 
off

golden alarmed tries to figure out what they have

int shuttle freedom

chick bear and max enter through the airlock everyone turns and 
stares at  sharp 

sharp theres no way in hell youre gonna get that hole dug and 
you know it 

harry well it wasnt my scientists that told me about the 
fucking fire  cracker inside the hand story are we detonating on 
the surface or are we gonna  drill 

bear i didnt come up here to die 

chick i say we drill they say we have until zero barrier 

sharp 
freaked out
 that hole better be dug in two hours or were detonating  
whether youre on this godforsaken rock or not! 

harry were drilling

harry and his crew file out

int mission control  night

golden 
to temple
 what is going on up there

temple your drillers arent doing the job dan

golden after 15 minutes what do you expect

temple golden we are preparing for surface detonation

golden a surface detonation isnt going to do it general my 
scientists have  already told you that it must be detonated 
inside the asteroid the alternative  is that the earth  will be 
bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as  catastrophic 

temple stares off pensively into the sky

temple we have a lot better chance of surviving the smaller 
matter the  drillers have two hours 
to the aides
 i want you ready on my command 

the adjutants prepare the nuclear command link

military adjutant sir we have interface with the weapon remote 
detonator  standing by

demoralised

lev i feel like skywalker luke when he learn darth vader his 
father what i  should do

aj get up we got work to do

lev aj let me cash in my chips

aj lev were getting off this rock if i have to drag your ass 
the whole  way 
off levs look
 now get up! 

aj walks into the independence cargo bay detached from the 
nose section then  climbs into independences armadillo 

aj cmon lev put your weight into it!

lev is prying open the cargo bay ramp door 
the hydraulics are shot


lev you come push yankee

int  mission control

golden turns to temple

golden the asteroids surface is heating up

temple what does that mean

golden it means they may not be able to work on the surface for 
much longer  the temperatures will be unbearable 

ext independence  wreckage of cargo bay 

the armadillo engine rumbling is poised to roll independences 
long tubular  nuclear weapon which has been ejected with other 
debris from the broken  fuselage 

lev wait aj! we drive over nuclear weapon and we finished 
before we started 

aj so move it 

lev jams a pipe between the arming devic and the nuke as he 
rolls the nuke  over the arming device detaches rips off and 
clatters to the ground

a halfsmile from aj hope 

int shuttle freedom 

sharp comes back from the cockpit carrying the detonator 
harrys on the phone  to golden 

harry you told me that the only way to deal with this hunk o 
crud is to  get a nuke 1000 feet down you sticking with that 

golden 
vo
 firmly 

harry great glad we have that understanding 

golden 
vo
 if youre gonna pull this off we have to have a little talk  
about timeand temperature zero barriers in two hours 

harry waitwaitwhat about temperature when did temperatures 
come into the  picture 

golden 
vo
 harry your suits are good upto 150 degrees celsius 

harry and how hot is it going to get 

golden 
vo
 we didnt anticipate you being on the asteroid so long the  
clock is ticking 

harry how hot is it going to get! 

golden 
vo
 three hundred and fifty degrees 

harrys face drops 

harry thanks for telling us now goldeni dont think my bits 
can handle  those kind of temperatures 

int freedom  cargo bay 

harry clicks off the radio 

watts weve still gotta fix this shuttle stamper 

harry give me some more good news youve got two new assistants 
who can fix  your shuttle bear max hop to it theres not a 
machine they cant fix we can  handle the hole from here

harry colonel sharp if were going to blow this hole you gotta 
help me i  need some more manpower

ext freedom drill site  minutes later

wth three spires  directly in front of them the sun is moving 
over the asteroids far horizon  causing a sunrise it is 
breathtaking spiritualand frighteningly bright

aj over the hill

suddenly the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply aj stops

the ground around the vehicle heaves up and down the ground 
splits one  tectonic plate rises 15 feet in the air the ground 
breaks like a wave up and  down

here too the ground shakes bear terrified drops a drill 
pipe max is shaken  to the ground

stops all is  stll

 lets take a look

lev gets out he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of 
the fissure 

lev this bad 
repeating mantra
 darth vader darth vader 

aj listen mr negative everyone thinks were dead were not 
so suck it  up because if we dont drill that hole six billion 
people are going to die  and im not lettin harry stamper get 
all the freaking credit for saving the world 
firm
  were gona do this then were going home 

lev i love this american confidence! like john wayne 
sotto
 this why i  suspect you won cold war 

aj hep me get these rocks over there 

aj and lev start dragging rocks to use as a kicker ramp for 
the jump lev is  oblivious they pull embedded rock out 
revealing diamonds aj holds up a  large chunk

holding chunk
 with this i can rebuild my mir

aj is walking along the gaping jagged fissure 50 feet wide 
50 feet deep  stretching across the entire slope 

lev this bad this very bad very very bad 

aj stick a cork in it lev im tryin to think 

aj stares at the fissure his eyes roaming from the 
fissureto the  armadilloback to the fissure 

aj 
contd
 hop on the back get our weight distributed better 

lev 
uncertain
 and why to do this 

aj because im askin and turn your suits thrusters off 
trust me okay 

aj gets in the armadillo lev goes around back climbs on the 
rear bumper he  clicks off his pressure suits progravity 
thrusters 

lev okeydoke 

the armadillo begins backing down the slope

aj throws it in neutral the armadillo stops 

aj hey lev were gonna see what this porche engine can do 

he throws it in drive the armadillo lurches ahead 

ext ajs armadillo  back bumper 

the armadillos rear tires churn forward slinging rocks and 
gravel which in  zerog shoot off in a stream into space never 
falling lev holds on for dear  life

it ascends and amazingly  shoots across the entire 50 foot 
expanse of jagged fissure

suspended in zerog on its side and in midair the armadillo is 
pushed by  thrusters tiresfirst against the sheer 90 degree 
cliff face next to the  slope all four armadillo tires slam 
against the cliff the armadillo bounces  off 

lev grabbing the armadillos towing cable flies off the rear 
the cable spools  out and lev hanging on for all hes worth 
slams against the cliff face and  descends

stop

theres no time

with an awesome force the drilling hole blows the drilling pipe 
explodes  upward lifting the drilling arm and the entire

max punches the door lock without depressurising the cabin and is 
sucked  violently out of the rear compartment into open space 

ext space over asteroid surface 

fifty feet of drill pipe the drilling arm and the entire 
armadillo rig with  max trailing blows into space maxs face is 
a screaming mask of terror and  confusion reaching out but 
theres no one to catch himharry and the guys  watch in 
helpless silence as the drill rig and max ascend into space

skip they just lost the rig the hole blew out 

golden takes the news stoically he thinks looking across the 
room at temple  he looks at the clock one hour and forty 
minutes to go 

golden say nothing

silence a stark tableau harry and the men standing there just 
watching  devastated confused in shock this is a total 
catastrophe the mission is  over 

sharp nods to pitts pitts picks up the remote nuclear detonator 

sharp stamper you ready to blow this lets get outta here! 

harry ignores him he wont accept defeat 

harry chick get your butt over here 

chick drags his ass over to harry 

chick yeah 

harry were gonna fix this  make it work if we weld those two 
together and  go in one speed 

chick harry 

harry get your ass up here! 

chick doesnt move the two men stare at each other 

chick ive been with you fourteen years ive never said this to 
you never  thought i would its over 

chick walks off toward the shuttle bear joins him 

harry atop of the armadillo looks around his head dropshes 
burning up  his fist clenches the half medallion in his hand 
where is it  clipped to suit   in pouch of suit
 his eyes shut tightly he is going to will victory from  defeat 
he will not give up 

cameras at low angle giving harry a largerthanlife look 

harry hears something a low rumble it is confusing it sounds 
likean  armadillo engine 

harry opens his eyes he slowly turns and looks  

across the valley  on the distant ridge  the front bumper of 
ajs armadillo  inches over the ridge crest 

harry for the first time on the asteroid smiles miracles do 
happen 

harry chickbear!!! 

chick and bear about ready to enter the freedoms airlock stop 
and turn they  see ajs armadillo roaring down the hillside 
onto the drilling site 

ext freedom  drilling site 

aj and lev roar up to the drilling site in the independences 
armadillo they  come down a hill spectacularly without brakes 
and it piles into shit knocking  things down 

lev and aj bounce up to chick and bearhugs and highfives 
go around 

bear aj frost back from the dead 

chick now you can die with us 

harry all the bits are gone aj ive been inventing drill bits 
for  twentyfive years and i dont know what to use 

aj you wouldnt happen to need a diamond tipper would you 

aj pulls out the pouch of diamonds found on the ridge 

harry boys were back in business!

golden stares at the wall grace is curled up on a chair in the 
corner 

harry 
vo
 we have good news folks aj and the russian just showed up no  
other survivors 

grace shuts her eyes smiling sobbing 

ext shuttle freedom  afternoon 

chick shuts off an arc welder and moves aside letting harry view 
a drill bit  with ajs diamonds mounted on the top like 
diamonds in a ring setting harry  and the guys smile

the newly created drill bit lowers into the drilling hole and 
begins turning it  chews into the shit down below whirring and 
ripping anddescends quickly 

chick it worked! shes goin through her like a hot knife through 
butter!

harry we gotta do 180 in thirty minutes 

chick downhole pressures goin through the roof! 

harry stop! shut down

harry got to kid no choice 

aj drill right through the pressure to pay dirt 

harry thats crazy 

aj sometimes crazy works 

harry and aj stare at each other 

harry chick ajs callin this one 

aj full throttle! 

chick throws the lever the drill pipe descends on full throttle

graph shows the  drilling progress 

flip nine hundred and eightynine ninetytheyre into the

golden looks at the clock thirtyone minutes to go he twists 
his wedding ring 



golden now just get the thing in the hole 

all the technicians stare at their monitors the atmosphere is 
thick with  tension clark chews his nails

the armadillo  safely away from the site 

watts and sharp roll a gurney containing the nuclear device 
a massive stainless  steel tube
 down freedoms cargo bay ramp toward the hole harry and all the  
roughnecks stand by the hole 

harry one thousand feet 

chick 
smiles
 thousand and three harry with a half hour to spare 

sharp and watts roll the nuclear device gurney past the 
roughnecks up to the  drilling hole 

harry get the pipe and bit outta there 

chick gets inside the armadillo grabs the stickshift 
compresses the clutch  and throws it in reverse 

the drill pipe begins to reverse out of the hole 

int nasa  mission control 

skip shes gettin hotter! gotta mean gas  methane helium 
probably water  vapor 

ext asteroid surface  drilling site 

the drill pipe turns sloely retracting from the hole bear atop 
the drilling  platform is working on something with a wrench 

bear accidently drops his wrench it falls on the turbines 
ripped mesh  protective screen and hangs there bear looks at it 
nervously and reachesthe  wrench falls into the turbine 
spinning at sixthousand rpm with a grinding  squeal the 
wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and  

the drilling arm reverses speeds and violently thrusts the pipe 
forward  buckling it a piece of the drill string is blown out 
smashing into sharps  helmet spiderwebbing his faceshield 
hes out cold 

harry and the guys dive away from the hole chick confused 
works the clutch  furiously to no avail the drilling arm rams 
the pipe back down the hole where  it buckles bends and breaks 
in half 

tito tends to sharphis face has lost all color harry 
approaches the hole  looks down fifty feet down is a mess of 
mangled pipe blocking the hole 

int nasa  mission control  day 

golden continues looking at the thermal imaging 

golden harry cmon we got thirty minutes 

ext asteroid surface  drilling site 

harry well dan youre just going to have to goddamn wait cause 
we gotta big  problem up here in hell 
turns to guys
 somebodys gotta go down there 

chick dont look at me 

bear i cant even get my foot in there 

harry turns and eyes aj    aj stares down the hole 

harry do or die kid 

close on aj as he peers into the hole 

aj something ive been meaning to talk to you about when this 
is all over  and were back home id like to marry your 
daughter 

harry stares at aj the look priceless 

aj 
contd
 maybe ill ask her again later 

harry turns aroundlooking up at the starfilled sky aj walks

 oh yeah golden 

golden 
vo
 go ahead harry 

harry your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill 
string 

golden is he alright 

harry i hope so hes gotta get us off this shithole 

int drilling hole 

aj tied to a safety tether comes down the hole with a hand
held cutter and a  length of rope he reaches the obstruction 
the drill pipe has been mashed  bent buckled severed ends stab 
into the sides of the hole aj starts cutting  with the hand
held cutter 

ext drilling hole 

the guys stand there watching nothing happens agonising 
seconds pass  suddenly the ground rumbles another earthquake 
it slowly starts to subside 

int drilling hole 

the hole shakes aj freezes sweating 

harry 
vo
 aj we need you i need everything you got 

aj wrestles with the severed pipes untangling them tying the 
rope to them  he gives the rope a tug chick and bear above 
pull up the broken pipes 

ext drilling hole 

sharp enter interface with the weapon 

pitts clicks a six digit code into a digital pad on the devices

pitts device armed 

the nuclear device has a small sled with ratchet wheels to let it 
slide down the  hole slowly sharp and watts lift one end of the 
gurney the nuclear device  slides off the gurney toward the 
mouth of the drilling hole 

nt nasa  mission control  day 

the thermal and seismic sensors being transmitted from freedom 
start going crazy 



skip its a mess up there! 

ext asteroid surface  drilling site 

another temblor hits the worst yet 97 on earth watts falls 
losing her grip  on the gurney her end collapses the nuclear 
device lurches sideways off the  gurney and rolls away from the 
drilling hole 

the nuclear device slides off the gurney 

int drilling hole 

aj experiences the deepest most sinister rumble yet emanating 
form the  asteroids core something from hell theres a 
horrendous whooshing sound 

a windstorm of pebble like a blowing tornado whooshes up from 
the hole  smashing into ajs faceshield 

ext asteroid surface  drilling site 

everyone whirls around in the sounds direction as  

across the valley floor  a 100 foot methane geyser erupts 
spewing a plume of  hideous greenish gas into space then another 
200 feet high! another 500 feet  high! the asteroid has become 
alive the geysers eruptions loosen the  asteroids surface 
material and  

int drilling hole 

aj this sucks 

aj is whooshed violently out of the hole 

ext asteroid surface  drilling site 

pebbles and hot steam blasts from the drilling hole everyone 
recoils 

harry get back!! 

aj shoots out of the pipe tethering the safety line behind 
him blowing into  space the safety tether snaps and rips off 
aj is 70 feet off the surface  harry dives for his ripped 
tether catching it inches before ajs thrown into  space 

harry and bear grab ajs safety tether and begin to pull him 
down chick  stares at something os his jaw drops 

chick this thing definitely doesnt like us 

chunks of the asteroid some as big as trucks others as big as 
houses dislodge  from the asteroid surface and slowly at first 
but with terrifyingly increasing  speed and momentum 

 they start rolling 

harry and the guys just stand there disbelieving what theyre 
seeing 

on come the rocks and ice chunks rolling as they hit smaller 
surface rocks  they take little hops and bigger hops until 
they are bounding across the  surface harry lashes ajs tether 
to the armadillo 

harry and the guys run for their lives 

in the midst of this  

 a 500 foot high geyser erupts next to the drilling hole pitts 
gets blasted  by the geyser which blows him across the asteroid 
floor slamming him into the  parked armadillo a boulder rolls 
at pitts and squashes him against the  armadillo  killing him 

a 20 foot ice boulder rolls toward ajs safety tether 

aj suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface looks down at 
the oncoming ice  boulder aj terrified tries to unbuckle the 
tether but he cant in time 

the boulder hits ajs tether rolling over it flattening it to 
the asteroid  surface which causes  

aj with a jolt to be yanked toward the surface aj 
scrambles with his  safety harness 

chick next to the armadillo sees ajs plight he dives 
inside engages the  gears the armadillo roars toward the 
oncoming ice boulder 

aj terrified continues to descend as  

chick driving the armadillo rams the ice boulder just as its 
about to roll  over aj the boulder hops up smashes down on the 
armadillos hood crushing  the steel compartment around chick 
and gently rolls over onto  

aj who logrolls under the armadillo as the ice boulder 
whomps down and  keeps rolling 

the nuclear device is rolling across the asteroids surface 
pebbles and debris  clanging off the devices remote 
detonator 

harry bounds toward the armadillo the largest jagged rock rolls 
at the  vehicle harrys caught theres no place to turn the 
rocks rolls straight at  him twenty feet10 feetharry 
falls heavily to the ground 

harry gets up and dives down inside a foxhoesized indentation 
in the asteroid  surface 

the boulder rolls right over him 

finally the quake stops the situation stabilises everyone gets 
to their feet  harry and aj get up they look off at  

the massive boulders rolling away in the distance smashing into 
other rock  formations 

harry picks up a diamond it sparkles in the light chick grabs 
one holds it  up marvelling at it the massive boulders rolling 
away in the distance  smashing into other rock formations 

harry picks up a diamond it sparkles in the light chick grabs 
one holds it  up marvelling at it 

sharp with bruises on his face looks through his cracked 
faceshield down at  pitts corpse 

sharp hes dead 

harry put it down chick 

chick tosses down the diamond and follows harry everyone checks 
themselves  looks at others theres no talk no time to lose 
they reconvene by the  nuclear device its dented the 
alumniium gurney is smashed mangled 

sharp three on that side the rest over here 

they hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole 
they plug one  end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the 
other the nuke begins to  insert down the hole suddenly sharp 
tries to grab a tubular piece of aluminium  from the broken 
gurney 

sharp

 stop! 

 rams it into the wheels of the nukes ratchetwheel delivery

looks up
 itll have to be manually  detonated 

chick whats that mean 

pause 

harry means one of us aint leaving 

int nasa  mission control 

golden addresses the room 

golden the situation the hole is drilled but the remote 
detonator is not  functional one of the crew is going to stay 
behind and
deep breath
  manually detonate the device 

golden looks over at grace she is stunned the news is just 
sinking in 

golden dont stay for this 

grace im not leaving

 that means we might die too
