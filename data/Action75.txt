               turns the latch the store is filled with latin american 
               folk art particularly masks which line the walls

               betty stone the woman hull saw with elias at the bar comes 
               out from the back she is 27 a bad girl trying to dress the 
               way she thinks a banker who went to vassar dresses for 
               success shes also a little strung out

               she and hull recognize each other at once a brief reprise 
               of that moment of perfect chemistry but she avoids his gaze

                                     elias

               look at him opens the satchel begins a quick count she 
               does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test 
               scores

                                     hull
                         so hows this place work

               betty doesnt answer so elias covers the awkwardness

                         betty wires the money to a store in 
                         aruba in payment for things they 
                         never sent her they deposit the 
                         money in a bank there that turns 
                         around and loans her money she never 
                         has to repay that way it doesnt 
                         turn up as income for the irs welcome

                         she doesnt trust you

               hull has taken down a mask puts it over his face looks in 
               a mirror

                                     hull
                         how much is this

                                     mccutcheon
                         more than you can afford

                                     hull
                         ill take it

               she produces a vial of coke looks questioningly at elias

                                     elias
                         by all means

               she draws out six lines elias does two

                                     mccutcheon
                              offering him the 
                              straw
                         come on eddie 2 youre up

                                     hull
                         no thanks

               note betty is acutely attuned to hull and in his refusal 
               she senses  albeit unconsciously  two things first 
               that he doesnt trust himself on drugs therefore hes a 
               dangerous guy and therefore exciting and second more 
               important the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence 
               and danger and thus a longing for goodness despite the 
               seeming contradiction she finds this even more attractive 
               but because she feels herself to be bad his goodness seems 
               only a judgment against her and so she thinks she hates 
               him

                                     mccutcheon
                         who is he my mother

                              smiles
                         never have never will

               betty ignores him does her lines

               a funeral tafts wife and children from the wallet photo 
               leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party

               pocket he removes the four bloodsoaked bills his father 
               gave him and wedges these among the stems of flowers that 
               already cover the plot

               hes silent a moment then he gets up he joins carver whos 
               standing with hulls children the kids each take his hand 
               they walk together

                         you fuck up i want you to stay away 
                         from her altogether

                         black man and a nigger

               carver smiles shakes his head he likes a good joke hull 
               punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees

                                     hull

                         about doing what you tell him

               he walks away still on his knees doubled over carver 
               whispers after him

                                     carver
                         dont blow your cover
