           idiots shit they got three different
           types of csi on tv just laying out
           how the police do their businessand
           still idiots like you think you can
           just go out and do a murder yourself
                          beat
           if you wanna be a millionaire you
           gotta think like one and
           millionaires dont kill people
           they hire assassins which i did
           we gotta pay him on tuesday
                         
                          jay
           what why would you do that
                         
                          dwayne
           i was presented with an opportunity
           i took it 100 thousand bucks for a
           highly trained assassin is a steal
                         
                          jay
           but we dont have that kinda money
                         
                          dwayne
           now were addressing the real problem
           how do we get the 100 grand cause
           once we get that we get the million
                          more
           19
                         
                          dwayne contd
           and once we get the million we will
           literally own this town and every
           single thing in it
                         
                          jay
           i guess we could justrob a bank
           one of these local banks with nothing
           but a dipshit security guard
                         
                          dwayne
           again not quite thinking like a
           millionaire
                         
                          jay
           okay then lets hire someone to rob
           a bank
                         
          dwayne thinks about this for a second
                         
                          dwayne
           fuck hiring them we could just force
           someone to rob a bank for us like
           with blackmail or death threats or 
                         
                          jay
                          almost involuntarily
           a bomb everyones scared of a bomb

           im pretty sure this is exactly how
           a millionaire would do it and the
           beauty of it is we dont lose any
           sleep cause no one gets hurt
                         
                          jay
           except the major

           yeah the major dies but no one
           gets hurt
                         
          dwayne smiles but a nagging thought interrupts him 
           20
                         
                          dwayne

           connection to us

          with its own bomb vest sits on a tree stump 20 yards away
          dwayne mimes answering a phone

          dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at wills feet
          jay jumps backward as does will who hits the hood of his
          car slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side
                         
                          dwayne
           be careful!
                         
          will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
          car adjusting to the weight of the bomb as he starts the
          engine and backs away 
                         
                          dwayne

           what the hell dwayne you told me
           that was a replica gun

           especially not with the bomb around!
                         
          dwayne gets right in jays face the plastic eyes of his
          mask betray no emotion

           customer walks in and says he wants a
           tan that just means he wants a tan
           but if he says he wants a deluxe
           tan that means a blow job and you
           gotta get one of the girls in there
           to suck him off you with me

           and i was smoking a ton of weed and
           listening to the wu tang clan all the
           time and that i needed some extra
           dough to indulge my habit which in
           hindsight was probably just a cry
           for help but you never even noticed

           i shouldnt have stolen the ball i
           knew it was wrong and i regretted it
           like the next day i actually tried
           to buy it back but the guy wanted
           twice as much i had to smoke even
           more weed just to get past the whole
           shitty incident i guess thats why
           they call it a downward spiral
                         
                          chet

           the monopoly game at mcdonalds i
           musta come here three times a day
           trying to collect all the game pieces
           packed on 20 pounds got acne from
           all the grease the major said i was
           the fattest ugliest 13yearold he
           ever laid eyes on but i didnt care
           i just wanted to win the money and
           get the fuck out of there so one
           night i followed this skinny register
           kid home jumped him i kept whaling
           on him asking him where they were
           hiding the park place piece the
           million dollar prize but he didnt
           know shit a year later the major
           won the lotto i asked him for a
           sega genesis he bought me one of

           our backs  and this is just a guess 
           burn our bodies
                         
                          dwayne

           and in this case so do we

          before dwayne can react he stops and blinks something
          shining in his eyes
                         
                          jay
           heyon your forehead
                         
          dwaynes eyes turn upward just barely making out the red
          dot that dances on his forehead
                         
                          dwayne
           son of a bitch well played
                         
          in the bushes hidden from sight chet carefully aims his
          laser pointer at dwaynes forehead
                         
          will grins at dwayne

           vaughn os
           hold the fuck up
                         
          vaughn emerges from the darkness he looks at will
                         
                          vaughn
           wasnt expecting to see you here
                         
          without warning vaughn cracks will over the head with the
          butt of his gun he goes down hard kate screams vaughn
          points the gun at her and she shuts up
                         
          dwayne steps forward with the bag
                         
                          dwayne

          gun at him
                         
                          dwayne

           i just paid you
                         
          kate looks on terrified an unconscious will at her side
                         
          vaughns eyes burn a hole through dwayne
                         
                          vaughn
           ive been hit with a pipe shot with a
           pen and wasted my whole motherfucking
           dayall because of you and this job

           two loose ends in the gorilla masks
                         
                          dwayne
           im not a loose end!
                         
                          vaughn
           youre a fucking idiot you are as
           loose as ends get
                         
          panicked dwaynes eyes flash over to jay who tightens his
          grip on the flamethrower handle jay catches dwaynes eye
          dwayne nods vaughn sees this
           101
                         
                          vaughn
           what the 
                         
          jay rears up with the flamethrower vaughn couldnt be more
          surprised to see the device jay is holding spit a massive
          ball of fire at him
                         
          vaughn dives to the ground fires off two wild shots one of
                         which 
                         
          nails dwayne in the shoulder spinning him backward and
          knocking him off his feet
                         
          kate recoils in horror as vaughn scurries madly on the
          ground intermittently firing while jay screams and tries
          to torch him with the 25foot flame a hand touches kates
          shoulder and she whirls around to find 
                         
                          kate
           chet! what are you doing here!
                         
                          chet
           not now we gotta take off
                          looks around
           wheres will
                         
          kate looks to the empty spot beside her where will just was
                         
          flames inches from him vaughn lines up a desperate shot 
                         
          good news the bullet only grazes jays side bad news it
          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack
          which happens to be filled with gasoline which happens to
          have an incredibly low flash point so the spark from say
          a bullet would cause
                         
          an eruption of flames
                         
          meanwhile will pops up behind chet and kate clutching the
          garbage bag
                         
                          will
           i got the money lets get the fuck
           out of here
                         
          they take off toward wills car
                         
          dwayne groggily comes tono sound just a ringing the
          first thing he sees vaughn storming toward him godknows
          what spewing from his mouth vaughn levels his gun 
                         
          it doesnt make a sound for two reasons the second being
          that its out of bullets
                         
          dwayne fumbles for his own hardware muzzle flash
           102
                         
          vaughn drops to his knees pulse snatched from him
                         
          sound slams back to the tune of jays screams dwayne looks
          over to see his friend in flames flailing his arms and
          shrieking dwaynes head snaps to the other side where he
          sees the mustangs tires peel he tears off his mask
          frantically looks around the money is gone
                         
                          dwayne
           no!!
                         
          jay disentangles himself from the backpack the source of
          the flames but his clothes are now ablaze in his frenzy
          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words 
                         
                          jay
           dwayne! help!
                         
          dwayne gets to his feet as the mustang roars down the
          driveway he looks to jay then to his minivan dwaynes
          face two roads diverge in a wood which to take
                         
                          dwayne
           goddamn it jay!
                         
          dwayne sprints over to jay rips off his jacket and uses it
          to beat the flames down
                         
                          dwayne
           stop drop and roll!
                         
          jay hits the deck dwayne continues fighting the flames
          finally falls on top of jay with the jacket spread and
          smothers the last of them out
                         
          jay looks up at dwayne with puppy dog eyes
                         
                          jay
           you came back for meyou said you
           never would
                         
                          dwayne
           you didnt hesitate back there jay
           you did good
                         
          jay smiles flames overtake the field all around them
                         
                          dwayne
           im gonna go put a bullet in that
           motherfucker and get our money
           think you can get outta here
                         
                          jay
           yeah go get him
           103

          side is filled with 
                         
          a lofi 2001style light tunnel it deposits us in the
          furthest reaches of the galaxy where we find 
                         
          a tanning bed rotating in orbit dwaynes voice booms and
                         reverberates
