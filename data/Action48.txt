titles over yellow background
we pull back to reveal were looking at the sun in the
distance lie the gorgeous san gabriel mountains and the
downtown los angeles skyline
in one long tracking shot we crane past some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of brentwood
homeowners walk dogs a paperboy chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike its early in the morning and the
landscapers havent come with their leaf blowers yet
continue booming down to road level to face    the resplendent
martin residence we steadicam down the fr    ont walk able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black e   scalade in the
driveway to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads the martins  and we    pass through the
keyhole into the foyer

int jessicas house  morning
we track through the living room passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy and we hear a womans voice as
she comes down the stairs with a golden retriever at her
side

                     woman
               into phone

kitchen unable to see her face

straighten a photograph of her son on the fridge as she
talks

                    woman contd
          and promise her shes about to have
          a woooonnderful labor

housekeeper enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket
they give each other a silent wave

                    woman contd

she hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we come
around to finally reveal jessica martin slightly weary but
ready for the day ahead

                      rosario
           good morning miss jessica
jessica sees her answering machine blinking hits play
in the background a cheerful rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry

                 male voice
           on machine
           honey honey wake up   pick up the
and as she brings the coffee cup to her lips
slamm!! the door explodes open and a squad of five gunmen
storm in wearing skimasks everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts noise and confusion
jessicas dog starts to lunge at the men and  thup!  is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark
rosario runs for the alarm system 

                     lead gunman

and as the answering machine fills the silence

                craig vo

the lead gunman spins around and we push into the blackness
of his masked face

ext kidnappers safehouse  day
the blackness of a black van and escalade passing below us
we quickly crane down to see the vehicles traveling through
an iron gate at the edge of an aband9ned property they
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees
angle on the kidnappers van as it arrives at its
destination an isolated house in the hills the grass is
dead the trees are dead its the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing
as the van stops

                                     we push into its doors

int darkened attic  kidnappers safehouse
a door crashes open light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty skeletal interior jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor with bound hands she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see

the lead skimasked kidnapper
standing in front of her    sturdier than the rest   solid
imposing

                     jessica
          wh what do you want
unsettlingly the kidnapper says nothing staring at her
jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze
then suddenly the kidnapper turns and exits the room
jessica breathes a sigh of reliefbut it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later  with a baseball bat
grim as death he stalks toward her 

                       jessica contd
          no wait
and reachingher he hauls back and swings 

                     jessica contd

          no!   please//
smash! the bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
jessicas head obliterating the rotary dial telephone that
hung there
as phone guts shower down on her the lead kidnapper turns
and stomps away slamming the attic door shut and locking
jessica in the darkness
only now that theyre gone does jessica allow her fear to
show through trembling tears running down her face
jessica finally breaks down pleading to the empty attic



                       jessica contd
            wha what the hell is happening!
the attics suffocating silence is the only answer she gets

     footage rolls of six guiltylooking cops testifying in court
     being led away in handcuffs

                 came down this afternoon in the
                 23rd precinct corruption scandal
                 though the names of six police
                 officers were read aloud the
                 district attorney stated that this
                 was merely the tip of the iceberg
                 and that unfortunately many other
                 arrests are likely to be coming as
                 the investigations proceed

     members are bumrushed into the room by a squad of cops in
     riot gear the screaming is deafening

                to do!
     just then ryan rounds a corner  and sees traffic gridlocked
     to a halt ahead he tries to maneuver around it but is
     almost immediately boxed in

     the phone starts a steady beeping now dying imminent and
     traffic isnt going anywhere ryan looks around desperately
     nothing no emergency lane no shoulder just a long drop
     down a hill to a strip mall below
     strip mall! ryan scans it and does a doubletake on one of
     the stores signs verizon wireless
     traffic inches forward now he sees an offramp a quarter
     mile ahead  but at this rate itll take forever to make it
     there

     and with that ryan cranks the steering wheel hard right and
     hits the gas!   despite other drivers protests the little
     rentacop vehicle blasts across the gridlock tears through
     the rusty guard rail and  vroooom!  flies off the side of
     the hill!
     ryan lets out a frightened yell as he sails through the clear
     blue sky

                          ryan

                hoooollyyy shiiii
     thump! the rentacop car touches down on a steep downslope
     ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile
     miraculously avoiding the minefield of rocks and tree stumps
     he needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
     antenna in his teeth
     theres so much noise the only thing jessica could possibly
     hear is a cacophony of noise and ryan hyperventilating

                           jessica vo
                whats going on!

                           ryan
                     with phone in teeth
                mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!
     ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until
     the car hits a jutting rock and  whoooom!  goes up on two
     wheels it looks like its going to roll but gravity brings



                                                               38

     across the car!

                             ryan contd
                shit!
     ryan scrabbles for the phone  but gives it up when he
     bounces over a rise and sees a billboard dead ahead!

                             ryan contd

                whoaaaaaa!
     ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the
     billboards concrete posts but  wham!  obliterates the
     rentacops bubble lights on the billboards lower edge
     somehow ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the
     rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot where
     it skids out

                      ryan contd
                grabbing phone
                jessica! can you hear me!

      bike messenger waiting for a package as craig and the dirty
      cops enter brushing right past him
      craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter
      desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally he
      ignores ryan completely whose face is mostly hidden by the
      tinted plastic visor attached to the helmet
      craig notices an aging security guard stationed in the area
      but knows better than to make any waves

      ryan watches greer out of the corner of his eye as hodges and
      craig disappear inside the vault

      theres an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office
      one plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice
      envelopes another bin is overflowing with small mailers
      computer disks unlabeled video tapes etc

                           mailroom supervisor
                help yourself
      hodges cautiously watches craig shuffle through the mailers
      opening two or three before finding  he turns one upside
      down  and a dvd case slides out!
      a quick glance at the label adt digital surveillance

                this is it
      hodges seems uncomfortable with the supervisor hovering over
      his shoulder

                lets go

                you believe this everyones got
                their head up their ass over there
      the mail clerk ignores him almost as much as greer wants to
      greer opens his cellphone to make a call but when the signal
      is no good he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
      at the end of the hall

                          mail clerk
                    impatiently
                sir you think you could just go
                outside and get your clipboard
      just then hodges and craig come marching out of the vault

                            mail clerk contd
                sir
      ryan glances at greer momentarily distracted on the phone
      at hodges almost out of the bank as he and craig near the
      door 



                                                                  75

      a moment where craig finally locks eyes with ryan  and
      suddenly realizes this is the guy!

      ryan stands and unable to find anything better snatches a
      metal hand truck sitting by the door and as hodges walks by

                           mail clerk

                 what are you doing!

      no wait! greer turns and sees a large aluminum chute that
      leads from the roof and elbows down toward a dumpster on
      ground level



                                                                      78

      greer peers down the chute for long secondsbut nothing can
      be seen from this angle it all falls to blackness

      the alarm stops
      greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence the only
      sounds are incoherent screams coming from the stairwell he
      eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster thinks

      to be as still as possible every slight movement makes the

      from his shirt pocket jessicas tiny desperate voice pleads

      the sweat from his hands causes the tiniest slip  and as he
      catches himself there is a soft metallic boooong from the
      stressed metal
      unable to ignore her pleas any longer ryan carefully pulls
      the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear
      desperate to console her ryan 
      bang!! the tarpaper roll flies down the chute ryan looks
      up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
      he has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit      he presses
      himself to one side but

             responds to his fist flashes toward her throat making her

             fingers around her throat almost daring her to stop him
             jessica trembles but that is all and just as deason begins
             to enjoy his work jessica jabs at his face but he predicted
             as much and easily moves to deflect it  snickk!  she
             flicks her wrist up and slices the underside of his upper
