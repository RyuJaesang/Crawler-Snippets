               fade in

               ext forest  day

               distant gun and mortar fire

               muffled by the wet green forest

               the very earth seems to tremble

               a rabbit

               darts out of a log lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs 
               the air

               lobbed grenade explodes

               voices and shouts closer now mix with the rumbling war 
               sounds in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion

               a dead american gi lays splayed out careless in death

               a pair of soldiers flash among the trees running hunched 
               over and low and disappear into the gray blooms of smoke

               for a moment the forest takes a breath

               nothing but trembling leaves then  the rattle of a jeep 
               coming closer in fits and starts grinding through low gears

               a willys mb appears crashing through the undergrowth

               its driven by private first class kelly ernswiler

               eighteen if that not much meat on him his insignias 
               indicate hes in the 29th infantry

               his face might be attractive under other conditions

               he pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his m41 standard
               issue field jacket

                                     kelly
                         where the hell are those krauts

               to give himself courage he sings tommy dorseys ill be 
               seeing you [in all the old familiar places] while maneuvering 
               the jeep through the bushes and rocks

               he drives straight for a fallen log guns the engine and 
               tries to go over it

               the jeeps front wheels catch on the log

               the back tires spin

               kelly gets out takes off his m1 combat helmet and wipes his 
               face assesses the situation

               he grabs a branch jams it under the wheel trying to lever

               the jeep free when 

               the stutter of a nearby machine gun startles him

               the branch snaps against kellys weight he slips and falls 
               in the mud

                                     kelly
                         shit

               determined he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on 
               foot through the forest

               ext clearing

               kelly strides purposefully out of the woods pauses against 
               a splitrail fence beneath the innocent sun

               across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned barn

               but not for long as two german infantrymen appear around 
               the corner of it

               kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation

               unaware the germans smoke and talk kellys too far away to 
               hear them but he watches their every move

               theyre relaxed not as on guard as they should be their 
               karabiners rest slung across their backs

                                     kelly
                         bingo

               against the tree

               kelly focuses himself

               then he shoulders his carbine

               pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly

                                     kelly
                         and so they buried hector breaker 
                         of horses

               he takes his smith & wesson 1917 pistol from his pistol belt 
               and steps out into the sunlight field in plain sight of the 
               guards

               surely he knows they can see him he must want them to see 
               him

               but they dont too busy passing nudie wallet photos

               halfway across the open grass kelly raises the pistol but 
               does not aim it

               just strides steadily closer arms spread out making himself 
               an easy target

               crazy as it seems private kelly ernswiler is trying to get 
               himself killed

               ext barn

               kelly pauses not twenty feet from the germans fires into 
               the air and waves 

                when from behind him comes a voice

                                     german officer
                              os
                         eine maus findet den kase

               kelly whips around to face a third german the officer

               his pistol points right into the officers shocked pink young 
               face point blank range

               only  kelly doesnt fire

               he just lowers the pistol

               the german smiles

                                     kelly
                         kill me adolf

                                     german officer
                         mien prisoner!

               the infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come 
               running

               one of them yanks kellys hands behind his back and pushes 
               him into the barn roughly

               kelly doesnt struggle

                                     kelly
                         hey siegfreid and roy what are you 
                         waiting for kill me

               int barn

               kelly sits slumped in a chair legs tied up one of the 
               germans shines a flashlight in his face kelly squints

                                     kelly
                         come on you pussies lets get this 
                         over with

               the german officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain 
               pen

                                     german officer
                              german accent

                         how you will die now

               kelly takes the pen and examines it

                                     kelly
                         genuine third reich issue no less 
                         nice work

               the officer pokes the paper

                                     german officer
                         you will write how you die alone

                                     kelly
                         my mother and i dont have that kind 
                         of relationship

                                     german officer
                              hisses
                         write

               kelly thinks about it for a minute  should he or shouldnt 
               he  but sighs and begins writing after a few lines the 
               officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an 
               infantryman

                                     german officer
                         enough now you will beg for your 
                         life

                                     kelly

                                     infantryman
                              interrupts sheepishly 
                              in german accent
                         the protocol says we should 

               the officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker he seems 
               to be getting a bit hysterical

                                     german officer
                         i am the fucking protocol
                              to kelly
                         beg!

               he and kelly glare at each other

               the officer fires his luger into the rafters

                                     german officer
                         beg  for  your  life!

                                     kelly
                         you got to be kidding me

               the officer grabs his throat

                                     german officer
                         silence now i have a little fun

               kelly laughs the officer slaps him kelly jerks away

                                     kelly
                         now thats against the rules

                                     german officer
                              sneers
                         there are no rules in war

               suddenly another american gi appears behind the german in 
               the shadows

               only kelly can see him the gi motions to kelly keep talking 
               while he gets into a better position with his m1 rifle

                                     kelly
                              to officer

               the gi shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated 
               pain and commence death throes

               quick as a flash the gis colt 1911 pistol is at the german 
               officers neck his m1 in his other hand

               space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece

                         low on ammo the cries of wounded 
                         men fill the air like the cries of 
                         hungry babies

               sarah covers her head huddled behind the boxes of cat food 
               dodging cans

               sarah stands up and starts to wander away but kelly makes a 
               peace offering

               sarah looks at her feet considering whether or not to accept 
               it

                                     sarah

               int dairy backroom

               sarah and kelly sit on milk crates pass the cookies back 
               and forth and get philosophical

                                     sarah
                         the frozen food woman came in with

                         little cardboard trays every night 
                         one of the kids looked like cardboard

                                     kelly
                         do you know we stock more flavors of

                         to buy her kid some cat food

               an angry woman pushes open the swinging door of the backroom 
               with her loaded shopping cart

                                     woman

               sarah gets up kelly stays right where he is finishing a 
               cookie

                                     sarah

                         charge her double for everything

               sarah smiles and hurries away

               int shaker heights high  day

               kelly walks down the hall with his armyissue backpack slung 
               over one shoulder besides a serious case of bedhead he 
               looks normal

               no one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker

               as he twirls the combination and opens it he notices lance  
               short and wide built like a tank prematurely balding and 
               his girlfriend bridget embracing a few lockers down

               they kiss raunchily their tongues darting in and out of 
               each others mouths

               lance sees kelly looking and stops kissing

                                     lance
                         what the fuck are you looking at gi 
                         jane

               kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker

                                     lance
                         no really what makes you think you 
                         can look at me

                                     kelly
                         i honestly didnt know it was you i 
                         thought it was a free preview of the 
                         spice channel

                                     lance
                         thats pretty funny you got dental 
                         insurance

               kelly closes his locker and walks away

               bridget wipes her mouth guiltily

               lance shakes his head and pulls bridget to him grinding his 
               pelvis against hers

                                     bridget
                         stop it

               she walks away

                                     lance
                         what what

               int classroom  day

               the lights are off in history class

               the teacher mr norman shows slides on the civil war the 
               more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own 
               photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials

               mr norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot

               he clicks the remote and a photo of his wife crouched over 
               and wearing shorts drinking from a garden hose appears on 
               screen

                                     mr norman
                         whoops!

               he hurries through to the next slide

               it doesnt matter anyway everyone is almost asleep

               except kelly who becomes increasingly irritated the more 
               mr norman talks

                                     mr norman
                         and here at gettysburg the ranks 
                         of union soldiers fought bravely on 
                         they were willing to give their lives 
                         so that others might be free

               kelly shifts in his seat

                                     mr norman
                         is there a problem mr ernswiler

                                     kelly
                         no

               but mr norman doesnt start talking again

               he waits looking at kelly smiling blandly until the silence 
               becomes uncomfortable and kelly gets mad

                                     kelly
                         come on isnt this analysis a tad 
                         simplistic i mean maybe for a second 
                         grade history class sure  but to 
                         insist on still characterizing the 
                         civil war as some moral struggle 
                         the soldiers were drafted  the only 
                         ones who had to fight were the ones 
                         who couldnt afford to pay their way 
                         out
                              losing it
                         why dont you talk about the draft 
                         riots where are your slides for 
                         that

               int principals office  moments later

               fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the 
               place cozy

               kelly sits across the desk from principal holmstead a well
               groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor

                                     holmstead
                         what gives you the idea that you can 
                         or ought to question the curriculum

               kelly doesnt move hes not into this

                                     holmstead
                         or question your teacher

                                     kelly
                         i know i mean who ever heard of a 
                         classroom dialog not socrates

               ms holmstead is exasperated but she likes him in spite of 
               herself hes a smart cookie shes got to change her 
               strategy

               she leans back in her chair

                                     holmstead
                         kelly youre a very bright boy but 
                         youre making some serious mistakes

                         i dont need to everyone else makes 
                         them for me

               her chair squeaks as she leans forward and looks at kelly 
               intently

                                     holmstead
                         this anger must be masking a lot of 
                         hurt

                                     kelly
                         i was wondering what the tissues 
                         were for

               holmstead tries again she looks down at his file

                                     holmstead
                         i see youre not going to college 
                         next year what are your plans

               kelly shrugs holmstead searches his face for any clues

                                     holmstead

                                     kelly
                         advertisers use status and sex to 
                         appeal to my demographic

               she shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window 
               and gazes out at the front walkway of the school her face 
               clears somethings clicked

                                     holmstead
                         i think we can come up with a 
                         punishment which might actually be 
                         more of an opportunity for you to 
                         realize your true potential

               schools been out for a while the first rush had already 
               left

               kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking 
               lot to his jeep

               lance steps out from behind an suv and intercepts him

                                     lance

               hes suddenly nervous he knocks over a few cans of thinner 
               almost leaves

               instead he gathers his courage goes to the display opposite 
               hers and waits to catch her eye

                         theyre having a sale on glitter

               it takes tabby a second to recognize him

                                     tabby
                         oh hello what happened to you

               tabby looks at him suspiciously like shes not sure whether 
               to believe him

               tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints

               kelly follows her staying in the opposite aisle

                                     tabby

                         question

                         i dont really feel comfortable 
                         calling anything done since the 
                         renaissance painting we might 
                         have a more experimental interaction 
                         with the picture plane but our skills 
                         have suffered from it

               in spite of herself tabby laughs at this this gives kelly 
               more confidence he leans over the aisle to see what shes 
               looking at

                                     kelly

               kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves 
               knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them

               when she starts to close the locker door kelly rushes towards 
               her and bumps into her her books and papers spill to the 
               floor

               kelly ducks into a doorway just in time he turns and pretends 
               to look at a posted announcement as she passes

               bart inspects bridgets book report with a jewelers loop

               int cafeteria

               the crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound 
               of the stage curtain opening

               they squint from the bright stage lights

               shock ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau 
               revealed to them

               a frozen halfnaked lance on his knees before a blowup doll 
               tied to a chair

               hysterical laughter

               int lighting booth

               kelly smiles laughs and claps his hands with delight then 
               he returns to military precision he turns all the switches 
               back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the 
               doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints

                         says every employee is part owner 
                         so you could say im a captainof
                         industry in training kind of 
                         capitalist larva

               kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little

                                     kelly

                         i figure i wont be going out much 
                         then pupa the awkward adolescence 
                         of the insect world

               miner stares at kelly he cant tell what he might be making 
               fun of or if it might be him

                                     miner
                         whatever it takes to get you through 
                         the day

               kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response though 
               miner doesnt see it he grabs tabbys paintbrush and pulls 
               her to him

                                     miner

               kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint 
               on his canvas in exaggerated strokes

                                     tabby
                         i really shouldnt

               tabby kisses miner he realizes theres no convincing her 
               and sighs

                                     miner
                         like tonight we can practice 
                         honeymoon suite

                                     tabby
                         maybe probably

               miner looks at kelly who looks away

               then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves

               tabby and kelly paint in silence for a while kelly moves 
               around to look at his canvas from different angles like 
               hes copying what he thinks a painter would do

                                     kelly
                         is he always like that

                                     tabby
                         like what

                                     kelly
                         overbearing

               tabby stops and puts down her brush

                                     tabby
                         just because he didnt want to picture 
                         you as a pupa

                                     kelly
                         oh he will  later when hes alone 
                         whether he wants to or not

               kelly paints

                                     kelly
                         not that though how he wanted you 
                         to stop

                                     tabby
                         he wants to be with me whats so 
                         bad about that

                                     kelly
                         just because some one wants to be 
                         with you doesnt mean theyre good 
                         for you

               kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting he has a 
               hard time making eye contact with tabby

                                     kelly
                         no one should ever ask you to stop 
                         if you stop you might not be able 
                         to start again or you might start 
                         again only things will be different

                                     tabby
                         well thats sweet 

                                     kelly
                         its not sweet actually its just 
                         the truth

                                     tabby
                         hey i can take care of myself

               she picks up her brush

                                     kelly
                         whens the wedding

                                     tabby
                         at the end of the month but dont 
                         ask me about it it makes me nervous

               kelly looks at her seriously

                                     kelly
                         why is something wrong

                                     tabby
                         no

               awkward silence

                                     tabby
                         what are you painting

               kelly stops and sighs now back in serious artist mode

                                     kelly
                         really there are so many layers of 
                          imagistic symbolism  that i really 
                         dont feel comfortable summing it 
                         up but well  its a recurring 
                         dream image a mermaid riding a rocket 
                         ship

               tabby stops painting

               kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artists 
               gesture

                         exciting

               kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette his gestures 
               slow down hes taking this in then he shakes it off

                                     kelly

               kelly walks over and sees what shes working on a beautiful 
               spare chinese landscape

                                     kelly

                                     xiouxiou

                         contained in it each drawing has a 
                         whole life contained in it

                         oh thats all

               kelly watches her for a minute the delicate whoop and swirl 
               of her strokes

               he dips a brush into the ink and watches xiouxious 
               restrained and confident movements

               eve leans against the doorframe

                              to tabby
                         so darling when are you going to 
                         bite the bullet and do the seating 
                         arrangement

               tabby puts down her fork

                                     tabby
                         i cant deal with that stuff ma i 
                         dont care who sits next to whom i 
                         should have eloped

                                     kelly
                         after all mrs bowland sometimes 
                         when you bite the bullet it explodes 
                         in your mouth

               mathilda looks surprised this could go either way

                                     mathilda
                              tentatively
                         why ive never thought about it 
                         before but that is a rather strange 
                         expression isnt it you wouldnt 
                         say sooner or later youve got to 
                         put the grenade in your pants would 
                         you

                                     harrison
                         but have you ever noticed how in 
                         movies they always bite the grenade 
                         before they throw it

                                     kelly
                         yeah but they never take a bite out 
                         of their pants

               everyone but bart laughs

               tabby throws kelly a grateful glance for getting her out of 
               a conversation she didnt want to have

                                     mathilda
                         what an unusual conversation! do you 
                         have similar discussions at the dinner 
                         table with your family kelly

                                     kelly
                         basically i ask why all the furniture 
                         is missing and my dad reminisces 
                         about dropping acid and watching 
                         neil armstrong walk on the moon

               all but bart laughs again

                                     tabby

                         is there nothing you cant discuss

               if anyone notices the slight edge to barts voice they ignore 
               it

               kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his 
               sleeve

               principal holmsteads smiling face greets him when he 
               straightens up

               kelly frowns at the principals back as she clicks away

               kelly is taken aback by this

                         well no 

               charlie leans back and nods thinking about kellys response 
               he no longer seems angry

                                     charlie
