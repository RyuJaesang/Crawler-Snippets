          fade in

          hibernating groundhogs
          a family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow
          sleeping off the end of a long winter

          roll credits and theme music

           dissolve to

          

          ext a forest clearing  early morning

          the crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground
          and the bare icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
          early morning light

          int tv studio  same time

          phil connors is standing in front of a blank green wall
          gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall
          talking a mile a minute mos  he looks completely crazy as he
          points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience

          credits continue as we streak across the winter landscape
          flying over fields and farms small towns and hamlets railroad
          lines and interstates coalyards and factories until we cross
          the allegheny river and follow it to the southwest

          int tv studio  same time

          phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall  but
          from a new angle we can see that he  s looking at a monitor out
          of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert hes
          pointing to  a national weather map

          the country towns turn to suburbs traffic on the roads gets
          heavier and finally we see the skyline of pittsburgh and the
          confluence of the allegheny with the monongahela and the ohio

          we zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and

           dissolve to

          

          int phil connors office  morning

          we dont see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
          volumes about its inhabitant team pictures of the steelers
          from the franco harristerry bradshaw glory years a framed
          memorial portrait of roberto clemente a local emmy award
          statue an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
          on the desk ^windowsill and every other available surface
          as the credits end we notice a sleeping figure on the small
          sofa buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
          blanket
          gil hawley executive producer of the action news sticks his
          head in the door

           hawley

          ruggedlooking perhaps a little too full of himself but
          clearly a guy with a lot of personality

           phil
           catching on
           oh no! not again
          he jumps up and exits the office with hawley right behind him

           phil

          int corridor  continuous

          hawley pursues phil through the office suite of the channel 9
          action news from the look of it a typical big city local
          news operation a logo on the wall identifies the station as

          phils phorecast with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
          to the title

           phil
           no way all that moisture coming

          rita is relatively new to the station but very competent
          personable humorous selfassured and very pretty in short
          a genuine princess though phil is too selfabsorbed at this
          point to realize it

           phil

           teasing

           story like this shes just a

          hawley exits leaving phil and rita alone in the studio she
          knows phil mainly by his reputation and it isnt good still
          she finds him appealing in an odd way

           phil

           pleasantly

           interesting

           and sensitive person

           rita

          stephanie decastro  an attractive darkeyed darkhaired
          correspondent glares at phil from across the studio

          

          int phils office  later

          phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
          two years on a small monitor as he talks he stuffs a number
          of personal items in an overnight bag all the time watching
          himself on the tv monitor

           phil
           on the phone
           they dont really think of me as
           a weatherman around here more
           of a personality but with the
           credibility of a firstclass
           broadcast journalist once you
           look at my tape i think youll
           see what they mean
          stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at phil for
          a long moment there is something vaguely offcenter about
          this woman not quite fatal attraction but still a little
          scary

           stephanie

           bitterly
           i just want to know one thing
           did i do something wrong or are
           you just tired of me or what i
           have to know
          phil sighs

           phil
           on the phone
           dan can i call you back ive
           just been handed something and i
           better get on it
           he picks up some
           papers and rustles
           them for effect
           okay thanks

          

           7

          
          he takes off the headset gets up and closes the door for
          privacy

           phil

           first time we went out

           stephanie
           getting close
           everybody says that at the
           beginning of a relationship

           phil
           gently pushing her

           it! things are really starting
           to move for me now i  m not

           cant waste any more time

           stephanie

           was a waste of time

           phil

           total of four times! and only
           twice did anything happen it
           was fun but i dont see that as
           a big commitment

           stephanie
           closing in again
           i had our charts done my
           astrologer says were extremely
           compatible there may even be

          puts on his jacket

          standing there with a malevolent look on her face

          in the press area several reporters are already talking to
          their cameras dribbling on about how he could appear any

          their cameras and pointing towards the mound

          the groundhog club official knocks on the groundhogs door
          then opens it and retreats
          phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
          prediction recalling the previous day

           phil
           my forecast is were going to see
           the groundhog peek its head out
           of its hole look around a little
           bit then hes going to come out
           scamper over to this general
           area look at the crowd for a
           second make a little burping
           noise and run back into the
           ground

           rita
           whispers to larry
           thats it im going to kill
           him
          phil looks at his watch

           phil
           o k ay  and here we go
          phil points to the hole and larry zooms in
          the groundhog sticks his head out looks left looks right
          steps out of the hole and runs away from the press pool
          directly over to larrys camera as he stands there his body
          casts a long shadow the groundhog looks right into the
          camera lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole
          rita and larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
          brief appearance of the groundhog larry pans back to phil
          phil just stands there speechless staring at the groundhog
          burrow

          mrs lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the
          hall outside phils room listening at the door and looking
          very worried loud music is playing inside the room
          from inside the room they hear the sound of loud hammering
          wood splintering and glass breaking

          

          int phils room  continuous

          phil has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
          in the room he rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
          the crowbar then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
          sink
          phil stands there staring at his image in the mirror trying
          to figure out whats happening to him he starts breathing
          heavier as if gathering courage then just when we think hes
          going to cut off his ear or something he raises an electric
          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
          head he studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
          mirror with his sledgehammer
          then he opens the cans of paint dips the two big brushes into
          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls
          madly feverishly splashing himself and everything else in the
          room with it
          as a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open
          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
          feathers
          finally phil falls exhausted on the bed from outside we can
          hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door
          we pan over to the clock radio the only undamaged object in
          the room feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
          reads 559 am the time changes to 600 the radio clicks on
          and i got you babe starts playing as we pan back to phil
          sleeping on the bed
          he opens his eyes jumps out of bed and looks around no
          paint no feathers no damage everything is as clean and tidy
          as the day he checked in
          he races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself his
          hair is completely restored as if it had never been shaved
          the song ends and the deejays come on phil says every word
          right along with them shocked into a state of complete

           time you can do time but if you
           use it wisely theres never
           enough of it so youd better
