           how bad is it

           thats the problem sir we dont know

          agent coulson leads hill and fury through the radiation section
          of the facility hundreds of technicians and other staff run

                       agent phil coulson
           dr selvig read an energy surge from
           the tesseract four hours ago

                          nick fury
           nasa didnt authorize selvig to test
           phase

                        agent phil coulson
           he wasnt testing it he wasnt even in
           the room spontaneous advancement

                        agent maria hill
           it just turned itself on

                          nick fury
           what are the energy levels now

           down we ordered the evac

           how long to get everyone out

           agent phil coulson
           campus should be clear in the next half
           hour

           do better

          continuously heading down to radiation facility floor

                         agent maria hill
           sir evacuation may be futile

                          nick fury
           we should tell them to go back to
           sleep

                         agent maria hill
           if we cant control the tesseracts
           energy there may not be a minimum safe
           distance

                          nick fury
           i need you to make sure that phase 2
           prototypes are shipped out

                          agent maria hill
           sir is that really a priority right
           now

          fury enters the lab facility where the tesseract is being held
          by a compact muon solenoid coil chamber

                          nick fury
           talk to me doctor
          dr erik selvig emerges from behind the cms machine concerned
          the tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random

                          selvig
           director

                          nick fury
           is there anything we know for certain

                          selvig
           tesseract is misbehaving

                          nick fury
           is that supposed to be funny

                          selvig
           no its not funny at all the
           tesseract is not only active
           shesmisbehaving

                          nick fury
           how soon until you pull the plug

                          selvig
           shes an energy source if we turn off
           the power she turns it back on if she
           reaches peak level

                          nick fury
           weve prepared for this doctor
           harnessing energy from space

                          selvig
           we dont have the harness our
           calculations are far from complete now
           shes throwing off interference
           radiation nothing harmful low levels
           of gamma radiation

                          nick fury
           that can be harmful wheres barton

                          selvig
           the hawk up in his nest as usual
          we see clint barton dressed in black tactical gear is up on
          the railings watching them below fury calls barton on his
          earpiece

                          nick fury
           agent barton report
          barton rappels down from the catwalk walks up to fury they
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner

                          nick fury
           i gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things

                          clint barton
           well i see better from a distance

                          nick fury
           are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off

                          nasa scientist

                          to selvig
           doctor its spiking again

                          clint barton
           no ones come or gone its oven is
           clean no contacts no ims if there
           was any tampering sir it wasnt at
           this end

                          nick fury
           at this end

                          clint barton
           yeah the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space right the doors
           open from both sides
          dr selvig clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares suddenly the tesseract
          thunders and shakes the entire facility big enough where both
          agents hill and coulson can feel and theyre at different ends
          of the facility
          the flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder like a boiling pot of water the tesseracts energy
          builds up into a beam much like the bifrost bridge which hits
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the cms device the
          great maelstrom beam fires the tesseract energy the beam then
          forms a vortex which then opens up a portal
          a black hole is created from the portal the blackness of
          space beautiful and mysterious strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a gust of blue energy clouds fill the room blinding
          everyone
          the tesseracts energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facilitys vacuum chamber ceiling its abnormally
          quiet then heavy breathing is heard from the platform
          shield guards slowly approach weapons in hands a figure is
          kneeling on the platform smoke coming off it its loki
          smiling in his mischievous manner he raises his head the smile
          dies down he looks deep into the eyes of fury barton and
          selvig he stands up holing the scepter

                          nick fury
           sir please put down the spear!
          loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where fury
          and barton are standing and shoots out a blue exploding light
          towards them barton tackles fury and they both barely miss
          lokis fired shot
          all hell breaks machine gun fire is shot at loki but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss loki jumps high from the
          platform and attacks those firing at him
          in the blink of an eye loki takes down several guards with his
          knives and energy blasts from the scepter he stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next honestly the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit
          barton tries to stand up loki quickly walks towards him barton
          raises his gun but loki grabs bartons hand

                          loki
           you have heart
          loki points the head of his spear at bartons head bartons
          eyes suddenly glow black the ability to control bartons mind
          is now in lokis hand barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight
          as loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several shield personnel fury takes the tesseract
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the labthen

                          loki
           please dont i still need that

                          nick fury

                          turning
           this doesnt have to get any messier

                          loki
           of course it does ive come too far
           for anything else i am loki of asgard
           and i am burdened with glorious
           purpose

                          selvig
           loki brother of thor

                          nick fury
           we have no quarrel with your people

                          loki
           an ant has no quarrel with a boot

                          nick fury
           you planning to step on us

                          loki
           i come with glad tidings of a world
           made free

                          nick fury
           free from what

                          loki
           freedom freedom is lifes great lie
           once you accept that in your heart
          like a gunslinger loki turns to face selvig whos
          standingbehind him and places his spear against selvigs heart
          selvigs eyes glow black

                          loki
           you will know peace

                          nick fury
           yeah you say peace i kind of think
           you mean the other thing
          from the vacuum chamber ceiling tesseracts energy cloud
          rapidly builds into what may be an implosion

                          clint barton
           sir director fury is stalling this
           place is about to blow drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us he means to bury
           us

                          nick fury
           like the pharaohs of odin

                          selvig
           hes right the portal is collapsing in
           on itself you got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical

                          loki
           well then
          loki looking at barton who doesnt even hesitate shoots fury
          who falls to the ground barton grabs the case containing the
          tesseract and leaves the lab with loki selvig and the other
          shield personnel loki is controlling

          int pegasus bunker entrance of exiting tunnel ­ night

          loki barton selvig and the other shield personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility quickly gathering certain
          weapons agent hill watches in confusion referring to loki

                          clint barton
           pointing to the loki team
           need these vehicles

           agent maria hill
           whos that

                          clint barton
           he didnt tell me
          agent hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave as shes walking away

                          nick fury
           through the walkie talkie
           hill do you copy!
          loki and barton sharply look at agent hill

          back at the lab
          fury is sitting up pulling out the bullet breathing heavily

           barton is

          int pegasus bunker ­ night

          suddenly hill turns to shoot at barton but barton is already
          pointing his gun at her and starts shooting he moves the
          drivers seat of the truck and drives off as hill keeps
          shooting

          back at the lab
          fury is holding his side running

                          nick fury
           hes got the tesseract! track it down!
          the energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling

          int pegasus bunker/tunnel ­ night

          agent hill slips into a jeep and follows after bartons
          trucklokis trucks screech across the tunnel several shield
          trucks pull up to them a driveby shooting ensues
          loki who stands on top of the bed of the truck uses his
          scepter and emits energy blasts flipping over shield trucks
          they get in the cars roar out after them agent hill puts
          herself at a distance

          agent coulson and several shield agents fall down the steps
          dropping silver cases of information they attempt to grab them
          but

           agent phil coulson
           no! leave it!
          they run out of there like a bat from hell

          int pegasus tunnel ­ night

          agent hills jeep roars out of a side of bartons truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left she goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake swerving into a 360 facing bartons truck and
          driving in reverse
          bartons arms reach out the open window and opens fire agent
          hill figures fuck it and shoots her windshield opening fire on

           youre clear sir! you need to go!

          ext helicopter pad ­ continuous

          fury bolts out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter the
          surface of the pad gives way plunging the helicopter through
          the surface but furys chopper barely makes it out

          int pegasus tunnel ­ night

          still in a chase and driveby sequence bartons pushes the
          pedal harder which causes agent hills jeep to wobble out and

          the desert fury watches from below a rapid buildup into what
          may be an implosion several miles away agent coulsons van

          along with one of ours

                          steve
          i wanna know why loki let us take him
          hes not leading an army from here

                          banner
          i dont think we should be focusing on
          loki that guys brain is a bag full of
          cats you could smell crazy on him

                          thor
          have care how you speak loki is beyond
          reason but he is of asgard and hes
          my brother

                          natasha
          he killed eighty people in two days

                          thor
          hes adopted

                          banner
          iridium what did they need the iridium
          for

                          tony
          its a stabilizing agent
           walks in with coulson to

                          coulson
          ill fly you there keep the love
          alive means the portal wont collapse
          on itself like it did at shield

                          tony contd

                          to thor
           no hard feelings point break youve
           got a mean swing
           referring to the iridium
           also it means the portal can open as
           wide and stay open as long as loki
           wants

                          to crew
           uh raise the midmast ship the top
           sails that man is playing galaga!
           thought we wouldnt notice but we did
           covering his eye looks

                          around
           how does fury do this

           agent maria hill
           he turns
          tony looks around the monitors and places a button size hacking
          implant under furys desk without anyone noticing

                          tony
           well that sounds exhausting the rest
           of the raw materials agent barton can
           get his hands on pretty easily only
           major component he still needs is a
           power source a high energy density
           something to kick start the cube

           agent maria hill
           when did you become an expert in
           thermonuclear astrophysics

                          tony
           last night the packet selvigs notes
           the extraction theory papers am i the
           only one who did the reading

                          steve
           does loki need any particular kind of
           power source

                          banner
           hes got to heat the cube to a
           hundredand twenty million kelvin just
           to break through the coulomb barrier

                          tony
           unless selvig has figured out how to
           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect

                          banner
           well if he could do that he could
           achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor
           on the planet

                          tony
           finally someone who speaks english

                          steve
           is that what just happened
          tony and banner shake hands a glimmer in their eyes shines as
          the mutual respect for each other shows

                          tony
           its good to meet you dr banner
           youre work on antielectron collisions
           is unparalleled and im a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster

                          banner

                          looks down
           thanks

                          nick fury

                          walking in
           dr banner is only here to track the
           cube i was hoping you might join him

                          steve
           lets start with that stick of his it
           may be magical but it works an awful
           lot like a hydra weapon

                          nick fury
           i dont know about that but it is
           powered by the cube and id like to
           know how loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men i know into his
           personal flying monkeys

                          thor
           monkeys i do not understand

                          steve
           i do! i understood that reference
          tony rolls his eyes while cap looks proud of himself

                          tony
           shall we play doctor

                          banner
           lets play some
          as banner and tony walk out the galaga player turns ever so
          discreetly watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing

          int banners lab  night later

          banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation
          tony looks at his monitors shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations

                          banner
           the gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with selvigs reports on the
           tesseract but its gonna take weeks to
           process

                          tony
           if we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the homer cluster we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops

                          banner
           all i packed was a tooth brush

                          tony

                          smiles
           you know you should come by stark
           towers sometime top ten floors all

           well i promise a stress free
           environment no tension no surprises
          suddenly tony pokes banner with a miniature electrical prod
          steve walks in on them pissed at tony

                          banner

           ow!
          tony looks at banner closely

                          tony
           nothing

                          steve

                          tony
           funny things are

                          steve
           threatening the safety of everyone on
           this ship isnt funny no offense
           doctor

                          banner

           youre tiptoeing big man you need to
           strut

                          steve

           mr stark

                          tony
           you think im not why did fury call us
           and why now why not before what isnt
           he telling us i cant do the equation
           unless i have all the variables

                          steve
           you think furys hiding something

                          tony
           hes a spy captain hes the spy his
           secrets have secrets

           its bugging him too isnt it

                          banner
           bobbling the words

           a warm light for all mankind lokis
           jab at fury about the cube

                          steve
           i heard it

                          banner
           pointing at tony
           well i think that was meant for you
           even if barton didnt post that all
           over the news

                          steve
           the stark tower that big ugly
           tony gives him a look
           building in new york

                          banner
          its powered by stark reactors self
          sustaining energy source that building
          will run itself for what a year

                          tony
          thats just the prototype im kind of
          the only name in clean energy right
          now

                          banner
           referring to tony
          so why didnt shield bring him in on
          the tesseract project i mean what are
          they doing in the energy business in
          the first place

                          tony
          i should probably look into that once
          my decryption programmer finishes
          breaking into all of shields secure
          files

                          steve
           taken by that
          im sorry did you say

                          tony
          jarvis has been running it since i hit
          the bridge in a few hours well know
          every dirty secret shield has ever
          tried to hide
           holds out a bag of blueberries
          blueberry

                          steve
          yet youre confused about why they
          didnt want you around

                          tony
          an intelligence organization that fears
          intelligence historically not
          possible

                          steve
           i think lokis trying to wind us up
           this is a man who means to start a war
           and if dont stay focused hell
           succeed we have orders we should
           follow them

                          tony
           following is not really my style

                          steve

                          smiling
           and youre all about style arent you

                          tony
           a nerve hit
           of the people in this room which one
           is a wearing a spangly outfit and b
           not of use

           steve tell me none of this smells a
           little funky to you
          steve takes in the possibility but as an obedient soldier
          shakes it off

                          steve
           just find the cube
          steve walks out of the lab still torn apart by the possibility
          he walks away towards the hull of the ship

          back in the lab

                          tony
           thats the guy my dad never shut up

           nightmare

                          tony
           you know ive got a cluster of
           shrapnel trying every second to crawl
           its way into my heart
           points at the miniarc
           reactor in his chest
           this stops it this little circle of

           armor its a terrible privilege

           but you can control it

                          tony
           because i learned how

                          banner
           its different
          banner tries to read the computer screen but tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see facetoface

                          tony
           hey ive read all about your accident
           that much gamma exposure should have
           killed you

                          banner
           so youre saying that the hulk the
           other guy saved my life

                          banner contd
           thats nice its a nice sentiment

                          a beat

           tesseract to build weapons of mass
           destruction

                          nick fury
           because of him

          that leveled a small town we learned
          that not only are we not alone but we
          are hopelessly hilariously outgunned

                          thor

          youre work with the tesseract is what
          drew loki to it and his allies it is
          the signal to all the realms that the
          earth is ready for a higher form of
          war

                          steve

          calms everything right down

          fury fires at barton but is already gone the arrow then self
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets hacking every

          down breathing fast loki makes his way to the control switch
          he gives his brother one last look thor looks at him hopeful
          loki opens the hatch thor still hopes loki hits the button and

          drops thor out of the ship

          barton and natasha continue attacking each other natasha
          kickboxes bartons face feeling that barton takes a swing at
          her but she grabs his arm twisting it barton writhes in pain
          using his other arm he tosses the knife over and begins to
          slash at natasha she dodges every move but finds herself in a
          lock hold with him as he forces the knife down she bites his
          wrist barton lets go of the knife
          natasha wraps her legs around his neck flips him over and arm
          locks him she slams his head into a pipes rail barton goes
          down hard he looks up her almost coming to his real senses

          but misses land draws closer
          in a final attempt before crashing thor positions himself onto
          the glass door and leapfrogs just as the cage is about to hit
          the ground the cell crashes into the shore as thor crashes out
          into the meadow
