                         pundit #1
          congressman norris has a reputation
          for being very direct even blunt
          in his campaign speeches which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadnt then you
          start to look like an amateur

                         pundit #2
          thats bad for any candidate but
          its fatal if youre running for
          senate at the age of 33 your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          impulsive kid and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the

          clearer in my ads

                         woman

          friends at a college reunion is no
          big deal

                         beat
          and i dont think the post should
          have printed the photo
          david just shakes his head he will never ever live that
          down and he knows it

                         woman

                         david

                         david
          the only time a politician is alone
          is when hes asleep or in the
          bathroom after eight years in
          politics that gets kind of hard to
          take
          she tilts her head a little gives him a curious look

                         woman
          watching you youd never know it
          the way she looks at him the way she says it david knows
          she sees what others miss in him  even if he isnt even
          quite sure what it is not yet

                         david

                         david

          caught dropping my drawers in the
          middle of a senate campaign i would
          have lost the election anyway
          because im too blunt

          you got in a fight its not
          whether or not you get knocked down
           because eventually everyone does
           its what you do when you get
          back up

          thousands of interconnected lines dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points and written notations in a
          language as complex as sanskrit crossed with chinese
          and maybe its just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to rearrange themselves on the page

          security guards who chased elise away on election night

          david contd
          what the hell are you doing!
          richardson blinks clearly surprised then

                         richardson
          grab him!
          david bolts out of the office as they lunge at him

          int rsr office floor  morning

          david sprints toward the door he came in it closes as he
          gets there he grabs it its locked
          he sprints away into an internal hallway richardson emerges
          from a door in the middle of the hallway

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 27
          david jumps a mile its physically impossible that
          richardson could have gotten there that fast

                         richardson
          you cant get away david
          david spins and rushes back into the main office then down
          an internal staircase to the floor below jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard
          as he comes up he runs smack into another rsr employee who is
          frozen solid
          david curses then dives around the frozen employee to find
          richardson coming out of another office down the hall
          again physically impossible for him to get there that fast
          david spins and a distorted wide angle shot of a
          chloroform rag shoved right at us focus goes in and out
          from davids pov blurry focus as hes carried toward one of
          the large corner offices on the 40th floor
          the nameplate reads steve kincaid
          richardson opens the door and ushers his men carrying david

                         inside 
           except when they walk through the door theyre not in an
          office 40 floors above lower manhattan they step inside a
          large warehouse
          their movement completely violates the laws of physics

                         black screen
          silence then voices come up slowly

          richardson os
          yes sir no sir no sir i
          understand that sir absolutely
          ill do that sir

          what a goddamm mess

          mccrady os

          richardson os

          2/12/09 28
           fade up  blurry at first  to davids pov of the warehouse
          david caught a glimpse of just before he passed out
          a halfdozen members of the intervention team the silver
          suits stand nearby richardson and mccrady one of the men
          from the rooftops stand behind david about 20 feet away

          richardson os
          can you reset him

          mccrady os
          i dont think we have the authority
          in a situation like this

          richardson os

                         call legal

          burdensky 0s
          legal just arrived

          int warehouse  day

          reveal burdensky a 50 yearold in a pinstripe suit
          carrying a briefcase hewalks to richardson

                         burdensky
          resettings off the table this
          is our fault
          richardson glances irately at harry who stands by himself
          off to the side clearly disgraced
          david who is tied to a chair facing away from richardson
          cranes around to see whos talking

                         david
          hey
          the suits stare back in silence for a beat then turn back to
          talking amongst themselves  though at a lower volume

                         richardson
          what are my options

                         burdensky

                         ignoring david
          you could bullshit him but youll
          never be completely successful

                         david
          can somebody tell me whats going
          on

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 29

                         burdensky
          still ignoring him
          the questions will burn in him till
          the day he dies youll have to
          monitor him constantly

                         on david
          he can hear little snippets of what burdenskys saying

          burdensky partially audible
          to make sure he doesnt talk
          the endless ripple effects
          reveal david untying the rope restraining him

          on the suits

                         burdensky
          if it were me id level with him

                         richardson
          completely

                         burdensky
          thats the only way to extinguish
          his curiosity
          richardson turns and studies david then walks over to him
          an uncomfortable pause

                         david
          who are you guys

                         richardson
          were the people v ho make sure
          things happen according to plan
          david stares back at him for a moment
          then leaps up his rope comes off and the chair falls he
          sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse
          richardson makes a little gesture with his hand

          closeup of the floor
          it cracks and displaces upward so its uneven just as
          davids foot comes down on it

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 30

          back to wide shot
          david trips and goes flying

                         moments later
          david is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
          back in his chair in front of richardson

                         richardson
          did you really think i couldnt see
          that coming
          david dabs blood from his lip which split during the fall

                         richardson contd
          i can read your mind!
          david stares back

                         richardson contd
          yeah really

                         beat
          choose a color
          barely a beat
          blue choose a number
          even less time
          seventeen
          davids jaw drops slightly richardson was clearly right

                         richardson
          now why are you still deciding
          whether or not to run
          davids hands go to his head involuntarily an atavistic
          response as ifsomehow that will keep his thoughts from
          spilling out into view

                         richardson
          you saw the futility of that back
          at the office
          davids entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
          point he cant hang on any longer to an explanation for all
          this based in the world hes known to date

                         david
          what the hell is happening to me

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 31

                         richardson
          you just saw behind a curtain you
          werent even supposed to know was
          there mr norris its jarring
          im sure

                         david
          i just came to work

                         richardson
          it wasnt your fault your path
          through the world this morning was
          supposed to be adjusted
          glancing bitterly at
          harry in the corner
          your coffee was supposed tospill
          onto your shirt as you left
          starbucks near your apartment
          you would have gone up to change
          and arrived at work ten minutes
          later than you did by then we
          would have left

                         beat
          people call it chance when their
          coffee spills or their internet
          goes down or they misplace their
          keys sometimes it is sometimes
          itsusnudging you back on plan
          david takes all this in hes still shellshocked

                         david
          whatever you were doing to charlie
          back there it wasnt misplacing
          his keys

                         richardson
          sometimes when nudging a person
          back on plan isnt enough we
          intervene directly

                         david
          why charlie what did you do to
          him

                         richardson
          you need to worry about getting
          back on your plan david not worry
          about us putting him back on his
          david stares back still trying to get his bearings

                         richardson contd
          only a handful of human beings know
          what you now know david were
          determined to keep it that way

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 32

                         richardson contd
          so before i let you go you need to
          understand something if you ever
          reveal our existence we will erase
          your brain your memories your
          emotions your entire personality
          will be expunged your friends and

                         richardson
          not a word not one word about us
          long beat as he studies

                         davids face
          okay   youre free to go
          david stands there a monentnot sure its real richardson
          points at the door david walks toward it

          theres awoman

                         richardson

          richardson motionsto his men
          atthe door

          he holds open a planbook for richardson to see

          changing his shirt in his
          apartment it was a controlled
          situation it was supposed to be
          the new man looks at harry

          at the door
          david looks back at richardson

                         david

          why do you care

                         richardson
          because david you cant be with
          her and we didnt want to have to
          resort to this
          four big guys grab david and pull his arms backwards like
          prison guards incapacitating a prisoner richardson reaches
          into davids pocket and pulls out his wallet

                         david
          what the hell what are you
          richardson removes the piece of paper that elise wrote her
          number on from davids wallet

                         david contd

                         no

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 34
          richardson places the wallet back in davids pocket then
          pulls out a lighter

                         david contd
          no!
          and burns elises number david strains and tries to pull
          loose from the vicelike grip of the four intervention team
          men but he cant get free

                         david contd
          what is wrong with you people!
          richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn
          on davids reaction cut to

          ext warehouse  day

          david exits through a steel door it clangs shut behind him
          he stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
          walking to the corner to orient himself
          down one street he spots the manhattan bridge down the other
          the brooklyn bridge hes in dumbo

          int brooklyn cocktail lounge  afternoon

          david sits alone at the bar his hand trembles slightly

           warm his right hand feels something he pulls out a
          ticket for the 4 pm circleline tourist boat cruise
          ext circle line crutge  day

          looking back at manhattan harry is next to him

                         harry
          a lot of people just collapse when
          they see what youve seen their
          personal choices suddenly seem
          meaningless to them life starts
          to feel pointless

                         david
          i was raised to believe theres
          something behind the curtain i
          just never pictured it quite like
          this

                         harry
          most people dont
          harry looks over his shoulder scans for any signs of his
          colleagues hes far from relaxed

                         harry
          how are you feeling

                         david
          you should know you can read my
          mind right

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 38
          harry hesitatesas if hes not sure how much to tell david
          how far to go with this finally

                         harry
          richardson was just trying to scare
          you

                         david
          he knew what color i was thinking

                         harry
          because he set it up as a choice
          choose a color choose a number

                         david
          so
          harry looks away hes crossing a line hes really putting
          himself out there

                         harry
          we cant read your mind or hear
          your thoughts but before you make
          a choice your brain weighs options
          and we percpite that we know if
          youre going to go off plan or not
          because as long as were close
          enough we cansense it when its
          about to happen

                         david
          it s like a sixth sense for you

                         harry
          seventh actually

                         david
          what did they do too charlie

                         harry
          made some small change in the way
          he assesses risk

                         david
          what type of risk

                         harry
          this is beside the point
          i dont know something arcane
          something to do with mortgage
          backed securities

                         david
          thats all

                         harry
          yes

                         david
          what would your colleagues do to
          you if they knew what you were
          telling me
          this is precisely what harry has been worried about

                         harry
          thats why were meeting out here

                         david
          theyre not following me

                         harry
          we dont have the manpower to
          follow everybody all the time
          theyre checking in on you just
          not here not right now
          on davids face considering this

          ext upper deck day

          moments later they stand out of earshot of the few
          tourists up here

                         david
          why are you helping me

                         harry
          i have my reasons
          david studies him ha=rrys clearly not ready to go into

                         them

                         david

                         david

          harry looks back at him taken aback a bit by how much david
          seems to care

                         harry
          i dont know

          int bus  minutes later  morning

          david stares idly out the window his blackberry buzzes with
          a text message looks down at it then looks back out the

          why

          you just do absurd things with your
          body the movement is completely
          unnatural it requires incredible
          strength in all sorts of random
          muscles and you have to be born
          with ridiculous amounts of
          flexibility in your hip or youll

          a kiss thats all it takes

                         mccrady
          a real kiss but once they do that
          every possible adjustment thats
          strong enough to break them up will
          cause ripples over your limit

          im goingto interpret those rules
          loosely im going to go easy on
          you becausei feel the deck was
          stacked against you

          aide sit nearby

                         donaldson
          im talking about the intense

          apart only to have chance put
          them back together twice that
          seemed impossible so i asked
          burdensky to do some research this
          morning which he just completed

          uniquely human things as well

          run aw ay from the embarrassing
          things theyve done yoticrack
          jokes about them you embrace
          them especially since your
          concession speech thr
          ee years ago
          which started as a sstdup routine
          and brought tears to myeyes by the
          end when you talked about losing
          your mother to lancer and then your
          older brotherpdt to an overdose

                         david
          i think americans are tired of
          electing automatons whose every
          word and move is stagemanaged so
          as not to offend anyone i think
          they want somebody who doesnt hide
          who he is or what he really
          believes i guess im hoping they
          want to elect someone whos
          actually like them

                         laughs
          but i could be very wrong about
          that

          david stares back at him

                         thompson
          you know we actually tried free
          will before after taking you from
          hunting and gathering to the height
          of the roman empire we stepped back
          to see how youd do on your own
          you gave us the dark ages  for
          five centuries  until finally we
          decided we should come back in

                         beat
          the chairman thought maybe we just
          needed to do a better job of
          teaching you how to ride the bike
          before we took the training wheels
          off again so we gave you the
          renaissance the enlightenment the
          scientific revolutonï¿½we spent
          six hundred years tempering your
          passions with reasonthen in 1910
          we stepped ba ï¿½c again within
          fifty yearsï¿½you brought us world
          war i the lepression fascism the
          holocaust ani capped it off by
          bringingtheentire planet to the
          brink of destruction in the cuban
          missile crisis a decisiofl was
          taken atthat point that we should
          stop in again before â±ou did
          _soittething even we cduldnt fix

                         beat

          you have free will over what tie
          you pick in the morning or what
          beverage to order at lunch but
          humanity just isnt mature enough
          to have control over the important
          things

                         david
          if youre in control of the
          important things then youre
          incompetent cause when i look

          brother but the plan didnt call
          for that

          plan

          see thompson hurt herbut i used
          it as an excuse i think i left

          the first day after they caught
          me they carried me through onei
          thought it was a hallucination at
          first eventually i realized its
          how you move around so fast
          off harrys reluctance
          if you dont want to help me
          because of what theyll do to
          youokay thats your choice
          but if this is about protecting me
          then shouldnt the choice be mine

                         harry
          do you have any idea how
          complicated it is to navigate
          through those doors how many
          thousands of permutations there are
          in even a simple several block
          journey

                         david
          you know when i do town hall
          meetings i usually get introduced
          to forty or fifty people between
          when i walk through the door and
          when i start speaking but when
          im done with the speech i can call
          on each one of them by game

          david pushes the roof door shut barricades it with some
          concrete blocks sitting on the roof rain pours down on
          them
          they rush to the edge of the roof three con edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below and a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen11 
          david grabs elise and they go to the side of the roof the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them they
          hang their legs over the edge and jump
          they sprint across the roof of the building next door 
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on
          david sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago the door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside
          david and elise run back in the c5pposite direction at the
          buildings edge they climb over again and run
          only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on its like theyre in anescher painting
          they stop and look at each other david takes her hand as
          adjustment team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs theyre completely surrounded

                         elise
          kiss me
          tears well in her eyes and his

                         elise

          2/12/09 128
          they hold each other for a long beat   and then finally
          open their eyes ready to accept their fate
          they see an empty roof the silver suits are gone and the
          rain has stopped a strange silence envelopes them
          they spin the other direction to see the chairman standing
          there alone

                         the chairman
          hello david good morning
          elise
          his voice is gentle paternal

                         david
          who are you

                         the chairman
          i think you know
          david and elise stand in aweas they realize

                         david
          you cant oti{rn fate
          tft  chairman
          its more complicated t}an that
          fate am free will coexist
          theyrein tension with each other
          and pure chance
          a beat david looks back at him

                         david

          th2>ï¿½hat rman
          i could control everything youd
          be ha 3 ou d be puppets i
          try to keep things from getting too
          out of control but that has a
          cost most people go through life
          like pinballs reacting predictably
          to the stimuli i apply they
          accept the path they find
          themselves on and perform
          accordingly but every once in a
          while someone comes along who
          refuses to be bound by his fate
          someone who understands that free
          will is a gift most people are too
          afraid to use

                         beat
          which you see is partly the point
          of all this

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 129
          the chairman contd
          or maybe you dont see it maybe
          you just feel it and thats even
          better because thats the other
          part
          david and elise take it in

                         david
          and all the misery all the pain

                         the chairman
          i sit up there and i watch it and
          it hurts me  but if you could see
          the incredible courage people show
          the random acts of kindness the
          love if you could see huitan
          beings choosing every moment
          every day to be better than i made
          them you would know its all
          worthwhile

                         beat
          good luck david and good luck to
          you elise youre abeautiful
          dancer and so much more
          the chairman turns to his aide who we didnt know was there

                         the chairman
          their case isclosed

          aide to the chairrman
          but sirisnt this a majtr
          deviation from the plan
          the chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
          open and signs a document on ery heavy paper

                         the chairman
          not anymc3e 
          david and elise watc]i the chairman walk away still awed by
          what=theyve just experienced as he disappears around a
          corner the sun comes out from behind the clouds 
          after a long beat elise turns back to david as if to say
          what do we do now

                         david
          maybe we should go dancing
          a smile slowly spreads across her face 

                         the end
