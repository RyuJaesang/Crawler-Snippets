               fade in

               castle  night

               now comes the moon riding over the horizon upon a hill at 
               the edge of the wood squats a castle its crude stonework 
               bathed in cold silvery light queer carvings and runes 
               decorate the ponderous gate heavy vines are climbing up the 
               walls the castle is old its unfamiliar form testament to 
               an ancient mind and an ancient craft flickering candle light 
               dances on a leaded windowpane

               inside the corridors are dark and silent under low arched 
               ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks 
               perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with 
               strange animal heads

               hodge

               a sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables 
               and crockery is hodge a wrinkled old retainer a flickering 
               candle and empty jug are beside the bed he is snoring gently

               conjuring room

               this circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed 
               with parchments scrolls dusty books bronze braziers glass 
               retorts chemical salts birds both stuffed and caged an 
               iron candelabra stands on a work table tapers burning in 
               the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied but no 
               moving in the background is a shadowy figure preparing for 
               a magical deed feet are positioned carefully within a 
               pentagram chiseled into the floor a scroll is consulted up 
               comes an arm and a voice blurts out

                                     voice
                         omnia in duos duo in unum unus in 
                         nihil haec nec quattuor nec omnia 
                         nec duo nec unus nec nihil sunt

               nothing happens

                                     voice
                         come on candles out!

               but the little flames stand at attention without so much as 
               a tremble

                                     voice
                         in volunta divina et verbum magi 
                         lux! exstinguat!

               its no use there is a sigh and the figure moves forward 
               into the light revealed in the glow is the discouraged face 
               of galen bradwardyn sorcerers apprentice

               tower

               carrying the candelabra the youth trudges up a circular 
               staircase

               turret

               the highest point of the castle is a turret open to the 
               stars and the night air here more magic is afoot an old 
               enchanter ulrich magister ipsissimus pours water from a 
               silver ewer into a stone bowl as the surface ripples 
               disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool all at 
               once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and 
               thunder reach his ears lights and shadows reflected from 
               within the basin play across his face his frown deepens as 
               the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in 
               the water  draco draconis  suddenly squelched by the 
               roar of flame and an ugly snarl

               at that moment galen reaches the top of the steps and holds 
               up the candelabra

                                     galen
                         vide magister theres something 
                         wrong

               ulrich startled from his trance slaps the water out of the 
               basin and turns to confront his student galen is taken aback 
               by the old mans grim countenance

                                     galen
                         whats the matter whats happened

                                     ulrich

                         of consequence to you

                                     ulrich
                              calm
                         yes my own death

               with a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish 
               themselves

                                     ulrich
                         perhaps we had better hasten your 
                         training

                                                                    cut to

               barnyard  day

               outside the castle wall hodge is feeding the chickens and 
               ducks he straightens up and squints through the early morning 
               mists on a distant hillock two figures are moving toward 
               the woods

               ulrich and galen

               hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes ulrich guides 
               his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the 
               forest

                                     ulrich
                              stern and troubled

                         the very dome of heaven once they 
                         all rang with one great chord and 
                         philosophers like me kept it all in 
                         tune now new voices are singing 
                         new songs
                              sharply

                         transmutation

                         late master balisarius

                                     galen

                         know it and youre no magician 
                         without it it was my hope to school

                         wits i still believe you have 
                         some talent somewhere

                                     galen

                         half the powers in the universe will 
                         vanish with me and whats the use 
                         of a few lingering skills if theyre 
                         left in the hands of a child
                              pause

                         i dont hear anything

               ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a 
               decision reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver 
               chain with an amulet dangling from it he drapes it around 
               galens neck

                                     ulrich
                         here wear this

               galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel he cocks 
               an ear

                                     galen
                         voices singing on the road

               he hastens forward to a promontory eager to have a look 
               ulrich does not follow instead doffing his cloak he whirls 
               it before him where it magically floats a few feet off the 
               ground awkwardly the old man clambers aboard

                                     galen
                         i dont see anything

               he turns back but the wizard is gone a shadow falls over 
               him he looks up there two hundred feet above the tree 
               tops his master is soaring on the wind

               airborne

               the old conjurer squints into the distance miles away and 
               far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins 
               of the forest they are singing a mournful round

               galen

               he gawks skyward suddenly the old man leans down and 
               addresses him

                                     ulrich
                              a shout

               the sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase

               the rotunda

               the visitors watch warily as a door swings open and galen 
               makes his entrance his face expressionless and hands pressed 
               together he looks rather young to be the famous ulrich

               galen allows a moment to go by then throws his arms wide 
               kawhump! and ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky 
               fireball alarmed the visitors retreat

               in the fireplace the birch logs are suddenly ablaze ulrich

               the warmth

                                     ulrich

                         gods!

               he runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at 
               his visitors

                                     ulrich

               the travelers are making ready for departure in the grey 
               light of dawn as hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box 
               ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches

               the walkers are ready to set forth hodge picks up his pack 
               steps forward and pulls open the great gate

               horsemen

               three mounted men are outside the gate helmets on their 
               heads swords on the belts and longbows across their 
               shoulders they look formidable the urlanders take a step

               of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle

               sensing trouble galen moves forward ulrich touches his 
               arm

                                     ulrich
                              under his breath

               galen hears the urgency in the old mans voice and obeys 
               hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers

                         and youre not going to get one

               when ulrich finally speaks his voice is low and 
               authoritative

                                     ulrich
                              to galen

                         box fetch me the dagger within

               galens eyes widen with alarm

                                     ulrich
                         the dagger be quick

               galen dashes into the castle ulrich gazes almost shyly at 
               tyrian

                                     ulrich
                         you shall have your test

               conjuring room

               galen comes puffing up the steps locates the iron box and 
               flings it open amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a 
               professional magician is an ivoryhandled dagger covered 
               with runic inscriptions galen eagerly examines it to see 
               how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle 
               but it is all too genuine a murder weapon

                                     ulrichs voice
                              impatient
                         where are you boy im waiting

               galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard 
               he displays the dagger

                                     galen
                         not this one was it

                                     ulrich
                         the very one let it fall

               galen hesitates then tosses it tumbling end over end it 
               arcs downward the old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand 
               and plucks it neatly out of the air galen watches as ulrich 
               passes the weapon to tyrian and strips back his robe exposing 
               a bony chest galen knows whats coming he rushes for the 
               door hes only a step away when it bangs shut of its own 
               accord he sprints for a second exit whack! this door slams 
               shut too locked in quick back to the window and climb 
               down the vine smack! the heavy shutters seal him in

               ulrich and tyrian

               ulrich takes tyrians arm and guides the point of the dagger 
               to his breastbone

                                     ulrich
                         vita regula vita hieratica!

               everyone is filled with dread hodge is shaking from the 
               castle come the rattling of shutters and galens muffled 
               cries a sick sarcastic smile has crept over tyrians lips 
               he tenses himself to thrust

                                     ulrich
                         go on dont worry you cant hurt 
                         me

               conjuring room

               galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the 
               shutter below he can see the participants in this grisly 
               drama he holds his breath tyrian makes a sudden movement 
               and buries the blade in ulrichs chest but the sorcerer 
               stands unbent seemingly unhurt then after a long moment 
               he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that 
               holds it tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in 
               a heap very quickly he remounts in another moment he and 
               his companions are gone the others are riveted in horror 
               hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief

               galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the 
               gloomy conjuring room click! the doors unlatch themselves 
               and swing open

                                                                    cut to

               funeral pyre  day

               ulrich principal magician and sorcerer of the western world 
               reposes on a hardwood pyre his hands are folded on his chest 
               his face is peaceful while the visitors wordlessly look on 
               galen touches a burning brand to the kindling at first the 
               fire catches normally enough but when the flames start to 
               envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green producing an 
               unearthly roar the onlookers back away from the intense 
               heat

               galen

               the erstwhile apprentice stands his ground blinking back 
               tears his face weirdly illuminated by the fire

                                                                    cut to

               conjuring room  day

               galen sits alone amidst the museumlike collection of magical 
               apparatus he stares at the amulet considering its 
               significance his reverie is interrupted by the murmur of 
               voices below at the window he looks down to see hodge bidding 
               farewell to the delegation from urland valerian is the last 
               to leave he pauses at the gate and glances up at galen 
               then he moves on the young student of magic sets his jaw 
               suddenly filled with resolve

               moving through the room he busies himself with the old mans 
               effects he scoops up the loose books and parchments and 
               locks them into trunks he drapes muslin cloths over the 
               alchemical devices he sows a handful of salt over the 
               pentagram inscribed in the floor finally he opens the cages 
               and releases the crow the falcon and the great horned owl

               courtyard

               hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre anxiously scraping 
               ashes and small bones into a leather pouch  the remains of 
               ulrich up behind him comes galen now clad in a travelers 
               cloak with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand

                                     galen
                         hodge  what are you doing

               hodge quickly conceals the pouch

                                     hodge
                         just making my farewell thank you 
                         very much

               he quickly climbs down picks up his pack and follows galen 
               out through the gate as the door is pushed shut a huge oaken 
               timber falls into place barring the castle against the 
               uninvited

                                                                    cut to

               hilltop  day

               galen and hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn 
               to look back across a wide valley there on another hilltop 
               on the far side sits cragganmore lit by the red rays of the 
               setting sun galen removes the amulet from his neck and 
               clutches it in his fist hodge is bugeyed to see it

                                     hodge

                         what youre doing

                                     galen
                         stand back!

               he raises his hands toward the castle and calls out

                                     galen
                         cragganmore! domus non i am! silva 
                         celet!

               cragganmore

               the vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch 
               magically brought to animate life they flow upward over the 
               masonry branching out and covering every surface then up 
               onto the roof finally only the tops of the chimneys and the 
               highest turrets stand above the green carpet a centurys 
               growth in a matter of seconds

               galen & hodge

               on their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful 
               look galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has 
               done to notice

                                                                  dissolve

                         fussy about his bath and youd think

               he plucks a lowhanging leaf waves a hand over it and 
               watches it turn into a spray of daffodils

               he gives the pack a slap it flies out of its harness and 
               floats alongside them hodge snatches it back and clutches 
               it tightly

                                     hodge

               a great coat drapes itself over hodges shoulders

                                     hodge

                         too warm

               the greatcoat disappears as do the rest of his garments 
               leaving him in his smalls

                                     hodge

                         the master!

               suppressing a grin galen mercifully waves his hand and 
               restores hodge to his usual costume

               of the men get to their feet and listen at first silence 
               then more rustling without a word the two men dart into the

               there is a moment of depressed silence hodge rolls his eyes 
               greil starts to chuckle then to laugh soon the others are 
               laughing too

               he propels galen out of harms way and sits him down on the 
               other side of the fire greil nurses his jaw

                         its the equinox

               they both look up at the moon

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country  night

               the moon shines down on the far reaches of the kingdom of 
               urland coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the 
               skeletons of dead trees blackened rock and bare ground 
               advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed 
               men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril the horse is 
               skittish finally in spite of shouts and lashings it refuses 
               to go further the leader horsrik barks out an order

                                     horsrik
                         close enough! bring her out!

               a young woman no more than seventeen is brought forth from 
               the cart long black hair falls down over a white tunic her 
               dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face she is 
               halfcarried half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack 
               in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post by 
               lanternlight horsrik reads from a parchment scroll

                                     horsrik
                         now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom that this maiden having 
                         lawfully been chosen by a deed of 
                         fortune and destiny shall hereby 
                         give up her life for the greater 
                         good of urland

               there is a low rumble the earth shakes horsrik glances 
               nervously around he carries on by rote

                                     horsrik
                         by this act shall be satisfied the 
                         powers that dwell underground and 
                         the spirits that attend thereto in 
                         gratitude for this sacrifice his 
                         majesty has declared the family  
                         whats the name 

               he prods the girl but she is too terrified to speak beneath 
               them the earth seems to groan smoke issues from the mouth 
               of the pit one of the nervous witnesses leans forward

                                     retainer
                         plowman! the family plowman!

                                     horsrik
                              rushing it
                          the family plowman to be free of 
                         obligations taxations levys and 
                         imposts for a period not to exceed 
                         five years

               the horse suddenly rears and blindfold notwithstanding 
               gallops off dragging the tumbril over the rocks the men 
               behind horsrik break ranks and scatter

                                     horsrik
                          ordained and signed this day 
                         etc casiodorus in his glory the 
                         reigning king of this our realm 
                         his seal his mark duly read by 
                         chancellor horsrik in his holy name

               now horsrik joins the flight chasing his men back over the 
               murky horizon

               the girl

               she strains against her manacles cocking her head to listen 
               as the rumblings below subside presently the steam and smoke 
               blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a 
               hundred yards distant the wheel of the cart jammed between 
               rocks summoning up a wild will to live she squeezes her 
               hands against the cold iron rings no use she spits on her 
               wrists and twists desperately blood starts one hand slips 
               free she looks at the horse the animal tosses off its 
               blindfold and looks back at her now she strains again and 
               pulls her other hand free she wipes the blood on her frock 
               and sprints toward the horse but she doesnt get there the 
               earth abruptly shifts from under her feet tumbling her among 
               cracked and steaming rocks when she raises her head a huge 
               shadow has fallen over the horse there is a piteous whinny 
               then a roar the girls face is suddenly lit by flames she 
               scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way

               the chase

               the girl hasnt taken a dozen steps when something huge 
               hurtles forward and blocks her way something scaly and 
               glittering she whirls and stumbles off in a new direction 
               this time shes cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier
               like talons she screams and crawls away another claw 
               prevents her escape

               the creature

               membranous wings fold down against the night sky up comes 
               the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine 
               neck theres an angry hiss a sheet of flame envelops 
               everything

                                                                  fade out

               fade in

               forest  day

               tyrian kneels beside a mountain waterfall having a drink 
               while his men hover in the background one of them points 
               down the slope

                                     man

               tyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to look 
               far below half hidden by trees the little company of 
               urlanders winds its way through the forest

               a frown creeps over tyrians face

                                     tyrian

               he glances over and discovers galen missing

               galen

               he walks back along the trail looking for valerian pretty 
               soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight he hears 
               the sound of a splash he turns off the trail and pushes 
               through some shrubbery

               forest pool

               under the oaks and hickory a forest stream has widened into 
               a quiet pool a pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge 
               out in the middle valerian is treading water

                                     galen

               galen leans over and splashes some water on his face feels 
               good he shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes 
               valerian doesnt like it

                                     valerian
                         thats all right dont come in

               but galen is now naked and walking into the water he swims 
               out toward valerian

                                     valerian
                              edgy

               galen keeps swimming

                                     valerian
                         i prefer to swim alone if you dont 
                         mind

               but galen has slipped beneath the surface he doesnt hear

               underwater

               galen works his way through the murky green underwater world 
               suddenly he stops short and stares hes only a few feet 
               from valerians dangling legs he gasps in surprise valerian 
               is no boy

               on the surface

               galen comes shooting to the surface coughing and sputtering

                                     galen
                         by the gods!

               valerian is pale and frightened

                         stay away

               she propels herself backward then turns and swims for shore

               on the shore

               galen and valerian have taken refuge behind separate bushes 
               briskly they pull on their clothes

                                     valerian

               he studies her she jams a hat down over her head and once 
               more the young man stalks off

               the vision

               galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his 
               pack as he leans over he catches sight of what appears to 
               be a reflection in the water tyrian on horseback he whips 
               around but no one is behind him riveted by the vision he 
               hurries along the bank to follow it after a few paces the 
               blurry figure dismounts unslings a longbow nocks an arrow 
               and draws the string taut

                                     galen
                              horrified
                         no!

               forest

               galen sprints through the trees up ahead is valerian walking 
               resolutely

                                     galen
                         no!

               she glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking galen 
               shoots past her and on into the forest

                                     galen
                         hodge!

               travelers

               galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the urlanders 
               coming toward him hodge precedes the group with an unsteady 
               gait he sees galen raises up his arms and flops face down 
               on the trail a long arrow protrudes from his back galen 
               kneels beside him the uneasy company keeps its distance 
               hodge struggles to speak

                                     hodge
                         galen can you hear me

                         can still talk theres something 
                         that has to be done

                                     galen
                         i know

                                     hodge

                         here

               hodges hand comes out from under his coat gripping the 
               leather pouch galen tugs at it but hodge cant let go

                                     hodge
                         take it sorry youll have to peel 
                         it loose

               galen pries the sack out of hodges clenched fingers suddenly 
               the hand comes up grabs galen by the hair and pulls him 
               near

                                     hodge
                              a croak

                         throw it in

                                     galen
                              holding up the pouch
                         what are you doing with this hodge

                                     hodge
                         burning water

               he dies galen frees himself from his grasp

                                     galen
                         hodge dont die listen to me youre 
                         not going to die

               galen is frantic he pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand 
               around it

                                     galen
                         excede mortem! revoca vitam!
                              he shakes the body
                         excede mortem! revoca vitam!

               but hodge has passed on and galens magic has no way to 
               reach him suddenly the youth cries out in pain he drops 
               the amulet and looks at his palm the device has burned his 
               flesh now he becomes aware of troubled urlanders looking 
               over his shoulder witness to his failure

                                                                    cut to

               lake  day

               wind whips the leaden wave tops on a vast rainy lake the 
               travelers are rowing across in an open longboat aided by a 
               tattered lateen sail valerian mans the steering oar at the 
               stern while galen broods in the bow he feels like an imposter 
               in their eyes

               fjord

               the boat pulls into a long narrow waterway with granite cliffs 
               on either side moving through swirls of fog they beach the 
               boat and step out onto a craggy shore greil leans over and 
               kisses a rock

                                     greil
                         urland!

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country  day

               the travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a 
               wrack of cloud into a gray and cheerless region fire
               blackened trees dot the barren landscape as they reach the 
               flatlands the urlanders instinctively pick up the pace 
               galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings valerian trots 
               past him

                                     valerian
                         come on dont dawdle here

               galen falls into step with her

                                     galen
                         the whole kingdom like this

                                     valerian
                         no were near the lair keep moving

               galen looks around with new interest

                                     galen
                         where

                                     valerian
                         over there doesnt matter were in 
                         no danger if we just pass through 
                         quickly

               galen stops high on the slope beside them is a gaping 
               fissure

                                     galen
                         i see it lets have a look

                                     valerian
                         no!

               but galen is already toiling up the incline

                                     valerian
                         greil! malkin! help!

               the travelers turn to see whats the matter

               the lair

               galen approaches the lair pausing beside a wooden post with 
               iron manacles dangling from it he fingers them thoughtfully 
               malkin greil and valerian rush up behind him their faces 
               drawn with worry

                                     greil
                         look you dont have to do this we 
                         know youre a fine young magician 
                         none better theres no need to prove 
                         it to us

                                     galen
                         are there other entrances

                                     valerian
                         no ones enough

                                     greil
                         come on the roads this way well 
                         tell everybody how close you got

                                     galen
                              coolly
                         no smoke how do you know its in 
                         there

                                     greil
                         dont be a fool come away now and 
                         live to tell about it

               instead galen starts into the crack greil and malkin hasten 
               away but valerian lingers watching in mounting frustration 
               as galen probes further and further into the lair she picks 
               up a fistful of stones and throws them at him

                                     valerian
                         go ahead! youre going to die! what 
                         a fine trick that will be!

               but galen is lost in the gloom she flees

               underground

               galen puts his hand on the rugged wall the rocks are hot to 
               the touch something glinting on the floor catches galens 
               eye an irridescent disk a dragon scale it flashes the 
               colors of the rainbow as galen examines it all at once the 
               ground shudders chunks of rock fall from the ceiling a 
               pall of smoke billows up from the depths

               outside

               galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a 
               swirl of smoke there is no sign of the urlanders he throws 
               down his pack climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the 
               massive cliffs rising behind the lair he grasps the amulet 
               and closes his eyes

                                     galen
                         now great mountain hear my command 
                         terrae lapsus consignet latibulum 
                         draconis! evanescat latibulum 
                         draconis!

               landslide

               with a thunderous splitting sound the entire top of the 
               cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the 
               mountain sweeping tons of debris into the air boulders the 
               size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician 
               eyes wide with awe he turns and runs for his life even as 
               he careens down the slope chunks of rock rumble past one 
               catches him at the knee and sends him flying

               he covers his head and joins the landslide finally the dust 
               lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the 
               cowering urlanders they look with real fear at the man who 
               just conjured up the apocalypse tattered and torn covered 
               with dirt galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at 
               his handiwork

               landscape

               the territory has been drastically transformed the dragons 
               lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite 
               the urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction 
               galen grins a triumphant splitlip grin that fails to win 
               them over presently they back away and run off down the 
               trail valerian in their midst galens grin fades

                                                                    cut to

               village  day

               the village of swanscombe is little more than a rough and 
               ready collection of thatched huts and muddaubed outbuildings 
               surrounded by cultivated fields dogs sleep in open door
               ways chickens peck around the communal well  but there 
               are no people in evidence as valerian and her company troop 
               into town

               valerian

               she trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith 
               shop

                                     valerian
                         father hello

               she goes over to the forge hot coals are burning she becomes 
               aware of a sound  voices  chanting

               square

               she walks across the square toward the voices she is joined 
               by greil malkin and the other travelers all of them puzzled 
               by the desolation as they approach the grange hall the voices 
               grow louder they seem to be singing the main doors open 
               briefly and three villagers scamper out dripping wet and 
               wrapped in white muslin valerian and her companions look at 
               each other in astonishment

               in the grange hall

               in a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is 
               being held under water after a few moments she is pulled to 
               the surface by a tall redhaired man with long bony fingers 
               brother jacopus januensis a carthusian monk theres a wooden 
               cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye gathered around 
               him are the missing villagers every man woman and child 
               here to be baptised and sing a few newlylearned hymns in 
               praise of our lord jesus christ

                                     brother jacopus

                         spirit into the fellowship of jesus 
                         christ!

               the travelers enter and mingle with the congregation valerian 
               scans the crowd until she locates her father simon a balding 
               sturdy journeyman hes overjoyed at her return and gives 
               her a hearty embrace

                                     simon

               monk

               brother jacopus strides back and forth before the assembly 
               in an inspired state

               few adults entertaining them by pulling ducks eggs out of 
               their ears and causing coins to disappear presently he feels 
               the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing 
               behind him he turns to find a shy but determined valerian 
               sweetly decked out in her blue frock a buzz goes through 
               the crowd valerian blushes and wavers she seems ready to 
               bolt for home but galen takes her by the hand and with

                         looks like youve been up to a little 
                         sorcery yourself

               valerian doesnt know what to say

                                     galen

               simon & greil

               they stand on the sidelines watching the young couple step 
               to the music

                                     simon

                         chamberpot isnt it strange that at 
                         the very moment the beast is put 
                         down we should have a holy man here

                         mysterious ways

               celebration

               while the proud simon dances in the background with his 
               daughter a group of tipsy villagers clusters around galen 
               belching forth a drinking song the young magician raises 
               his own mug and joins in on the chorus abruptly the music 
               stops the singing dies away the ensuing silence is broken 
               by the sound of galloping hooves presently three horsemen 
               appear at the end of town tyrian and his henchmen they 
               guide their horses forward into the midst of the merrymakers 
               tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way

                                     tyrian

                         account you  musicians more music!

               the musicians leave their instruments in their laps tyrian 
               draws himself a measure of ale and raises it above his head

                                     tyrian
                         a toast! to the deed of the day! you

                         overcome with joy

                                     malkin

                              he gestures toward 
                              galen
                         the king would meet our new benefactor 
                         and offer his gratitude to the man 
                         who succeeded where so many have 
                         failed

                                     galen
                              sobering up
                         what sort of gratitude a knife in 
                         the belly an arrow in the back

               tyrians smile freezes on his face he steps in front of 
               galen towering over him

                                     tyrian

                         otherwise

                                     valerian

                         easy thats what they are

               tyrian regards her coolly taking in her change of costume 
               and its meaning

                                     tyrian
                         well well still plenty of cheek 
                         under those skirts it seems

               having buried the dragon under a mountain galen decides 
               hes not worried about an appearance at court he smiles at 
               valerian

                                     galen
                         dont worry ill be back

               riders

               three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central 
               urland galen is tucked up behind tyrian on the distant 
               horizon the battlements of the kings castle glow in the 
               slanting light of a new day

                                                                    cut to

               throne room  day

               within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight 
               poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls in 
               the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne there is 
               casiodorus rex king of urland a bearded man in his fifties 
               as spare and somber as the room in which he sits he is 
               flanked by a few servants assorted courtiers and tyrian 
               standing before them all is galen looking unhappy he pours 
               a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet

                                     galen
                         one of the best things about the 
                         water here in urland is that theres 
                         so much of it  look at that!

               water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing 
               galen takes a sip

                                     galen
                         mmm good but not cold enough 
                         perhaps i could borrow a scarf from 
                         his majesty

               the king makes no sign galen approaches stiffly takes a 
               scarf and retreats

                                     galen
                         i cover the goblet so remove 
                         so and behold winter in a mug!

               and hes done it he turns the goblet over and a small chunk 
               of ice hits the floor the royal reaction is equally frosty 
               galen is bombing and he knows it

                                     galen
                         all right how many of you have ever 
                         seen a table fly

               he mutters an incantation in the audience tyrian notes 
               that galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet there is 
               a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins 
               to jitter and buck as the wine spills and plates go flying 
               the king wearily raises a hand

                                     king
                         enough! thats fine

                                     galen
                         wait itll rise now

                                     king
                         dont bother not necessary

               the table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and 
               crockery at the onlookers feet

                                     king
                         tell me the landslide  it was 
                         accomplished this same way

                                     galen
                         yes

                                     king
                         i see and having rendered such unique 
                         service to our kingdom what would 
                         you claim as a reward

                                     galen
                         please  no payment i have always 
                         found magical practice to be its own 
                         reward i seek only some yet greater 
                         challenge

               this handsome sentiment doesnt go over any better than his 
               tricks

                                     king
                         did you ever hear of king gaiseric 
                         of course not you werent even born 
                         he was my brother a great king and 
                         a valiant manatarms when he 
                         ascended to the throne the dragon 
                         was unbridled no one knew where it 
                         might strike next so he brought 
                         forth his broadsword and his spear 
                         assembled a company of his best 
                         fighters and went out to do battle
                              pause
                         he was never seen again but his 
                         attack provoked the most terrible 
                         reprisals whole villages incinerated 
                         entire crops burned death famine 
                         horrible

               the king grimaces as the memories come flooding back

                                     king
                              quietly
                         how did you arrogate to yourself the 
                         role of savior

                                     galen
                         i was invited

                                     king
                         not by me did you ever consider the 
                         consequences of failure

                                     galen
                         what failure whats the matter with 
                         you people you want the dragon back

                                     king
                         then the beast is dead

                                     galen
                         yes of course dead

                                     king

                                                                    cut to

               dungeon

               two guards thrust galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred 
               door shut the young sorcerer waits until theyre safely out 
               of sight then takes out his amulet he ponders it for a 
               doubtful moment suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips 
               it off his neck and out through the bars

                                     tyrian
                         thank you

               he makes an ironic salute and leaves galen sits down heavily 
               and stares at the stone walls

               corridor

               unseen by galen a figure clad in silk and lace skitters 
               down a murky dungeon hallway and peers around a corner 
               stealing a look at galen is the princess elspeth a fey beauty 
               in her early twenties after a moment spooked by some 
               imagined noise she flits away

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country  day

               dark clouds slide across a pale sun throwing the ruined 
               land below into shadow soon fat droplets of rain are 
               splattering on the rocks above the dragons lair with each 
               tiny splash there is a sizzle and a puff of steam these 
               rocks are hot!

                                                                    cut to

               dungeon

               outside the barred window a steady rain is falling inside 
               galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on 
               the floor of his cell he marks runic signs on the window 
               sill and lintel then positioning himself in the center of 
               the mystic symbol he raises his hands and spreads his 
               fingers

                                     galen
                              authoritative
                         cubiculum gravis aperat!

               theres a long moment when nothing happens a very long 
               moment finally a thoroughly frustrated galen leaps to the 
               window and rattles the bars

                                     galen
                         open up dammit! fenestra gravis 
                         aperat! asser gravis aperat! 
                         divinitus!

                                     voice
                         salve magistrum iuvenilum

               startled galen whirls around to find elspeth standing outside 
               his cell she hands some food and blankets through the bars

                                     elspeth

                         vale dormi bene

               she slips away down the corridor

               library

               king casiodorus and tyrian are huddled over a table piled 
               high with manuscripts and papers tyrian clears a spot and 
               sets out a stack of lead bars

                                     king
                         thats enough lets not be greedy 
                         here

               the king picks up galens amulet and holds it over the bars 
               in his clenched fist

                                     king
                         now then i casiodorus rex do hereby 
                         command thou base metal to change 
                         thy essence and become gold

               there is a rustle of skirts and elspeth appears behind him

                                     elspeth
                         father

                         father did you know that some 
                         families have paid bribes to stay 
                         out of the lottery

               the king and tyrian glance up at her

                                     king
                         nonsense by the power of this amulet 
                         justly wielded by my hand in 
                         accordance with the laws of urland 
                         now lead be thou gold

               the lead remains unchanged but the king gives out a cry and 
               drops the amulet

                                     king
                         im burned! what devilish thing is 
                         this

                         have you ever kept my name off the 
                         lottery list

                                     king
                         thatll be all tyrian you may 
                         withdraw

               tyrian bows and exits the king uses his sceptre to pick up 
               the amulet and chain he conceals it in a hollowedout book 
               and places the volume on a shelf among many others

                                     king
                         now my dear whats troubling you

                                     elspeth

                         to the same risk as every other mans 
                         daughter

               the king paces over to the window and stares out the rain 
               has stopped

                                     elspeth
                         well

                                     king
                              finally
                         your father loves you very much

               elspeth sways in dismay

                                     elspeth
                              a wail
                         its true! what have you done to 
                         me!

                                     king
                         who fills your head with such ideas

               at that moment a tremor passes through the room king and 
               daughter look at each other in alarm

               dungeon

               the same tremor shakes the bars in galens cell puzzled he 
               rolls off his straw palette and gets to his feet the tremor 
               dies away suddenly a violent shaking hits the cell bouncing 
               galen off the walls

               swanscombe is gripped by the same earthquake dodging panicky 
               barnyard animals valerian and her father join other 
               frightened villagers in the center of town

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country

               above the dragons lair boulders are shifting and grinding 
               together massive chunks of stone break loose and tumble 
               down the incline

                                                                    cut to

               galen

               the shaking has stopped rock dust filters down from the 
               ceiling galen picks himself up and stares the door to his 
               cell is off its hinges and is sagging open he darts out

               corridor

               galen dashes along the hallway rounds a corner and stops 
               at the other end of the passage is tyrian

                                     tyrian
                         you little meddler! its alive!

               he draws his sword and advances galen warily retreats tyrian 
               breaks into a run galen turns and sprints away

               courtyard

               unruly horses terrified by the quake rush blindly around 
               the courtyard hostlers try vainly to catch them tyrian 
               leans down from an upstairs window

                                     tyrian
                         close the main gate! quick!

               the men below scramble for the gates galen bursts out of 
               hiding sees the untended horses and swings aboard as one 
               goes past a cry goes up from the guards

                                     tyrian
                         there! stop him!

               galen rides like mad for the exit but hes a halfsecond 
               late the doors boom shut in his face he wheels the horse 
               around the kings men are coming toward him with pikes 
               digging his heels into the horses sides he urges the animal 
               back across the courtyard up the steps and right into the 
               building!

               throne room

               galen gallops into the empty chamber knocking over the throne 
               and vaulting a table hot on his heels are armed soldiers 
               he kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway

               kitchen

               the kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when 
               galen charges in on his wild steed food utensils and cooks 
               go flying he reins in ducks his head and squeezes the 
               horse out into a narrow hallway

               hallway

               he clatters down the passageway but here comes a contingent 
               of footmen from the opposite direction galen rides them 
               into the walls!

               stairs

               the horse scrabbles up the stairs galen tucked low against 
               its neck on the upper landing he comes face to face with 
               tyrian and more soldiers

                                     tyrian
                         get him! stab the horse!

               galen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the 
               stairs

               library

               whinnying and blowing the horse bursts in a wildeyed galen 
               still in the saddle he finds himself confronting the king 
               and his daughter

               casiodorus grabs elspeth and retreats into a corner

                                     king
                         tyrian! tyrian!

               tyrian sweeps in with his men the doors slam shut

                                     king
                         so much for your magic! so much for 
                         your sorcery!

               galen is trapped just as tyrian reaches for the horses 
               reins the animal rears up rolling its eyes at that moment 
               the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks the 
               men at arms go down like ten pins tyrian reels back dodging 
               stone blocks loosened from the ceiling as the shaking 
               continues a weakened section of wall gives way galen sees 
               daylight! without even waiting for the quake to cease he 
               prods the horse across the room and through the wall to 
               freedom

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country  day

               the unnerved citizens of swanscombe gather on the promontory 
               overlooking galens landslide every few seconds there is a 
               new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope valerian 
               stands trembling with her father presently brother jacopus 
               elbows his way forward

                                     brother jacopus
                         listen to me my brethren the moment 
                         of our fear is the moment of our 
                         triumph this is a sign from god 
                         follow me and our faith will send 
                         this creature straight to hell

               holding a cross before him he starts up the slope no one 
               follows they havent been christians all that long one or 
               two near valerian get down on their knees and pray silently 
               greil looks things over

                                     greil
                         you call yourselves christians

               he strides after the monk but hes the only one

               near the lair

               the determined monk has arrived at the epicenter his sandals 
               are smoking on the hot gravel sweat shines on his face and 
               neck

                                     brother jacopus

                         want thou makest me to lie down in 
                         green pastures thy rod and staff 
                         they comfort me

               greil toils up the slope a hundred yards back hes crossing 
               himself but hes carrying a sickle

               vermithrax

               there is a thunderous noise part of the mountain is tossed 
               into the air up from the depths comes a huge shining wing 
               then a neck uncoils and a head appears it tips down toward 
               the tiny human

                                     brother jacopus
                              firm
                         for thine is the kingdom and the 
                         power and the glory forever  amen

               at the base of the slope the villagers scatter greil wavers

                                     brother jacopus
                         unclean beast get thee down! be 
                         thou consumed by the fires that made 
                         you!

               the dragons head sways back and forth then belches out a 
               waterfall of flame it engulfs jacopus and sends him to a 
               better world if there is one

                                                                    cut to

               hill road  night

               horse and rider race across a night landscape under brooding 
               clouds up ahead the sky glows with an angry red light at 
               the crest of a hill galen reins in and looks down across a 
               long valley there miles away is the village of swanscombe 
               many buildings are ablaze as he watches in horror fires 
               spring up in the fields and trees intermittently he can see 
               the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction 
               finally the creature swoops up and away galen stares skyward 
               losing sight of it in the clouds for a moment silence 
               then with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him 
               from the saddle the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet 
               over his head! it is gone in an instant

                                                                    cut to

               village  night

               half the buildings in the town are on fire desperate 
               villagers dash here and there herding children and animals 
               to safety trying to save their household goods galen walks 
               woodenly into the confusion leading his horse taking in 
               the scope of the disaster he comes upon a line of men who 
               have formed a bucket brigade he attempts to join up as 
               soon as he is recognized he is shouldered roughly aside

                                     man
                         get away you little bastard weve 
                         had enough help from you

               galen staggers back reaching for his horse the animal shies 
               and trots off a middleaged woman appears in front of him 
               her face contorted with rage she swings a flaming broom and 
               catches him on the back of the head galen reels away

                                     woman
                         this is your doing!

               galen looks up and sees a couple of burlies moving his way 
               with boards in their hands

                                     burlies
                         get him! hes back!

               before they can get too close galen runs down an alley and 
               bumps smack into a glassyeyed haunted man it is greil

                                     galen
                         greil  help!

                                     greil
                         may the lord forgive you for what 
                         you have done

               he pushes past galen ducks behind a smoldering building

               valerians house

               the roof has burned off but at least the walls are standing 
               valerian is wrestling charred timbers out of the center of 
               the room she is covered with soot there is a hammering on 
               the door and galen barges in he slams the door behind him 
               and puts his back against it

                                     galen

                         what why not

               galens hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang

                                     galen
                         i just cant

               for a moment valerian is too stunned to speak then her 
               face colors

                                     valerian

                         damn thing is loose were all on 
                         fire and youre sorry!

               galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes

                                     valerian
                         you didnt have the faintest idea

                         a fool  and im a bigger one for 
                         bringing you here

               she snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him

                                     valerian
                         i dont want you in this house get 
                         out

               but galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings 
               cut every dream of glory utterly crushed this piteous sight 
               touches valerians heart her gaze softens she slowly lowers 
               the pitchfork

                                                                  fade out

               fade in

               town square  day

               a knot of villagers lead tyrian and his henchmen across the 
               square directly to the blacksmiths shop the kings men 
               dismount and pound on the door it swings open valerian is 
               standing there

                                     tyrian
                         where is he

                                     valerian

               a cry goes up from the villagers they know damn well hes 
               in there

               valerians house

               tyrian pushes valerian aside and steps into the room aided 
               by some townfolk his men proceed to ransack the premises 
               overturning barrels sticking their swords through flour 
               sacks poking through the tumbledown thatch valerians eye 
               falls on malkin who has involved himself in the search

                                     valerian
                         you too

                         damn right

               finding nothing the group pushes into the metal shop where 
               simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an 
               enormous anvil he lays down his tools and grimly watches 
               the men go through overturning benches and tables tyrian 
               props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to simon

                         to know that the king has called for

                         exceptions

               the search party has exhausted the rooms hiding places

                                     henchman
                         nothing if he was here hes gone 
                         now

               tyrian nods and leads the way out simon catches up and pulls 
               tyrian aside at the door

                                     simon
                         all right i know what you want how

                         are you offering me a bribe

                                     simon
                         yes

                                     tyrian
                         dont waste your time
                              pause
                         you could never afford it

               he spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of 
               town valerian and simon watch them go when the riders are 
               out of sight they return to the shop with a couple of stout 
               poles they strain to lift the anvil off its base finally 
               it topples over valerian slides the base aside revealing a 
               trap door she raises it and a cramped galen unfolds himself 
               from the space below on his face is a curious look of 
               determination

                                     galen
                         smith  have you ever forged a 
                         weapon

               weapons

               simon is going through a cabinet tossing out hoes rakes 
               sickles scythes plow blades and a knife or two galen 
               examines them doubtfully now simon produces an armload of 
               swords galen is impressed he looks them over carefully 
               testing and rejecting them in turn

                                     galen
                         these are your sharpest

               simon plucks up one of the swords carries it to the center 
               of the room he lays a horseshoe on the anvil he brings the 
               sword down  whack!  and cuts the horseshoe in half

                                     simon
                         even tyrian carries one of these

               galen hefts it dubiously

                                     galen
                         its sharp  but its not sharp 
                         enough

               valerian has been watching all this with growing concern

                                     valerian
                         not sharp enough for what

                                     galen
                         for what im going to do with it

                                     valerian
                         nothings that sharp

               simon gnaws his lip reluctantly he brings a long box from 
               the bottom of the cabinet he opens it lying on a bed of 
               silk is an exquisite twohanded broadsword the flat blade 
               gleams like a mirror galen reaches in and lifts it out

                                     simon
                         the best i ever made

               valerian is as awed as galen

                                     valerian
                         its beautiful

               galen brings up a finger to test the edge simon grabs his 
               hand away

                                     simon
                         dont do that!
                              he looks at valerian
                         girlchild when you were born i 
                         knew i had to do something so i set 
                         about the task of fashioning an 
                         extraordinary weapon i had the skill 
                         to make it 
                              bleak pause
                          but not the nerve to use it

               she looks at him with affection leaning forward she plants 
               a kiss on his bald pate

                                     valerian
                         im thankful for that
                              to galen
                         no man should choose a senseless 
                         death

                                                                    cut to

               stream  day

               galen valerian and simon tramp through a glade to a mossy 
               bank there a wide stream flows lazily under a canopy of 
               trees

                                     valerian
                         if its me youre worried about

                         girls my name just wont be drawn 
                         i know it wont

               galen walks out into the shallows and pushes the swordtip 
               into the sandy bottom angled so that the edge splits the 
               current

                                     galen
                         valerian this isnt just for your 
                         sake

               he walks back to shore all three watch the sword to see 
               what will happen

               sword

               big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current very 
               slowly they go by the sword some of them very close 
               finally one of them floats against the leading edge of the 
               blade and without a ripple is cleft in two simon gives galen 
               a significant look

                                     valerian
                         i dont care it doesnt matter 
                         what you want to kill isnt flesh 
                         and blood

                                     simon
                         oh itll bleed all right

                                     valerian
                         how do you know no ones so much as 
                         even scratched it

               they look to galen the apprentices face is full of doubt

                                     galen
                         ill need the amulet

                                                                    cut to

               maiden daughters  gather from all over the country in the 
               courtyard of the kings castle simon is there with valerian 
               and so is galen disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide
               brimmed hat like many others he carries a stick topped 
               with a bleached skull  to all appearances just another 
               participant in this weird pagan ritual a barrel decorated 
               with flames and dragons wings sits on a raised dais in front 
               of the main entrance horsrik the kings herald supervises 
               preparations for the lottery armed guards appear carrying a 
               sealed chest horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour 
               the contents  hundreds of wooden tiles each bearing the 
               name of a potential sacrifice  into the barrel trumpets 
               blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage 
               the king his daughter courtiers and tyrian valerian nudges 
               galen

                                     valerian
                              pointing
                         look at her the princess

                                     galen
                         i know weve met

               valerian gives galen a sharp look horsrik unrolls a 
               parchment

                                     horsrik
                              reading
                         people of urland whereas the peace 
                         of the kingdom has been disrupted by 
                         the mischief of an interloper and 
                         whereas this interloper being fled 
                         now therefore his majesty the king 
                         hereby proclaims the sum of thirty 
                         ducats to be paid to anyone producing 
                         the miscreant galen bradwardyn fraud 
                         enchanter to our satisfaction

               galen pulls his hat low over his eyes as the moment for the 
               drawing approaches valerian becomes more and more uneasy 
               she pushes forward through the crowd until shes just below 
               the barrel she eyes the people around her some of them 
               seem equally worried others  the better dressed and better 
               fed  are smug and complacent the king and his retinue are 
               serene a chant goes up from the crowd

                                     crowd
                         stir the tiles! stir the tiles!

               horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved 
               dragons head and stirs up the names this done a new chant 
               goes up

                                     crowd
                         bare the arm! bare the arm!

               at a signal a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from 
               horsriks right arm he holds it high the crowd surges 
               forward the atmosphere is full of dread and excitement 
               valerian looking pale and determined is jostled and pushed 
               to the edge of the platform

                                     crowd
                         draw the name! draw the name!

               the moment has come down goes horsriks arm and up it comes 
               holding one little wooden square one young womans fate an 
               expectant hush falls over the mob the virgins of urland 
               tremble and wait

                                     horsrik
                         now my countrymen hear me behold 
                         for i am chosen i shall die that 
                         many may live i shall lay down my 
                         life for family and fellows i shall 
                         go to my grave for the love of our 
                         king and his wise policy and my 
                         name is 

               he looks down at the tile to read the name but no sound 
               comes to his lips he looks back at the crowd a cold sweat 
               breaking over his face he swallows but still cant bring 
               himself to speak at his feet valerian is holding her breath 
               a new chant goes up

                                     crowd
                         the name! the name!

               by now horsrik is trembling he stares down at the tile his 
               mouth set in a grim line the king is getting annoyed he 
               gestures and the crowd falls silent

                                     king
                         read the name

                                     horsrik
                              mastering himself
                         the name is princess elspeth ulfilas 
                         filia regis

               there is a moment of profound shock then a low murmur of 
               wonder moves through the crowd galen looks at valerian she 
               sags with relief the king turns to his daughter she shows 
               nothing he rises from his chair comes forward and snatches 
               the tile from horsrik

                                     king
                         thats not the name its been 
                         misread

               valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy

                                     valerian
                         theres no mistake! the names been 
                         chosen  let it stand!

                                     king
                         no the good horsrik has misspoke 
                         himself
                              he looks at the tile
                         in fairness to this individual whose 
                         name i cant make out well destroy 
                         this tile

               he quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow 
               led by valerian the crowd cries out in protest

                                     valerian
                         no! what better name than your own 
                         kin at last we see justice done!

                                     king
                         silence! we will have a new choosing 
                         i will draw the name myself

               he reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile he 
               looks at it and his eyes widen betrayed he swivels to face 
               his daughter the din of the crowd reaches a crescendo

                                     crowd
                         let it stand! let it stand!

               elspeth takes the tile from her fathers nerveless fingers 
               looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft

                                     elspeth
                         the name is as you heard it and as 
                         horsrik read it elspeth

               the king moils through the tiles finding his daughters 
               name again and again

                                     king
                         the lottery is invalid another and 
                         another what treachery is this

               valerian chanting with the rest falls silent she looks at 
               elspeth with sudden interest and respect then awe

                                     elspeth
                         hear me good people! it is true 
                         that my name appears on many of the 
                         lots this does not falsify the 
                         drawing it certifies it! i have 
                         learned that my name has been kept 
                         from jeopardy in all the drawings in 
                         the past so i have put my name among 
                         the rest many times  once for each 
                         risk that over the years you took 
                         and i did not

               the crowd is dumbfounded gradually voices erupt in a 
               cacophony of shouts whistles and excited conversation galen 
               sees his chance theres an unguarded door near the stable 
               he drifts toward it and slips inside

               throne room

               galen pokes his head in the room is empty he scurries over 
               to a chest flings it open and starts rummaging finding 
               nothing he moves on to a cabinet he breaks the lock and 
               pries it open again nothing

               castle corridor

               galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down 
               a hall suddenly he stops short there in front of him is a 
               guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings galen 
               hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves 
               but the man is only headed for another window and a better 
               view galen manages to fall into step an arms length behind 
               him and slip by without a sound

               library

               galen enters the library his enormous shadow dancing crazily 
               on the torchlit walls hurrying through his attention is 
               drawn to some open books on a table closer inspection reveals 
               magical writings and symbols galen paws over everything 
               suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet but where 
               is it

               courtyard

               as the crowd disperses valerian watches elspeth walk back in 
               the castle lofty and composed she looks for galen and 
               discovers he has gone

               library

               by now the room is in total disarray galen has opened all 
               the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the 
               shelves no amulet hes feverishly working on a locked drawer 
               when a voice interrupts him

                                     king
                         dont go to all that trouble

               galen whirls around to find the king standing in the doorway 
               the monarch looks shattered galen edges toward the split in 
               the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers 
               at that moment tyrian comes through the door sizes up the 
               situation and draws his sword

                                     galen
                         im unarmed if you want a fight at 
                         least give me a weapon

                                     tyrian
                              pushing by the king
                         i think not!

                                     king

                              to galen
                         and you  dont run away please

               the kings voice is cracking galen and tyrian are equally 
               taken aback the king searches through the books remaining 
               on the library shelves

                                     king

                         admiration for the black arts you 
                         chaps with your mysterious spells 
                         i didnt think it would be necessary 
                         you see vermithrax is an old dragon 
                         and that i thought was the beauty

                         thats still going to happen

               the king finds the book and takes the amulet out with 
               trembling hands he passes it to galen

                                     tyrian

                         on the cross he was scourged by 
                         evil but he showed no fear such is 
                         the power of the holy ghost

               blacksmith shop

               galen lurks in the shadows of simons metal shop looking out 
               on the square where greil is holding forth

                                     greil
                         of what avail is magic the old gods

                         comest my help my help comest from 
                         the lord!

               galen quietly shuts and bars the door he moves deeper into 
               the gloomy workroom where simon is pumping a bellows to heat 
               up the forge galen looks at the coals

                                     simon
                         good and hot

                                     galen
                         dont bother thats not the kind of 
                         fire we need

               valerian is staring at the sword sitting on the anvil in 
               its silk wrapping galen uncovers it holds it high and 
               puts his hand on the amulet

                                     galen
                         nunc per potestatem hermeticum  
                         ex flammis ferrum sangrinarium!

               the sword starts to hum and to heat up from the hilt outward 
               the blade glows brighter and brighter red orange white 
               it lights up the room throwing long shadows into the corners 
               galen lays the white hot steel on the anvil simon takes up 
               his hammer and begins the reforging valerian sees their 
               resolve after watching for several moments she slips out 
               the side door looking sad

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country  day

               clouds scud low over the lifeless region the dragons lair 
               now has a newer bigger entrance vapors drift upward from 
               it down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock 
               to rock its valerian with a wicker basket on her arm 
               searching for dragon scales the basket is already more than 
               half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of 
               the cavern shes about to turn back when she spies a 
               particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards 
               further on as she reaches for it there is a sudden hiss! 
               she jerks her hand back and freezes there in the shadows is 
               a baby dragon a basilisk all coppery bronze with stubby 
               winglets as she backs away she sees two more come up to 
               join the first they watch her retreat through wicked little 
               green eyes

                                                                    cut to

               stream  day

               on the mossy bank galen and simon unwrap the reforged sword 
               now the blade carries a faint blue halation galen walks to 
               the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down 
               into the sand then he rejoins simon onshore to await results 
               this time as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge they 
               gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact such 
               is the power of the sword that even after many leaves not a 
               single one has come close enough to be sliced simon is agog 
               and even galen seems satisfied they clasp hands

                                     simon
                         an edge like no other on this earth

                                     galen
                         well done simon thank you

               simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment

                                     simon
                              grave

               they look at each other for what could be the last time

                         fare thee well

               the old man departs galen unfolds the bundle and brings out 
               its contents mail hauberk with coif studded leather gloves 
               padded jerkin a scabbard and a small wooden shield he lays 
               them out on the stream bank then strips off his tunic and 
               kneels down to splash some water in his face as the cups 
               the water between his hands an image comes alive and shimmers 
               on the surface valerian stripping off her own clothes 
               shyly turning toward him solemn and romantic

                                     valerian
                         galen

               its as if the vision is speaking to him but its not he 
               spins around and sees her standing there fully clothed and 
               possessed of a brisk and businesslike air

                                     valerian
                         here

               she throws down a shield its remarkable in its construction  
               overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have been 
               ingeniously fastened to a leatherclad frame

                                     valerian

               galen turns the shield over and over marveling at it he 
               fixes her with a piercing look

               she shudders galens eyes are still fastened on her shes 
               fighting to retain her hard manner but the agitation and 
               dread are plain

               oaks and willows they embrace and sink down into the deep 
               grass beside the water the leaves continue their unhurried

               of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming 
               up the slope they hurry down to meet it horsrik is in the 
               lead followed by soldiers and royal attendants elspeth 
               rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse bringing up 
               the rear is tyrian at last the cart can go no further 
               elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post 
               as the soldiers put the irons around her wrists horsrik 
               unrolls a parchment turns his back on the wind and begins 
               to read

                                     horsrik
                         now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom that the princess having 
                         been chosen by a deed of fortune and 
                         destiny 

               horsrik blinks theres a black stain growing in the middle 
               of the parchment all at once it bursts into flames he cries 
               out and flings the document away there follows a flash of 
               light and a puff of smoke and galen is standing there as if 
               he had materialized out of thin air horsrik and his startled 
               men backpedal down the slope

                                     horsrik
                         no fire i beg you

               galen raises his hands in a menacing gesture

                                     galen
                         be gone!

               thats enough for horsrik and company he and the soldiers 
               depart

                                     horsrik
                              over his shoulder
                         i declare these proceedings duly 
                         ordained

               only one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer 
               tyrian he draws his sword

                                     tyrian
                         i knew id find you here well im 
                         not as sentimental as some the 
                         kingdom every one of us need this 
                         sacrifice if you intend to interfere 
                         youll have to kill me

                                     galen
                         ive got plenty of reasons to kill 
                         you that have nothing to do with 
                         this sacrifice

               galen draws his own sword as it emerges into the night air 
               it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence

                                     tyrian
                         most impressive can you use it

               elspeth twists around in her chains

                                     elspeth
                         let it be! please! tyrian is right  
                         its our only hope!

               galen starts to reply but as soon as his attention wavers 
               tyrian is lunging toward him sword point directed at his 
               neck galen barely manages to parry the thrust before tyrian 
               is at him again blade swinging toward his knees galen drops 
               the tip of his sword to catch the blow when the two steel 
               edges connect sparks fly in a series of thrusts and counter
               thrusts each accompanied by a shower of sparks tyrian backs 
               galen up the mountain

                                     elspeth
                         tyrian  both of you  run! flee! 
                         its coming!

               sure enough at that moment the earth gives out a low moan 
               and undulates in a sickening movement vapors begin rising 
               from the lair

                                     tyrian
                         in a trice! this is no swordsman

               he might be right for galen turns and bolts across the slope 
               when he reaches the post with tyrian two steps behind he 
               whirls and brings his blade down on princess elspeths chains 
               the chains part in an explosion of sparks

                                     galen
                         run! get out of here!

               the princess darts from the piling as tyrian swoops down to 
               continue the attack galen dodges and the stake catches 
               tyrians blow the earth shakes again galen glances at the 
               princess

                                     galen
                         no! stop! what are you doing

               elspeth is not running away down the mountain instead she 
               is walking slowly and deliberately right into the smoking 
               cave swoosh! tyrians sword comes down again the dismayed 
               sorcerer ducks back and tyrians blade again bites deep into 
               the wood

                                     tyrian
                         youve failed my friend and i thank 
                         the gods for it come out from behind 
                         that post

               its now or never elspeth is no longer in sight galen grits 
               his teeth grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as 
               hard as he can in a wide arc the blade never even slows 
               down as it sails right through the post lopping it clean 
               off the glowing sword flashes above galens head and eagerly 
               buries itself in tyrians chest the kings man is as startled 
               by the amputated piling as he is by his own death his eyes 
               roll up in his head his knees buckle and he topples backward  
               the blade sliding free

               dragons lair

               smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as galen enters holding 
               his sword before him lighting his way with its faint blue 
               glow

                                     galen
                         elspeth!

               the floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is 
               paved first with rock then with dragon scales then with 
               bones with each footfall clusters of mysterious insects 
               scuttle away galen pauses to mop his brow its getting 
               hot a sound echoes up from the depths a grinding sound 
               like the gnashing of teeth followed by hissing and squealing 
               galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on suddenly he 
               stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper elspeths the 
               grinding sounds are louder he hurries forward and rounds a 
               corner he stops and gags

               basilisks

               two disgusting little reptiles  like scaly raccoons  are 
               perched on the corpse of princess elspeth ulfilas feeding 
               contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh galen groans 
               he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters

               the other one buzzes its halfformed winglets and hisses a 
               hot stream of air galen brings down the sword and slices it 
               in half eyes riveted on elspeths remains he edges around 
               the carnage and backs away hissss!  theres a third one 
               lurking in the shadows munching on something it might be a 
               hand galen shrieks and jumps away the little creature comes 
               at him and clamps its jaws on his leg galen stabs at it 
               repeatedly finally it lets go and flails and flops across 
               the bloody floor ululating its death agony as the creatures 
               last mewlings echo down through the cavern the ground 
               quivers bits of stone fall from the ceiling

               lake of fire

               galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are 
               alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water as before 
               he holds the sword in front of him he marvels at its 
               increasing brightness the heat is increasing too sweat 
               mats his hair and runs down his face a few yards further on 
               the sword starts pulsating now the walls take on a flickering 
               rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista 
               of staggering immensity an underground lake its surface 
               bubbling and torn with sheets of flame arching over it is a 
               vault of stone penetrated here and there by natural chimneys 
               the dimensions of this internal world are unknown  the 
               fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers the 
               one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones 
               leading across the hot liquid galen grips his sword and 
               resolutely hops from rock to rock

               vermithrax

               hes halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping 
               stones teeter beneath his feet a fiery wave washes over his 
               legs leaving his boots smoking another tremor knocks galen 
               to his knees as he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield 
               the great head of vermithrax rises up out of the depths on 
               its long neck it gazes at him through huge pale eyes under 
               armored lids a tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless 
               mouth the head sways from side to side the mouth hinges 
               open the nostrillike igniters come on and touch off the 
               jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards a roaring tube of 
               flame engulfs galen he crouches behind his dragon scale 
               shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life 
               the dragon pauses to take a breath galen springs to his 
               feet and bounds back the way he came his skin and clothing 
               singed flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with 
               a second burst

               tunnel

               coughing and weeping galen staggers up through the tunnel 
               nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons a 
               few seconds later vermithrax follows squirming and clawing 
               its way upward when it reaches its dead offspring it surveys 
               the scene with expressionless eyes bringing its head low 
               it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones

               ambush

               at that moment galen leaps out from behind a niche in the 
               tunnel wall and lunges forward striking sparks the point 
               of his sword slides across the dragons plated cheek and 
               stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck there is an 
               unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and 
               upward galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half 
               a sword the rest is buried in the beasts neck and 
               vermithrax doesnt like it it flings its head this way and 
               that knocking rocks loose from the ceiling its movements 
               cause the ground to quake as boulders tumble around him 
               galen drops to the floor under his shield dragon flame 
               reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him

                                                                    cut to

               fire shield half the scales are gone the rest are charred 
               and curling grimly she moves on a few paces away she picks 
               up the blunted sword she scans the rocks and finally sees 
               what shes looking for

                              he looks at her with

               this is small consolation and galen sighs

                                     galen
                         but the big ones alive somewhere 
                         down in that burning lake

                                     valerian
                         dont think about it you had your 
                         fight and youre still here thats 
                         more than anyone else can say lets 
                         think about what lies ahead

               she reaches out to take his hand but galen is no longer at 
               her side she stops and looks back

               galen

               galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path hes 
               staring into the middle distance with a sudden inspiration 
               bubbling in his brain he flings off his sack drops to his 
               knees and tears through the contents valerian comes back 
               baffled galens gear is strewn all over the trail

                                     valerian
                         what are you doing

               galen comes up with what hes looking for  the leather 
               sack when he replies it is not to her but to ulrich

                                     galen
                         you old trickster! the burning water! 
                         the lake of fire!

                                     valerian
                         galen what are you saying

               he regards her with astonishment

                                     galen
                         he had it planned he knew this was 
                         going to happen

                                     valerian
                         who did what happened

                                     galen
                         weve got to go back i want to talk 
                         to him!

               he heads back down the trail leaving his belongings on the 
               road

                                     valerian
                         where are you going

               she hurries after him

                                                                    cut to

               grange hall  day

               greil aka gregorious stands in the center of the burned
               out granary delivering a sermon behind him men are filling 
               the baptismal cistern

                                     greil
                         the church is mother to us all not 
                         just one lonely orphan who has lost 
                         his way not just a few but all of 
                         us that believeth in him when enough 
                         voices come together in prayer he 
                         shall hear we shall live and the 
                         beast shall die

               in the gathering simon ponders the hilt of his once fabulous 
               sword with its blade shortened it looks a lot like a 
               crucifix

                                                                    cut to

               dragon country  day

               galen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage 
               trailed by a desperate valerian

                                     valerian
                         galen stop! please i beg you!

               but galen pays no attention in a burst of speed and fury 
               valerian comes up behind and tackles him

                                     valerian
                         stop! i wont let you kill yourself

               galen waves the leather pouch in valerians face

                                     galen
                         he couldnt walk  he knew he 
                         couldnt make the journey so he had 
                         us make the journey for him! dont 
                         you see

               he jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair

                                     valerian
                              pursuing
                         no!

               she tackles him again

                                     valerian
                         all right all right youre going 
                         in there im going too

                                     galen
                              brought up short
                         what why no youre not this is my 
                         job absolutely not

               but valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair

                                     valerian
                         im not afraid and youre not going 
                         to stop me after all  ive been a 
                         man longer than you have

               galen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near 
               the remains of the wooden stake then charges after her

               underground

               running footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and galen 
               comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the 
               way valerian stumbles after him he grabs her hand

                                     galen
                         stay close

               down and down they go soon they reach elspeths body

                                     valerian
                         whats that

                                     galen
                         never mind come on

               but she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see

                                     galen
                         all right wait here

               he darts off in the flickering torchlight valerian can see 
               the princess remains all too clearly she suppresses a 
               scream

                                     valerian
                         galen galen where are you

               no answer the torch reveals several passages she doesnt 
               know which one to take

               lake of fire

               the passage widens out and once again galen is standing on 
               the shores of the lake of fire he looks around the water 
               is rolling with bubbles of gas and flames run hither and 
               yon across the surface but there is no sign of the dragon 
               gathering his courage he hops across the stepping stones to 
               the middle of the lake there he hurriedly opens the pouch

                                     galen
                         ex favilla vita nova!

               gripping the amulet with his free hand he scatters ulrichs 
               ashes in a wide arc over the burning water instantly there 
               is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug but no 
               wizard appears no dragon either there follows another and 
               stronger quake galen crouches to keep his balance still no 
               wizard

               outside

               thoroughly bewildered valerian stumbles out into daylight 
               she wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against 
               the stake something is strange its getting dark squinting 
               up at the sun she frowns in puzzlement then gapes at what 
               is happening

               eclipse

               slowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides 
               over the face of the sun plunging the world into crepuscular 
               halflight

                                                                    cut to

               grange hall  day

               the congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden 
               darkness

                                     greil
                         be calm he watcheth over us! and 
                         this is his sign! let us pray! our 
                         father who art in heaven

               the faithful bow their heads and join in simon as well

                                                                    cut to

               lake of fire

               the earthquakes have subsided the water is calm galen stares 
               bleakly into the flames as he watches they gather themselves 
               into a lazy spiral gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes 
               a vortex now the flames become tinged with green and as 
               the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air a form takes 
               shape at the crest of a jet of flame it is ulrich supine 
               as upon his pyre reforming before galens eyes

                                     galen
                         ulrich! magister! over here! i can 
                         see you! over here!

                                     ulrich
                              looks at him
                         not so loud im not deaf you know

               he slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides 
               through the flames

                                     ulrich
                         sic redit magus ex terra mortis

               the apprentice throws himself at his masters feet

                                     galen
                         wonder of wonders  youre back! i 
                         thank the powers that made me!

                                     ulrich
                         glad to see you too you didnt 
                         bring along anything to eat by any 
                         chance

                                     galen
                         food

                                     ulrich
                         no oh well no time anyway

               outside

               valerian is standing in the unearthly twilight anxiously 
               peering into the mouth of the lair suddenly she is hit from 
               behind by a gust of wind she does not turn to see the 
               enormous vermithrax alighting silently behind her

               galen & ulrich

               ulrich raises galen to his feet

                                     ulrich
                         come along theres much to be done

                                     galen
                         wait i have something to tell you

                                     ulrich
                         it can wait

                                     galen
                         no it cant listen i thought i was 
                         a sorcerer  but i wasnt i thought 
                         i had power  but i didnt i thought 
                         i was you  but im not

               he hangs his head ulrich regards him steadily

                                     ulrich
                         well said now hurry

               he leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the 
               tunnel

               valerian

               time seems to have come to a stop overhead the moon is 
               locked in front of the sun at the lair valerian stands 
               frozen as the dragon leans over her the great head sways 
               from side to side the jaws hinge open suddenly valerian 
               recovers herself and makes a run for it leaping and 
               scrabbling over the rocks a plume of flame licks at her 
               heels she sees a protective crevice and heads for it but a 
               winged claw drops to block her way she changes direction 
               and is cut off again cat and mouse

               vermithrax

               the pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless 
               victim the igniter jets come on then off as the beast 
               suddenly stiffens the head rotates almost as if catching a 
               new scent finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the 
               cavern

               ulrich

               there is the sorcerer leaning on galen coolly regarding 
               the creature the old mans expression hardens

                                     ulrich
                         draco draconis

               the dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them then flaps 
               twice and is airborne the thing shoots overhead and with a 
               rush of wind flies off into the gloom

               in the rocks

               valerian struggles out of her hiding place

                                     valerian
                         galen!

               galen runs to her they embrace when they look up ulrich 
               is at their side

                                     ulrich
                         wheres my amulet give it to me 
                         please

               galens hand locates the jewel under his shirt he finds 
               himself reluctant to part with it

               with a hurricane howl a column of flame touches down nearby 
               and rushes toward them they stagger back as the dragon sweeps 
               past

                                     ulrich
                         be quick!

               galen hands his treasure over ulrich closes his hand around 
               it

                                     ulrich
                         come close to me

               galen and valerian approach the old mans hand is suffused 
               with an internal glow behind them the dragon is turning 
               for another pass

               vortex

               all at once the glow brightens and in another instant the 
               world spins off into a blur setting all three afloat in a 
               timeless netherworld valerian and galen cling to each other 
               in terror

                                     ulrich
                         dont be afraid you have served me 
                         with great courage now you must 
                         show me you have even more

                                     galen
                         anything!

               the voices seem to be coming from a huge distance starlike 
               gleams whiz by and fleeting glimpses of halfrecognizable 
               faces and forms the wizards eyes are like glittering 
               crystals tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of 
               his beard he seems wreathed in luminescence

                                     ulrich
                         you must destroy the amulet and me 
                         along with it

                                     galen

                                     ulrich

                         must send me back

                                     galen

                         when the time comes youll 
                         understand here

               he dangles the amulet in front of galen even more reluctantly 
               than he let it go he takes it back

               mountain top

               abruptly the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a 
               rocky crag overlooking the eclipsedarkened fields and farms 
               of urland galen glances at his surroundings and stares at 
               the amulet full of awe

                                     ulrich
                         i know what youre thinking you 
                         have learned much and done well

                         more

                                                                    cut to

               grange hall  day

               greil is urging simon the last of the converts into the 
               cistern

                                     greil
                         make haste brother

               he dips simons head under water

                                     greil
                         now be thou baptized in the name of 
                         the father son and holy ghost may 
                         the lord our god light our way

               in the background half the congregation is staring through 
               the burnedout walls fervently praying and crossing 
               themselves wondering if theyll ever see the sun again a 
               cry goes up a shape crosses the solar corona wheels over 
               the village and streaks away toward the mountains  the 
               dragon

                                                                    cut to

               mountain top

               galen and valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch 
               ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff the 
               old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back

                                     ulrich
                         nimbus! tempestas! fulmen!

               from over the horizon roiling inkyblack clouds churn down 
               upon them thunder booms and echoes a bitter wind whips 
               their clothing as the storm gathers fury the dragon 
               reappears circling in the distance finally it homes in on 
               the mountain crag and dives at ulrich the conjurer makes a 
               gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beasts 
               scaly flanks it emits a high thin scream and rockets past

               galen & valerian

               valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of 
               granite

                                     valerian
                         here do as he said smash it

                                     galen
                         not if it means killing him

               ulrich

               he resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds 
               and starts another pass again the sorcerer summons lightning 
               bolts but the dragon keeps coming this time a talon splits 
               the old mans cape

               galen & valerian

               valerian wrestles the amulet away from galen it falls to 
               the ground

                                     valerian
                         you heard what he said

               she lifts the chunk of stone galen grabs for it

                                     galen
                         no! you cant!

               the last attack

               vermithrax spirals up into the storm then drops earthward 
               ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him he folds 
               his arms and bows his head leathery wings humming the 
               creature levels out swoops up past the crag and lifts the 
               master magician away in its huge hind claw

                                     ulrich
                         galen!

               galen and valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling 
               upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip as 
               the monstrous thing flies high over them they can hear 
               ulrichs faint screams

               death

               now galen understands he seizes the granite block from 
               valerian and raises it with both hands over his head he 
               takes a final look at the amulet glowing at his feet then 
               brings the rock down with all his might there is a blinding 
               flash as it shatters into a million fragments

               far above there is another blinding flash as ulrichs earthly 
               body explodes against the belly of the beast the darkened 
               sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the 
               dragons gut wings fluttering uselessly this reptilian 
               torch plummets to the ground

               lake

               below a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures trailing 
               a wake of flame vermithrax plunges like a comet into the 
               water there is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam

               galen & valerian

               they stare down from their lofty perch watching as further 
               explosions boil the water from the pond

               eclipse

               behind a tattered wrack of cloud the moon slowly uncovers a 
               pale sun

                                                                  dissolve

               the carcass  day

               grey misty light reveals the beasts mangled remains galen 
               and valerian emerge from the fog walk under a blackened 
               wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to 
               the huge charred head the death agony has twisted it upside 
               down the mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise 
               the eyes are glazed now the sound of voices floats toward 
               them chanting an ancient hymn a moment later a mob of 
               christians led by greil crests a hill and moves toward the 
               hulk the song ends

                                     greil
                         let us pray

               the members of the congregation fall to their knees

                                     greil
                         we thank thee lord for this divine 
                         deliverance verily is thy presence 
                         amongst us fully manifest in this 
                         thy great work

               galen and valerian look at each other she takes his hand

                                     greil
                         arise children of the lord and 
                         forsake evermore the pagan mysteries 
                         rejoice in the true power of the 
                         christian god!

               galen turns and leads valerian away they disappear into the 
               mist

                                                                  dissolve

               flensing  day

               in the clear light of a new day ladders have been tipped up 
               against the creatures back teams of men swarm over the 
               crusted flesh slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial 
               below yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges in 
               the background other workmen dump the remains into an open 
               pit

               the king

               with the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves the royal 
               coach pulls up to the shore of the lake a door creaks open 
               and king casiodorus totters out his face is puffy his eyes 
               are red he slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon 
               and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword horsrik 
               steps out of the coach and draws himself up

                                     horsrik
                              loud
                         all hail casiodorus rex  dragon 
                         slayer!

               the workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement 
               and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle wordlessly they 
               resume their labors

                                     horsrik
                              nodding
                         hail and praise be!

                                                                  dissolve

               on the road  day

               the trail leads through copses and open meadows side by 
               side galen and valerian march up a long slope under a hot 
               sun he limps a bit she finds a staff and hands it to him

                                     valerian

                                     valerian

                                     valerian
                         and the amulet

                                     galen
                         that too

                                     valerian

                         but i love you anyway i dont regret 
                         anything that happened i just wish 

                                     galen
                         yes

                                     valerian
                              sighs
                          that we had a horse

               galen falls a step behind he briefly closes his eyes and 
               mutters something they walk on a few paces then there is a 
               whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters 
               forth it crosses a meadow comes right up to valerian and 
               nuzzles her

                                     valerian
                         what is this

                                     galen
                         a horse

                                     valerian
                         did you!

                                     galen
                         no it must have been wandering loose 
                         or wild

               galen climbs aboard he reaches out to help her up

                                     valerian
                         wait a minute i just wished for a 
                         horse and here it is

                         you

               she thinks for a moment then lets him help her up galen 
               touches the horses flanks with his heels and they ride off

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
