          the crew chief stops by jake long enough to bark 
          
                              crew chief
                    exopack on lets go!
          
          beneath the shuttle air blasts outward for a hundred meter
          radius as it settles onto its landing gear
          
          inside everybody is queued up in the aisles with duffles
          ready rows of tense expectant faces in breathing masks 
          and we dip down to find jake wheelchair putting him at the
          level of everyone elses waists
          
                                                                        8
          
          
          
          the cargo ramp opens with a hydraulic whine
          
                              crew chief
                    go directly into the base! do not stop!
                    go straight inside!
          
          handheld running with the arriving colonists who double
          time down the ramp they jog across the exposed apron toward
          a walkway covered in chainlink which leads to the complex
          
          inside the chainlink tunnel are a couple of secops
          troopers corporal lyle wainfleet and private fike secops

          jake pumping his chair looks around as 
          
          a huge tractor taller than a house roars past on muddy
          wheels he notices something sticking in the tires 
          arrows the neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the

          light up the twilight a shadowy shape shrieks and drops off
          the fence it is an armed camp in a state of siege
          
          wainfleet and fike give jake and his chair the hairy eyeball
          as he approaches

          kkrash! smashes against the chainlink right next to his
          head
          
          a vicious aerial predator a meter across gnashes glass fangs
          against the steel it stabs at him through the chain link
          with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto a stingbat

          jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien
          
          on a walkway of the ops center seen from above a uniformed
          figure grips the railing watching jake pump his chair
          through the tunnel below
          
          the hair is clipped short the scalp is etched by long
          parallel scars where some pandoran denizens claws raked
          across it the bare arms below tightly rolled sleeves seem
          hewn out of some hard tropical wood crisscrossed by scars
          
          the man raises his masked face to look at the sky    he eyes
          are an icy steel gray
          
          his pov  the mighty polyphemus seems to fill the sky
          beyond the clouds

          administrator parker selfridge takes a ball from a newly
          opened case of titleists and sets it on the floor selfridge
          is young charismatic focused some would say ruthless
          
          he assumes the stance and lines up his putt toward a
          practice cup across the control room floor he glances up as
          grace strides toward him
          
                              grace
                    parker i used to think it was benign
                    neglect but now i see youre
                    intentionally screwing us

                    jarhead dropout
          
          selfridge looks down and hits the ball
          
          grace kicks the practice cup aside and the ball rolls past
          selfridge looks at her with a sigh
          
                              selfridge
                    actually we got lucky with him

          as selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball 
          
                                                                    16

                              selfridge
                    look youre supposed to be winning the
                    hearts and minds of the natives isnt
                    that the whole point of your little
                    puppet show if you look like them if
                    you talk like them theyll trust you
          
          selfridge crosses to his office behind a glass wall nearby
          grace follows
          
                              selfridge
                    but after  how many years  relations
                    with the indigenous are only getting
                    worse
          
                              grace
                    that tends to happen when you use machine
                    guns on them
          
          on selfridges desk is a magnetic base and hovering in mid
          air in the invisible field is a lump of metallic rock
          pure unobtanium he grabs it and holds it up between thumb
          and forefinger in front of graces eyes
          
                               selfridge
                    this is why were here unobtanium
                    because this little gray rock sells for
                    twenty million a kilo no other reason
                    this is what pays for the party and
                    its what pays for your science
                    comprendo

          feathers hanging across the trail like an orbweavers web

          bay passing rows of ampsuits standing in service racks
          techs clamber over the suits loading ordinance with cranes
          and lifts

          quaritch climbs the suit and reaches into the cockpit
          throwing some switches the suits gasturbine spools up
          with a rising whine
          
                                                                       25

          the whine is now a roaring whoosh as the suit trembles with
          power the air boils above the exhaust vents
          
          quaritch reaches in and operates the controls flexing one
          huge hand he nods to the waiting mechanic

          jake nods quaritch brings the suit to life he steps
          forward and pivots smoothly
          
          he balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping

          glistening jaws smash and snap against the barrier trunks
          sending chunks of wood flying its spittle sprays across
          jake jaws inches away as 
          
          he rolls onto his back and fires his ar point blank but the
          rifle is snatched out of his hands the beast screeches an
          ungodly wail of pain and rage and  rips the entire trunk
          away jake scrambles to escape but 
          
          glistening jaws lunge downward snap shut and 
          
          the creature rips jake out of the tree shaking him like a
          junkyard dog with a rabbit only 
          
                                                                       34
          
          
          
          it has him by the backpack so jake unlatches it and 
          
          he flies free as the thanator crushes the pack with its
          teeth giving jake a moment to sprint away but 
          
          with a hideous bellow the thanator crashes after him
          splintering trees
          
          jake runs in a blur dodging between trunks as a glistening
          black tornado shreds the forest behind him and 
          
          he sees water ahead and dives outward with all his might 
          
          the thanators jaws snap shut inches behind him as he flies
          out into open space and 
          
          jake splashes down into a swiftly moving river
          
          the thanator leaps down after him pursuing from rock to
          rock its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon
          
          jake ducks under as  fwhoosh!  black claws slash past
          his face amid turbulent bubbles
          
          a waterfall ahead jake is swept over the falls with the
          thanator swiping at him from a rock just missing and 
          
          jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract
          
          ext river below falls  day
          
          the water boils below the cataract jakes head bursts
          through the surface and he gasps for breath
          
          he is carried along by the current but manages to grab a
          limb on a fallen tree he weakly pulls himself up and just
          lies there gasping on the trunk
          
          above him on the cliff the thanator bellows a roar which
          echoes across the jungle
                                                                  cut to

          jake wet and bruised crouches under a screen of giant
          leaves   he hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with
          his knife forming a crude but sharp tip
          
          ext rainforest  day
          
          tracking with jake as he walks through the forest like its a
          minefield carrying his spear whiteknuckled he is freaked
          and hyperalert
          
                                                                        35
          
          
          
          the trees here are a hundred meters high blocking out the
          sky a few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the
          cyan gloom
          
          pov from above  looking down through leaves we watch jake
          move warily through the forest
          
          ecu  two golden eyes bright in the shadows
          
          downangle as jake passes under a tree limb invisible to
          him draped on the limb like a leopard is a striking navi
          girl she watches only her eyes moving
          
          she is lithe as a cat with a long neck muscular shoulders
          and nubile breasts and she is devastatingly beautiful 
          for a girl with a tail in human age she would be 18 her
          name is neytirinayteeree
          
          jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her oblivious
          
          neytiri rises soundlessly in one fluid sinuous movement
          she nocks an arrow to her bow and draws aiming right at
          jake utterly silent
          
          below her jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
          throat
          
          on neytiri as she follows him with the bow muscles tensing
          for the shot 
          
           and something drifts down in front of her fg    she
          hesitates
          
          rack focus to the tip of the arrow  where a single
          woodsprite floats down to land on the arrowheadlike a
          dandelion seed but larger the woodsprite waves its silky
          cilia feather light as it balances on the deadly point it
          glows faintly in the dark shadows
          
          neytiri frowns puzzled and lowers her bow slowly   the
          woodsprite whirls away into the gloom
                                                                      cut to

          grace stares into the dark forest as the samson banks hard
          thundering away toward the setting sun
                                                                  cut to

          black trees
          
          jakes got a new problem he sees shapes moving with liquid
          grace in the night shadows behind him he is being stalked by
          a pack of viperwolves
          
          jake catches only glimpses  a glint of eyes a slinking
          black movement  then nothing darkness
          
          time cut  tight on jakes hands as he knots his tshirt
          around the butt end of the spear
          
          angle on thick sap trickling down a treetrunk jake jams
          the makeshift torch into the sap soaking the shirt with it
          
          a waterproof match from his survival kit lights the torch
          
          the torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing
          leaping shadows jake turns warily as he moves along the
          trail
          
          behind him are several pairs of reflective green eyes
          another pair flanking him beside the trail blackonblack
          shapes which seem to flow like liquid
          
          he looks up  sees one cross a limb overhead   another on
          his opposite flank
          
          then a hideous sound like a hyenas psychotic laugh
          
          the viperwolves can run like a dog and climb like a monkey
          they are hunting jake from the ground and the trees
          
                                                                       37
          
          
          
          jake runs by torchlight on the edge of panic he reaches a
          steep banked stream and  without thinking  runs across it
          on a horizontal trunk 
          
           and stops dead on the other side the torch illuminates
          green eyes cutting ahead of him across the trail the
          viperwolves have him encircled
          
          the psychotic barks become more intense as they signal each
          other getting excited one makes a run at him angling on
          his legs from behind but 
          
          jake whirls jamming the torch in its face   it yips and goes
          past but another moves in 
          
          he jabs it with the business end of the spear and it snarls
          retreating baring its fangs
          
          now half a dozen are circling him in the open and he sees
          what hes up against   the viperwolves are sixlimbed with
          shiny chitinous skin their paws leathery black hands
          intelligent eyes glistening black teeth in dead white gums
          
          jake realizes that he is making his final stand   he whirls
          the torch in an arc keeping them at bay 
          
          and feels a rush of adrenaline it goes through him like a
          lightning bolt and the fear is gone
          
                              jake
                        screaming
                    i dont have all goddamn night! come on!
                    come on!
          
          with snarls and a blur of motion they attack
          
          jake cracks the spear down on one then spins as 
          
          another leaps at him and he plants the spear in it striking
          true but 
          
          its momentum wrenches it from his hands and the torch goes
          flying left in semidarkness jake draws his knife as
          
          a wolf lunges sinking its teeth into his arm he yells in
          pain and fury slashing with the knife which 
          
          cuts deep into the beasts shoulder and it lets go
          
          jake sprints trying to escape but a snarling viperwolf
          leaps grabbing him by the ankle with its forehand jake
          tears away sprawling scrambling to get up as 
          
                                                                       38
          
          
          
          three wolves charge at once     the nearest leaps at his throat
          just as 
          
          thunk!!  an arrow appears in its chest
          
          the wolf lands on him already a dead weight    he pushes it
          off in time to see 
          
          a blue amazon emerge from the trees nock another arrow draw
          and fire in one fluid motion an unearthly yowl as another
          wolf falls
          
          neytiri leaps right over jake and cracks her bow down on the
          skull of a circling wolf
          
          another springs at her and she drops under its weight but
          rolls coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand
          
          her knife flashes down buried to the hilt in its chest
          
          snarling a wounded wolf attacks jake and he kicks it away
          but 
          
          it spins and leaps back onto him and jake barely catches its
          throat in time to keep the snapping jaws away from his face
          
          meanwhile neytiri swings her bow in a big arc cracking it
          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves
          
                              neytiri
                    rrreeyaaah! hyaaaah!!
          
          the wolves slink and circle yelping as the bow whistles past
          them finally they break and run with neytiri chasing and
          
          they bound away through the foliage as she shouts after them
          
                                 neytiri
                    raaaarrrr!
          
          jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
          weight finally it stops thrashing panting he releases it
          and looks up at 
          
          neytiri her tail lashes as she scans the forest listening
          to the fading yelps of the wolves satisfied the attack is
          over she turns
          
          she regards him coldly for a second then walks past him
          neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream
          
                              jake
                    wait dont 
          
                                                                       39
          
          
          
          jake blinks around at the darkness  realizing he can still
          see in fact with the blinding torchlight gone the forest
          is transformed
          
          the jungle has come alive with bioluminescence  spots and
          patterns ghosts and galaxies of bluegreen light
          
          jake scrambles to recover his spear   neytiri kneels beside 
          
          a dying wolf its cries are pitiful it paws the air
          trying to raise its head she pulls her knife from its
          chest
          
                              neytiri
                        in navi
                    forgive me my brother
          
          she cuts its throat ending the pitiful cries she touches
          its head gently regarding it with sadness
          
          neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
          waist she crosses to another slain wolf and kneels pulling
          the arrow from its heart
          
                              jake
                    look um i know you probably dont
                    understand this but  thanks thank
                    you i owe you
          
          neytiri ignores him assuming a prayer posture over the dead
          animal
          
                              neytiri
                        in navi
                    forgive me may your spirit run with the
                    great mother

                    i would have been screwed if you hadnt
                    come along 
          
          she rises and walks away without looking at jake
          
                              jake
                    hey wait wait!   where you goin
          
          he crashes through some plants catching up to her
          
                              jake
                    slow down a second will you i just want
                    to thank you for killing those 
          
          he makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and 
          
                                                                     40
          
          
          
          whack! she wallops him upside the head with her bow in a
          fierce backhand swing laying him out flat
          
          he looks up to see a fury standing over him a fury who
          speaks english  accented halting angry english
          
                              neytiri
                    dont thank! you dont thank for this!
                    this is sad very sad only

          she gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves
          
                              neytiri
                    all this is your fault! they did not need

          she silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat
          
                              neytiri
                    your fault! you are like a baby making

                              jake
                    okay fine you love your little forest

          meet his for the first time  a riveting gaze with those big
          gold orbs

                                                                       41

          she turns away stalking off but jake goes after her
          
          tracking with neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge root
          
          wider as she trots with perfect balance along the root which
          forms an elevated walkway
          
          jake runs to catch up realizing suddenly that he is far
          above the forest floor throughout the following they move
          through a glowing phantasmagorical forest
          
                              jake

          she leaps to another elevated root   jake follows surprised
          that he made it
          
                               jake

                    no one can teach you to see

          moves one hand slowly not wanting to break the spell he
          studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until

          he touches leaves as he passes watching the bioluminescence
          shiver through them
          
          jake looks down as  they cross a bed of purple moss which
          reacts to the pressure of their footsteps rings of green
          light like ripples on a pond expand outward from each
          footfall exploding rings of light where his feet touch
          down dreamlike surreal beauty
          
          wide on them as they run over a large root across a mirror
          like pool at the base of a waterfall
          
          jake follows neytiri running along a raised roottrunk

          jake hears whooshwhoosh and snaps a look as a bolo flies at
          him spinning end for end and 
          
          shwhap!!  tangles around his legs   he topples off the root
          and crashes into the foliage below
          
          jake untangles himself getting up to run just as 
          
          several navi riders thunder toward him they are riding
          direhorses  sixlegged armorskinned alien clydesdales

          we see that the riders queues are connected to the horses
          long mothlike antennae  a neurallink with which they can
          command the horse leaving hands free for weapons
          
          the riders aim bows and spears at jake as they approach jake
          turns to bolt but 
          
          navi hunters melt out of the shadows weapons aimed 
          blocking his retreat
          
          neytiri drops to the ground next to jake and confronts the
          lead rider she shouts sharply in navi

          tsutey draws his bow but neytiri leaps between him and jake
          confronting him warrior to warrior

          and bows he is shoved forward along the trail as tsutey
          and the others ride ahead

          mothers with babies old women young hunters
          
          they gawk at the alien expressions ranging from curiosity to
          outright hostility the huge eyes of the children follow
          him
          
          jake is amazed at the size of hometree inside by the light
          of the cookfires he can see up into a vast cylindrical
          gallery  a living cathedral
          
          clear membranes  sturmbeest bladders  filled with
          fluttering bioluminescent insects act as area lighting
          
          the central space is dominated by the skull of some enormous
          creature mounted with much embellishment on a totem
          standing in front of this awaiting their approach is

          the horse launches into a gallop jake flops around with no
          idea how to sit the animal and is promptly thrown off he
          lands painfully in the mud
          
          he gets up brushing mud off knees and ass as neytiri leads
          the horse back to him

          on jake face down in the mud of the riverbank he painfully
          rises to hands and knees which is when he sees 
          
          tsutey and another hunter thundering across the shallow
          river on their direhorses spray blasts up from their
          hooves

                                                                 cut to
          
          int/ext hometree  banshee eyrie
          
          looking down the central shaft of hometree 80 meters to the
          ground villagers are antlike
          
          jake tries to keep up with neytiri as she leaps up the core
          trunk like a lemur he climbs the last section arriving out
          of breath beside her she leads him outside onto 
          
          a large branch through gaps in the foliage jake can see
          other great trees scattered across the landscape like
          enormous umbrellas above the rainforest
          
          neytiri strides out across the branch toward some kind of
          structure  a web made of thick woven fiber dark shapes
          clinging to it stir with a leathery rustling sound
          
          neytiri makes a series of trills and clicks one of the
          shapes moves toward them emerging into a shaft of sunlight
          
          a huge mountain banshee much larger than the forest
          banshees this thing is taller than a navi with a 10 meter
          wingspan a leathery fwhoop like the crack of sails as it
          alights on the branch right in front of her
          
                                 jake
                    holy shit
          
                              neytiri
                    do not look in her eye
          
          neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat which it snatches and
          gulps down she murmurs to it and strokes its neck
          
          it lets out a signature shriek and some of the others in the
          shadows nearby answer
          
          neytiri flipcatches her queue and gently connects it to the
          banshees antenna it shivers and stretches its wings as the
          neural connection is made
          
                              neytiri
                    ikran is not horse once shahaylu is
                    made ikran will fly with only one hunter
                    in the whole life
          
          she climbs smoothly onto the animals back
          
                                                                       61
          
          
          
                              neytiri
                    to become taronyu  hunter  you must
                    choose your own ikran and he must choose
                    you
          
                                 jake
                    when
          
                              neytiri
                    when you are ready
          
          the banshee shivers with anticipation
          
                                 neytiri
                    heeyaaahh!
          
          jake ducks as the great wings explode open and the banshee
          drops off the branch it swoops down across the forest
          canopy banks hard lets out a cry and beats its wings in a
          power climb
          
          completing the bank neytiri directs the banshee into a close
          swooping flyby and jake instinctively ducks
          
          on neytiri  flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount
          the rainforest rolling beneath her
                                                                  cut to

          grace behind him looks up from her microscope scowling

                    the days are starting to blur together
                    the language is a bitch but i figure
                    its like fieldstripping a weapon
                    repetition
          
          this throws us into a teaching montage
          
          jake and neytiri kneel together inside hometree neytiri
          touches her lips with her fingertips
          
                                                                       62

                    ontu mikyun nari
          
          neytiri stands next to him correcting his position as he
          draws a longbow
          
          barking commands she smacks him on the shoulder then the
          elbow repositioning him roughly
          
                              jake vo
                    neytiri thinks im some kind of retard
          
          human jake emerges from the link to see 
          
          trudy and norm caught in the act on norms bunk norm blushes
          and trudy waves pulling the blanket over their heads
          
                              jake vo
                    norms attitude has improved lately
          
          norm works with jake at the small table in the shack kitchen
          
                                 norm
                    thank you

                    ireiyo
          
          norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation
          
                              norm
                    irrrreiyo irrrreiyo   youve gotta roll
                    the r rrroll it
          
          norm makes jake repeat the word getting more frustrated
          
                              jake vo
                    its good hes back on board but he
                    thinks im a retard too
          
          tracking with jakes feet as he runs over rocks leaping onto
          a thick root running on across the rough bark
          
                              jake vo
                    my feet are getting tougher   i can run
                    farther every day
          
                                                                       63
          
          
          
          neytiri leads him along a massive root and soon they are
          running 30 meters above the ground
          
          he sprints with her through the trees trying to keep up
          she climbs and leaps with the ease of a spider monkey
          
                              jake vo
                    i have to trust my body to know what to
                    do with neytiri its learn fast or die
          
          neytiri leaps off into space falling falling until 
          
          she catches an enormous palm leaf and gripping it allows
          its droop to slow her fall she lets go plummeting and
          catches another
          
          jake follows in a leap of faith the camera plunges with
          him from leaf to leaf down and down in a dizzying kinetic
          rush
          
          he drops down from the last leaf landing next to her on a
          game trail he is exhilarated to still be alive
          
          neytiri is surprised  that he followed   that he lived
          
          tight on human jake in the shack thinking as he looks at
          the pictures of grace with the laughing kids at the school
          
          in the commons  avatar norm formally greets moat the
          matriarch looks on as grace kneels to hug children she knows
          graces eyes sparkle as she chats with them in navi
          
                              jake vo
                    i sweettalked moat into giving norm and
                    grace a hall pass now grace even makes
                    me coffee before link every morning
          
          grace looks up to see neytiri approaching it is an awkward
          moment between them grace makes the formal gesture of
          greeting
          
                              grace
                        navi subtitled

                    i see you doctor grace augustine
          
          another day  neytiri kneels on a game trail pointing out
          the tracks in the mud to jake she touches the edges of the
          plants around her and sniffs the air
          
                                                                      64

                    scents and sounds
          
          jake and neytiri watch through a screen of leaves as 
          
          a herd of huge armored sturmbeest walks through the shallows
          of a lake in the middle of the herd the babies are
          sheltered from predators among their parents legs
          
          one of the bulls trumpets and a flock of tetrapterons takes
          flight an explosion of purple wings
          
          jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau
          
          another place  neytiri stands utterly still except for her
          ears which move with a life of their own her eyes are
          closed she speaks very softly to jake 
          
                              neytiri
                    when you hear nothing you will hear
                    everything when you see nothing you
                    will see everything

          jake and neytiri creep quietly stalking a large male
          hexapede  a six legged deerlike creature
          
          jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as neytiri
          watches he takes a bead on the hexapede  tracks it for a
          beat with the drawn bow then relaxes his arm zen archery
          
                              jake vo

          neytiri and jake crawl through the undergrowth   she points
          and he parts some leaves to see 
          
          a mother viperwolf bringing meat to her cubs which frisk
          around her legs she licks their faces

          neytiri and jake move through the night forest surrounded by
          galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence they move
          gracefully soundlessly  two forest spirits
          
          cu jake  the pupils of his cat eyes dilated the night
          forest floods his brain with its million biosources
          
          night shot from overhead  jake and neytiri bowfishing
          from a dugout canoe over huge glowing anemones at the bottom
          of a pool
          
          a large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow      zap!
          jake drills it he holds up the fish triumphantly
          
          another day  neytiri stands close behind jake adjusting
          his position as he draws his bow only now her hands are
          gentle as they move on his arms his shoulders
          
          aware of her touch jakes focus is broken   their eyes meet
          and she pulls away quickly
          
          night  they enter a clearing filled with chesthigh ferns
          neytiri signals him to move slowly they approach a creature
          on one of the ferns an ugly sticklike lizardthing
          perched on a frond as he approaches 
          
          snap! a long spine whips in a circle unfurling a
          bioluminescent membrane  a disk a meter across opening
          like a chinese fan it flies off a living frisbee
          
          the fan lizard floats across the clearing
          
                                                                        66
          
          
          
          neytiri plunges among the ferns with a sharp cry an
          explosion of color as dozens of fan lizards take flight
          
          grinning widely she hops around like a little girl until
          they are all flying and for the first time she is
          unguarded and joyful totally herself with him
          
          inside the link  jakes eyes open in the darkness he
          doesnt know where he is he weakly pushes open the lid
          blinking at the light

          tight on avatar jake silently drawing his bow his eyes
          focused in intense concentration a beat  the arrow flies
          
          jake pulls the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede
          he dispatches it with his knife
          
          he speaks haltingly but with feeling in navi

                    what did happen at the school
          
          grace looks up from making coffee   her eyes track across the
          pictures of the laughing children   finally 
          
                                                                     68

                    the clearcutting
          
          grace sips her coffee grimaces at the taste
          
                              grace
                    one day she and a couple of other young
                    hunters came running in all painted up 
                    theyd set a bulldozer on fire  i guess
                    they thought i could protect them
          
          graces voice stays oddly calm as he tells this terrible
          story while getting milk out of the refrigerator
          
                              grace
                    the troopers pursued them to the

                    they killed sylwanin in the doorway
                    right in front of neytiri then shot the
                    others

                    yeah
          
          jake realizes that grace is on the verge of tears and
          desperately trying to hide it
          
                              grace
                    a scientist stays objective  we can not
                    be ruled by emotion but i poured ten
                    years of my life into that school they
                    called me saatenuk mother
                        turning to him
                    that kind of pain reaches back through
                    the link
          
          grace sits down at the table looks intently at jake

          grace looks at him with real pain in her eyes

          ext mountain trail  day
          
          tsutey leads three direhorse riders up the trail  two
          teenage hunters and jake whos riding well enough to keep
          up the horses hooves clop right next to a sheer drop into a
          misty canyon
          
                              jake vo
                    iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
                    to heaven its the test every young
                    hunter has to pass
          
          tsutey signals a stop
          
          upslope ahead is an astounding formation thick vinelike
          trees have trapped large floating boulders of unobtanium in
          their gnarled grip
          
          a hundred meters above them more boulders are woven into the
          twisted vinetrunks this is some sort of freak natural
          occurrence  like the mythical beanstalk going up into the
          clouds
          
          there is a thundering roar like an artillery barrage and
          the ground shakes jake looks around at 
          
          one of the floating mountains grinding against the flank of a
          nearby mesa a huge rockfall is set loose the mountain is
          drifting toward them filling half the sky
          
          the hunters dismount
          
          jake looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds he
          turns to tsutey who is checking the young hunters gear
          
                              jake
                    we doin this
          
          jake leaps to catch up as tsutey and the hunters swarm up
          the base of the beanstalk
                                                                  cut to

          ext beanstalk  day
          
          200 meters up the beanstalk the hunters nimbly climb along
          the vinetrunks they clamber over one of the unobtanium
          boulders which is lifting this incredible tree
          
          jake looks down  the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
          a licorice stick a chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
          over it  it floats upward
          
          they reach the upper branches of the beanstalk above them
          the craggy underbelly of mons veritatis looms spray from
          one of the waterfalls hits them
          
          some of the hanging vines are brushing over the upper
          branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss
          
          one by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass
          
          jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine his feet dangling
          over nothingness they climb toward the floating islands
          above
          
          ext mons veritatis  day
          
          tiny figures cross a causeway of vines connecting a small
          island of unobtanium to the main mass of mons veritatis
          
          wide shot looking down a rock face bigger than half dome 
          the sheer side of mons veritatis
          
          banshees circle next to the cliffs flashing in shafts of
          sunlight waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below
          
          ext grotto/banshee rookery  day
          
          a waterfall thunders down into the void like a faucet of the
          gods jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below
           a view from olympus
          
          a shriek and the thwap thwap of leathery wings  neytiris
          banshee swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto she
          dismounts and like a falconer covers its eyes with a woven
          hood it waits docile as 
          
          she joins jake and the hunter party tsutey leads them
          through the cave until they emerge onto a cliff face and
          jake sees 
          
          the banshee rookery hundreds of banshees huddle on rock out
          croppings as far as the eye can see they cling to the walls
          with the foreclaws on their wings or perch on ledges
          
                                                                       71

                    jakesully will go first
          
          tsutey smirks at jake a challenge in his eyes the two
          teenage hunters are scared but trying to act tough
          
          tsutey scowls when neytiri leads jake out onto the ledge
          
                              neytiri
                        whispering
                    now you choose your ikran this you must
                    feel  inside if he also chooses you
                    move quick like i showed you will have
                    one chance

                    how will i know if he chooses me
          
                              neytiri
                    he will try to kill you
          
                              jake
                    outstanding
          
          out of sight of tsutey neytiri takes his hand and squeezes
          it jake feels a rush of emotion but she breaks away like
          it didnt happen he is on his own on the ledge with 
          
          the banshees they eye him as he approaches several shriek
          and take flight others flap their wings and yawn showing
          rows of fangs in a threat display
          
          jake unrolls a weighted leather strap like a oneended bolo
          
          a large male spreads enormous wings shrieks and glares
          straight at him
          
          jake looks directly into its eyes  and strides toward it
          
                              jake
                    lets dance
          
          the challenged banshee hisses and leaps at him jaws wide as
          
          jake times the lunge swinging the bolo feinting and then
          slipping aside as the banshees jaws miss him snapping shut
          
          jake whaps the bolo across its snout the weighted thong
          whips twice around its long jaws tying them shut a muffled
          scream and it slashes at his stomach with razor talons but 
          
                                                                      72
          
          
          
          jake is already leaping over the talons and tackling the
          banshee around the neck it topples on its side and he
          swarms it  arms around its thrashing head
          
          jake grabs its whiplike antenna and brings it toward his
          queue but 
          
          the bony head slams sideways and bam!  clocks him right in
          the face almost knocking him out and 
          
          it writhes flinging him to the ground he slides on the
          rock and almost goes over the edge as 
          
          neytiri gasps tsutey laughs and yells mockingly
          
          the bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head way
          pissed off now but 
          
          jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it claws rake his
          leg but he gets his arms around its head and clamps down
          hard they flop to the ground and he scrambles on top
          pinning it and 
          
          grabs its whipping antenna locks it under his arm and jams
          the end of his queue into it they fuse together and 
          
          the banshee stops struggling it lies there panting   they
          are locked together literally eye to eye
          
                              jake
                    thats right! youre mine
          
          ecu banshee  the pupil like a deep black well
          
          jake relaxes his grip and slowly warily slides his leg over
          the creatures back
          
          neytiri runs to him
          
                              neytiri
                    first flight seals the bond you cannot
                    wait
          
          jake sits astride the creature feeling its power   he grips
          a hank of the beasts main and 
          
                              jake
                    heeeyyyaaaah!
          
          thwap! thwap! the banshee is off like a shot jake screams
          as they plummet off the cliff  the banshee wails and 
          
                                                                      73
          
          
          
          they fall together spiralling out of control and he is
          almost tossed lose the thing is squawking and shrieking so
          much he cant think
          
                               jake

          it levels out jake cocks his head only thinking bank left
          and the animal complies he settles the banshee into an easy
          loping beat of its huge wings while he catches his breath
          
          neytiris banshee falls into formation with him   she signals
          follow me and dives
          
          jake guides his banshee clumsily after her neytiris
          banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips while
          jakes wobbles and dips almost falling out of the sky
          
          the camera swoops after them as neytiri leads an arcing dive
          around the flank of mons veritatis the scenery is stunning
          they pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines
          
          neytiri leads jake in a sharp bank skimming close to the
          cliffs they punch through streamers of cloud and emerge
          into sunlight
          
          jake is getting the hang of it he jinks left then right
          then dives tucking himself tight against the animals back
          hes reckless fearless half in control and loving it

          their mounts straight down past camera pulling out and

          rainbows of stone above a deep caldera in the center of the
          caldera is a single enormous willow tree gnarled and

          a huge shadow covers him and neytiri shouts a warning   jake
          looks up to see 
          
          a leonopteryx in a deltadive whistling straight at him

          scarlet yellow and black with a midnight blue crested head

          it banks away with a frustrated shriek two flaps of its
          mighty wings and it is gone back above the canopy

          direhorse at full gallop the sight is breathtaking he
          hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest crashes down
          flipping twice from momentum

          draws and fires his bow the arrow strikes true in the

          the beast crashes to the ground skids to a stop in a cloud
          of dust

          is passed around

          jake surrounded by young hunters acts out the leonopteryx
          attack with his hands the leaping firelight plays across
          the eye sockets of the toruk skull bringing it to life it

          offering it to him a challenge or an olive branch

          hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm

          the fence selfridge wearing an exopack tees up while grace
          and jake approach from the direction of the ops center
          
                              selfridge

          the ball drops into the mud just past a marker which reads
          220 a trooper walks over to retrieve it
          
                              selfridge
                    the low gravity and the high air density
                    cancel out so

                    not what i was hoping to hear
          
          it starts to rain selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from
          his golf bag and snaps it open
          
                              grace

          contracts his muscles but 
          
          in his vision jake stands serene on a floating mountain
          cliff a great black shadow covers him the unmistakable x
          silhouette of a diving leonopteryx the last shadow
          
          camera screams down on him as the shadow grows larger  we
          rush into his face into the blackness of his pupil which
          fills the universe and 
          
                                                                       87
          
          
          
          real jake writhes in the dirt his back arched as his muscles
          seize he foams and thrashes his eyes rolled back in his
          head while inside 
          
          time itself has accelerated  clouds scream around the
          mountain tops mist boils through the forest he feels the
          wind of time blowing through him as 
          
          real jake claws the ground moaning staring blindly while 
          
          inside in pov he flies over the landscape of pandora 
          
          but the forest is blasted fires flicker among trees that
          are burned black and lifeless in a smoky twilight
          
          a great winged shadow is cast below rippling over the
          devastated ground avatar jake looks down at the shadow
          realizes he is casting it and we rush in to his pupil and 
          
          pull back from the eye of a great leonopteryx flying lordly
          and terrible over the land it lets out an almighty shriek
          which seems to echo to eternity and 
          
          slam cut to jake on his back gasping  back in his body
          he weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room

          jake looks from eytukan to moat tsutey and the elders how
          can he tell them what he has seen
          
          moat puts her splayed fingers against his face seeming to
          peer into his troubled soul
          
                              moat
                        to jake

          she steps back and eytukan motions for jake to stand he
          gets up weakly

          others the entire clan is gathered waiting to hear what
          has happened jake looks up at the leonopteryx skull totem
          which seems to stare down at him
          
          grace watches her eyes brimming proud relieved amazed
          
          eytukan places both hands on jakes chest and holds them
          there

          all the members of the clan press forward crowding around
          and putting their hands on jakes shoulders back chest 
          hands upon hands until he is connected to everyone
                                                             dissolve to

          jake and neytiri run silhouetted in the night behind them
          waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light polyphemus
          rises behind the trees
          
          neytiri dives from a rock slicing into a mirror of water
          jake follows her and 
          
          underwater they swim over glowing anemones
          
          they seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
          of waving shapes tiny purple fish swirl around them
          
          their hands come together fingers twining as they float
          weightlessly as if between worlds
                                                             dissolve to

          laughing they run together into a stand of willows their
          trunks are as gnarled as bonsai long faintly glowing
          tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains
          
          underfoot a bed of moss glows faintly it reacts to their
          footsteps with expanding rings of light
          
          it is an exquisitely beautiful spot
          
          the willows stir responding to their presence she holds up
          her hands letting the tendrils caress her
          
                                                                       89

          fingers his palms his forearms his eyes go wide we hear
          the whispering of ancient navi voices

          a few woodsprites circle around them some alighting on their
          shoulders and arms
          
          they stand very close together now her eyes are intense
          almost luminous he feels drawn into them

                    also choose me
          
          she takes his hands and their fingers intertwine moving
          gently over each other
          
                                                                       90

          she pulls him down until they are kneeling facing each other
          on the faintly glowing moss
          
          neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it jake does
          the same with trembling anticipation the tendrils at the
          ends move with a life of their own straining to be joined
          
          macro shot  the tendrils intertwine with gentle
          undulations
          
          jake rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
          and hers the ultimate intimacy
          
          they come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
          moss and ripples of light spread out around them
          
          the willows sway without wind and the night is alive with
          pulsing energy as we dissolve to

                    alright look  i dont have the answers
                    yet im just now starting to even frame
                    the questions what we think we know 
                    is that theres some kind of
                    electrochemical communication between the
                    roots of the trees like the synapses
                    between neurons each tree has ten to the
                    fourth connections to the trees around
                    it and there are ten to the twelfth
                    trees on pandora

          eytukan scowls at jake then grabs tsutey and yells

          tsutey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of hometree
          
          in the cockpit quaritch grows impatient
          
                              quaritch

          on the dragons stubwings the 40mm rocket launchers open up
          with a barrage of leaping fire which flashes down and 
          
          kwhoom!kwhoom!kwhoom!  the inside of hometree erupts
          with multiple explosions of teargas
          
          the gas rolls across the confused villagers they begin to
          cough and gag
          
          eytukan and the remaining hunters bravely fire at the
          gunships with their longbows
          
          in the dragons cockpit quaritch laughs as arrows clink
          against the armored windows
          
          amid clouds of teargas the omaticaya run stumble collapse
          
                              eytukan

          the villagers pour out of hometree everyone is yelling
          piercing screams in the boiling gas
          
          jake eyes streaming struggles with his bindings
          
          kawhoom! an incendiary round explodes inside the commons
          flames roar through the base of hometree
          
                                                                     108
          
          
          
          inside hometree it is a burning smoky hell flames roar up
          the inside like a chimney stragglers scramble outside
          coughing and dragging wounded with them
          
          high up in the trunk tsutey and his hunters leap rapidly
          from spoke to spoke climbing barely ahead of the fireball
          
          outside the fire is driven by the rotorwash toward jake and
          grace who are still bound tightly to the posts
          
          out of the smoke moat appears in front of jake    she raises
          a knife and 
          
          slashes downward jake looks down surprised to see his
          bonds falling away he meets her eyes which are filled with
          horror but also something else call it faith
          
                              moat
                    you are one of us   help us!
          
          jake takes the knife and cuts grace free
          
                              jake
                    weve gotta move!    hes gonna blow the
                    columns
          
          as grace realizes what he means he grabs her and they run
          around them the omaticaya flee in horror and confusion
          
          in the cockpit quaritch watches as the omaticaya stream away
          from the great tree running along roots and branches

          she takes her finger off the firecontrol and pulls her
          aircraft out of formation
          
          pushing in on quaritch the hometree reflecting in his
          glasses
          
                                                                      109

                    bring it down
          
          missiles stream down from the dragon and the other gunships
          and 
          
          the base of hometree vanishes in a chain of highexplosive
          blasts the massive pillars fragment into matchsticks and 
          
          the omaticaya watch in horror as 
          
          hometree groans and starts to move
          
          in a cacophony of cracking splintering roots the mighty
          tree topples with agonizing slowness
          
          at the banshee eyrie tsutey and the other hunters spur
          their mounts into flight they swoop among the branches as
          the tree the one fixed thing in their lives moves
          
          it crashes down through the forest canopy crushing the
          lesser trees in its path falling ponderously
          
          hometree hits the ground like the end of the world raising a
          great cloud of dust and pulverized debris
          
          in the dragon cockpit quaritch surveys the destruction

          incendiaries launch from the gunships exploding into gouts
          of fire in the debris of hometree
          
          the gunships fan the flames through the trees like a fire
          storm the omaticaya retreat as a wall of fire advances
          
          jake searches for neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks

          the inferno she sees 
          
          eytukan a large shard of wood is driven through him like a
          spear he recognizes her as she kneels over him

          they watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below a
          great pall of smoke darkens the landscape

          at the desk outside the lone trooper looks up as 
          
          trudy approaches along the corridor pushing a stainless
          steel trolley
          
                              trudy

                    see that 
          
          the guard bends to look into the hot cart and   
          
          the muzzle of trudys pistol presses behind his ear
          
                                                                     112

          she whistles and max trots around the corner
          
          trudy binds the guard with one of his own zipties as max
          grabs his key card and runs to the cell swipes the card
          the door is rolling open when 
          
          another trooper rounds the corner trudy takes him down with
          a sharp blow to the windpipe and a thai knee to the ribs
          
          meanwhile the first trooper is getting up but max clocks him
          heartily with a coffee urn he goes down and stays down
          
                              max
                    that was unexpectedly satisfying

          tendrils of the mother tree
          
          neytiri and the other acolytes dance hypnotically all the
          omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums
          
          macro shot  fine hairlike threads have emerged from the
          roots and are gently spreading over graces human skin
          
          jake still holding her hand watches her body being fused to
          the rootfloor by a thousand connections
          
          graces avatar is gently connected by the same questing root
          cilia they entwine with the queue and spread over the body
          
          the grotto is dark except for the spectral glow of the
          willows the chant continues hypnotically moat on her
          knees beneath the mother tree writhes her arms in the trance
          state her eyes are rolled back showing only white
          
          grace gasps and her eyes snap open her expression is amazed
          as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be
          explained
          
          on her hand  gripping jakes convulsively as she tries to
          anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds

                     shes real 
          
          grace shudders as pain shoots through her blood seeps
          through the silken white rootcilia growing across her
          abdomen drowning white in shocking crimson
          
          she exhales a last shuddering breath  and goes still

                    grace!
          
          he sees the roots falling away from her human body
          
          jake turns hopefully toward her avatar  but the roots are
          falling away from it as well it sleeps  vacant
          
                                                                       122

          neytiri removes graces mask and gently closes her eyes
          
          jake stands slowly barely holding it together
          
          neytiri comes to him and he sees the despair and hope
          conflicting on her face 
          
           and he raises his head   turns to face tsutey and the
          crowd

          tsutey gestures assent and they face the clan together
          
          jake speaks the pain of graces death in the passion and
          fury of his voice tsutey translates beside him

          the scorpion gunner locks up neytiri for a missile shot but 
          
          a shadow crosses his canopy out of the sun comes a crimson
          demon shrieking over the roar of the turbines and 
          
          kwhammm!! the leonopteryx slams the gunship driving it
          downward in a dive the leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
          and teeth as they fall together out of control
          
          jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick
          breaking its back on a rocky promontory and exploding
          
          flying with a samson as a second samson falls in beside it
          this one has its pilot door off and the pilot is wearing a
          breathing mask the door gunners wave at 
          
          trudy her expression grim behind her mask she holds the
          cyclic stick between her knees while she rakes the other ship
          with bursts from an ar in her lap
          
          the pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control
          
                              trudy
                    youre not the only ones with guns you
                    pricks
          
          neytiri jinks her banshee hard an enemy samson right behind
          her the pilot is a hotdog following her down into the
          trees under the canopy
          
          they slalom among the trunks at high speed the gunners hang
          half out the doors firing bark and leaves explode around
          neytiri as she zigzags through the jungle
          
          the banshee dives under a huge tree limb and the pilot
          follows he looks up at the last second catching a glimpse
          of blueskinned figures
          
          the hunters drop a net of woven vines behind neytiri and 
          
                                                                     135
          
          
          
          the samson hits it hard the net fouls the ship flipping it
          backwards it crashes upside down to the forest floor
          kaboom!!
          
          neytiris banshee is hit by groundfire it folds up like a
          broken kite crashing down through branches and 
          
          she slams into the ground stunned
          
          in the dragon quaritch looks ahead seeing the well of souls
          he taps the pilot and points

          him by aircom headset
          
                              jake
                    we have to stop the shuttles no matter
                    what it takes
          
          tsutey nods he signals gathering other hunters who fall
          in with him as he dives jake rolls in after them but 
          
          a gunship drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as 
          
          tsutey leads the attack on the first shuttle hunters jink
          and weave through withering fire from the escort ships
          
          gunners with jerryrigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
          the shuttles picking off banshees who get past the escort
          
          tsutey is raked by a burst from the dorsal gunners his
          mount crumples plummeting with a dying scream and 
          
          we spiral down with him the forest rushing up and 
          
          a blinding blizzard of green as he tears downward catching
          at leaves and vines he slams to the ground badly injured
          
          nearby ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
          floor firing their cannons and flamethrowers the gau90s
          rip the forest to shreds

          lifting him painfully

          a tree troopers are seconds from seeing her as 
          
          neytiri knocks an arrow to her fathers bow and readies
          herself for a last kamikaze shot when 
          
          the trooper on the far right of the firing line sees
          something on his screens

          the troopers become aware of the ground shaking a slow
          building thunderous roar and 
          
          an ampsuit comes flying out of the trees cartwheeling past
          them and the shaking builds 
          
                                                                      137

          the troopers pivot to face 
          
          a wall of charging hammerheads crashing out of the foliage in
          a shower of broken branches as 
          
          the troopers open fire but  the stampede drives over them
          like a wave treetrunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits
          troopers are crushed or asphyxiated
          
          nearby the footsoldiers see living shadows flow out of the
          gloom as 
          
          viperwolves race among them with flashing jaws the troopers
          fire wildly as they go down hitting each other as much as
          their attackers
          
          the survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of
          the shadows

          converge on quaritchs ships they literally darken the sky

          a gunner fires from the door of a samson there is a crash
          and the head of a banshee lunges in the open door jerking
          him out other banshees tear at the pilots windshield
          
          neytiri watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in
          disarray the viperwolves flash past her ignoring her
          
          she senses something and turns slowly to see 
          
          a thanator emerging from the smoke behind her a glistening
          black demon she stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze
          
           and the thanator lowers itself until its head is just
          above the ground it holds that position  waiting

          the lead shuttle which is already besieged by winged
          creatures
          
          the cargo ramp is the scene of a pitched battle navi
          hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves
          overwhelming the troopers
          
          hunters are shot falling out of the ship as others fly in
          they shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp and
          troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage
          
          the panicked crew chief slams a switch and the ramp begins to
          close a second before he is cut down by a spear

          swoops down flairs to reduce speed rolls off his mount and
          lands tumbling on the shuttles broad back as 
          
          gunners try to swing their guns toward him but he rakes them
          with his ar still running forward and

          jake leaps into space landing on the back of his mount and
          reconnecting they flap away gaining altitude as fire
          blasts out of the bottom of the shuttle
          
          on the flight deck the pilot feels the ship dropping

          still falls its remaining lift fans screaming until 
          
          its clipping the tree tops when it gets enough translational
          lift to fly and

          hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest

          with no rider he snaplooks aft to see 
          
          jake sprinting along the spine of the ship yanking two
          grenades from his battleharness pulling the pins with his
          teeth then 
          
          quaritchs hand shoots out and slams the pilots cyclic stick
          hard over the dragon lurches sideways rolling sharply with
          a roar of protesting rotors and 
          
          jake is flung off his feet the grenades miss the turbine
          intakes one bounces off the ship the other lodges against
          a cowling and

          blows a two meter hole in the hull

          holding his breath quaritch blows a rescue hatch and leans
          outside jake sees him aim his massive pistol
          
          kwham! kwham! rounds clang next to jakes head he lets go
          plummeting into the trees

          as neytiri taught him  it bends down breaking his fall

          he lets go dropping again only to catch another leaf and
          then another and 
          
          we rush down with him through this green blur   jake drops to
          the ground in a feral crouch unhurt

          she pours on the coal and the samson leaps forward straight
          at the warship
          
          quaritch drills a stream of tracers at her tearing through
          her canopy ripping chunks off her fuselage

          instant yanks back on the stick and 
          
          the samson leaps straight up and  kkrash!! shears off the
          cockpit of the dragon as

          trudys samson disintegrates the wreckage burning as it
          tumbles into the jungle
          
          miles quaritch grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open
          front of the fuselage wind howls through wreckage where the
          pilot used to be the forest rushes up to meet him and 
          
          the dragon crashes through splintering trees impacting in a
          lake with a white blast of water

          outside the window max sits in the cab of an enormous slash
          cutter max flips selfridge the bird and pushes a lever

          krashhhhh! the spinning teeth of the slashcutter tear
          through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air alarms
          go off the technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of
          glass and shredded debris

          sees something through the foliage ahead  the shack
          
          inside the shack jake is oblivious under the link through a
          window we see quaritchs ampsuit step into the clearing
          
          quaritch levels his gau90 at the shack his finger goes to
          the firing button
          
          wham!! a sixlegged black demon tackles him
          
          quaritch pivots as he falls firing the cannon it misses
          neytiri by inches he grapples with the thanator as its
          razor claws screech over his metal armor
          
          the titans twist and struggle quaritch unleashes a long
          burst from the cannon rounds tear into the creature which
          shrieks but 
          
          neytiri wills it to smash the cannon hard against a rock
          tearing it loose from the suits hand but 
          
          quaritch slams the thanator back against a treetrunk almost
          crushing neytiri
          
          close on one hydraulic hand as it draws the suits knife
          and 
          
          quaritch twists violently ramming the knife up under the
          thanators chest armor the creature roars and quaritch flips
          on top of it stabbing
          
          quaritch stabs down again the thanator slumps pinning
          neytiris legs under its great bulk she is trapped
          
          quaritch looks down at neytiri she glares back at him
          panting scared but defiant

          quaritch surges forward jake closes fast snatching up the
          broken cannon as 
          
                                                                      146
          
          
          
          quaritch slashes down with the knife and jake parries
          blocking it with the cannon he closes faster than the suit
          can move and 
          
          kcrack!  slams the end of the cannon into the canopy
          crazing it with a web of cracks as quaritch slices air with
          the huge knife jake ducks coming up to meet the next slash
          and 
          
          smashes the knife hand with the cannon once  twice  again
           in a furious attack  knocking the knife flying
          
          quaritch catches him with the other arm hurling him away
          jake rolls just before 
          
          thuddd!  the massive foot stomps down where he just was he
          scrambles up as quaritch charges and 
          
          jake ducks another roundhouse leaping forward to smash the
          canopy again  then again  until it is white with cracks
          quaritch manages to grab the cannon barrel but 
          
          inside the cockpit he sees nothing but the sun on the
          shattered glass he hurls the cannon blindly but jake ducks
          the massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and 
          
          from inside we see it crash against pressure window crazing
          it but not penetrating jakes link sits just inside
          
          inside the cockpit quaritch yanks a yellow handle and 
          
          pfoom!  the canopy blows off flying through the air
          quaritch can see again he dons his breathing mask bends to
          pick up his knife
          
          nearby neytiri struggles furiously trying to get her legs
          free from underneath three tons of thanator
          
          quaritch panting glowers at jake
          
                              quaritch
                    how does it feel to betray your own race
          
          then inexplicably he turns   walks away
          
          from inside the shack we see him charge straight toward us
          and 
          
          crash!  he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
          window he is reaching inside for the link when 
          
          jake hits in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
          has knocking the ampsuit sideways and 
          
                                                                      147
          
          
          
          jake reaches around the suit grabbing quaritchs shoulder
          and yanks him forward hard smashing his face into the edge
          of the cockpit but 
          
          quaritch flings him off with a sweep of his arm and jake
          slams to the ground
          
          inside the link jake is holding his breath as the toxic
          pandoran air swirls in gas alarms shriek
          
          neytiri shoves with one free leg desperately trying to pull
          her other leg out
          
          the ampsuit charges the knife flashing down and 
          
          jake just manages to catch it in both hands but the force of
          the attack drives him to his knees as 
          
          quaritch pushes the knife down inexorably until jake is
          pinned against a rock the blade now inches from his throat
          
          inside the link jake is straining to stay conscious to stay
          connected as 
          
          the knife reaches his throat as 
          
          thwap! an arrow appears in quaritchs chest   he looks up
          
          neytiri stands  a fury released a classic archer figure
          she nocks another arrow then draws and releases smoothly
          
          thwhap! the machine topples off jake and lies still
          
          quaritch stares at the two arrows in his chest he touches
          the feathers of the ancient weapon then  with an ironic
          laugh  he dies
          
          neytiri runs up another arrow nocked bow drawn seeing
          quaritch she lowers her fathers bow
          
          jake sees her then goes limp his eyes rolling back and 
          
          int shack
          
          human jake explodes out of the link slamming to the floor
          where he gags for breath with his last strength he claws
          toward an emergency breathing mask  across the room
          
          he scrambles toward it on the edge of unconsciousness
          
          neytiri vaults through the shattered window landing in the
          debris like a cat she grabs the mask and flashes to jakes
          side  puts the mask over his face and 
          
                                                                    148
          
          
          
          jake drags in breath after breath he looks up at neytiri
          studying him as she holds him  seeing his human body for
          the first time
          
          jake touches her face his pale human hand against the blue
          of her skin there eyes meet across the glass of the mask 
          together separate worldless
